AB  - International bi-lateral agreements to support the conservation of rainforests to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are growing in prevalence. In 2009, the governments of Guyana and Norway established Guyana's Low Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS). We examine the extent to which the participation and inclusion of Guyana's indigenous population within the LCDS is being achieved. We conducted a single site case study, focussing on the experiences and perceptions from the Amerindian community of Chenapou. Based on 30 interviews, we find that a deficit of adequate dialogue and consultation has occurred in the six years since the LCDS was established. Moreover, key indigenous rights, inscribed at both a national and international level, have not been upheld with respect to the community of Chenapou. Our findings identify consistent shortcomings to achieve genuine participation and the distinct and reinforced marginalisation of Amerindian communities within the LCDS. A further critique is the failure of the government to act on previous research, indicating a weakness of not including indigenous groups in the Guyana-Norway bi-lateral agreement. We conclude that, if the government is to uphold the rights of Amerindian communities in Guyana, significant adjustments are needed. A more contextualised governance, decentralising power and offering genuine participation and inclusion, is required to support the engagement of marginal forest-dependent communities in the management of their natural resources.

AB  - Background Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 17 focuses on North/South partnerships for sustainable development. Literature on research partnerships and capacity -building often neglects how these processes are carried out in practice, their social impacts and participants' subjective experiences. Recognizing the increasingly global dimensions of Higher Education Institutions, the University Development and Innovation - Africa project (UDI-A) was designed to train lecturers and administrative staff of Angolan and Mozambican Universities through collaborations with European institutions, aiming at strengthening African academic and social landscapes through knowledge translation and dissemination. This paper examines potential outcomes of UDI-A on participants' academic pathways, investigating the conflict between different imaginaries of capacity-building and partnerships, focusing on how Angolan and Mozambican health sciences researchers experience international collaborations. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven health academics, as well as a focus group discussion involving all participants. These were recorded, fully transcribed, anonymized and coded to identify common themes. A consent form was signed by all participants. Results and discussion UDI-A was considered innovative, fostering the improvement of pedagogical skills and increasing social entrepreneurship activities. Participants arrived with a specific institutional mandate and believed that the training received should be incorporated into institutional practices to "modernize" these specific Portuguese speaking African Universities and the health sector. The institutional mechanisms put in place to attain this goal, Centres for Academic Development and Innovation ("CADIs"), were considered potential research and development hubs and drivers of academic and societal transformation. Nevertheless, participants shared a sense of asymmetry (infrastructural, financial, in terms of access to information) between them and European trainers. Although this asymmetry was the underlying basis of this capacity-building project, they argued that UDI-A did not fully acknowledge their local contexts, compromising the prospective development of partnerships in the health field. Conclusions More attention should be devoted to understanding how participants experience capacity building processes, integrating the diversity of their aspirations and perceptions into subsequent phases of the project, requiring the development of methodological innovations to increase the impact of these programs.

AB  - Large parts of the East European forest-steppe are covered by agricultural and pastoral landscapes with decreasing proportions of semi-natural meadow steppes and fragments of semi-natural woodland. Although numerous palynological records indicate that a total deforestation occurred in the last 500 years, the details of the transformation from natural vegetation into an agrarian landscape are still lacking as well as an evaluation of the political role in this process. This study focuses on the vegetation and fire history at the northern edge of the forest-steppe in the Kursk region (Russia) and aim to reconstruct the transformation process in its historical context. New pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs and charcoal records with decennial to centennial resolution obtained from the Seim River region enable a comprehensive reconstruction of the local and regional landscape history over the last 1100 years. The palynological records provide unique insights into the heterogeneous vegetation cover of microregions and evidence spatial asynchronous deforestation and crop field creation. The findings highlight a crucial role of political systems on the formation of agro-pastoral landscapes with small remaining forest patches of today. The heterogeneity of the natural vegetation distribution before major deforestation as well as the duration of human impact should be considered in ecosystem restoration projects.

AB  - Hydrogen energy plays an important role in solving the environmental problems caused by the fuel crisis and greenhouse gas emissions. However, hydrogen application on an industrial scale still requires technological advances, especially in choosing the best technological route for the recovery of renewable and cost-effective hydrogen. Therefore, this bibliometric review evaluated the research progress, trends, updates, and hotspots on hydrogen production from dark fermentation. The Web of Science(C) database was used to select the documents from 2000 to 2021, and the VOSviewer(C) and Bibliometrix softwares were used to carry out the bibliometric investigation. The results demonstrated that 3071 documents (2755 articles and 316 reviews) studied the hydrogen production from dark fermentation over the last 21 years. The number of publications exponentially increased in the last five years, which can be associated with the demand for new technologies to produce clean energy sources and decrease the environmental impacts caused by petroleum-based fuel. Keyword analysis revealed that the studies focused on the operational parameters, process optimization, pretreatment, and microbial community, aiming to increase the hydrogen yield during dark fermentation. Finally, this comprehensive review provides future directions for applying dark fermentation to produce hydrogen as a sustainable and renewable fuel in a biorefiney concept.

AB  - Next-generation sequencing and computational biology has unravelled the different bacterial groups populating plant microbiomes. In addition, microbiologists have discovered many different mechanisms of cell-cell interactions that take place between bacteria. Bacteria use four prevalent mechanisms for intercellular interactions; however, their pertinent role in the formation and maintenance of plant microbiomes is currently unknown. We argue that it is overdue to speed up research on the biotic cell-cell interactions that take place between bacteria in plant microbiomes. This research will have a major impact on both fundamental sciences and translational agriculture via the development of bacterial prebiotic compounds as well probiotics competence, resulting in a more sustainable agriculture of economically important crops.

AB  - Urbanisation, climate change and natural hazards present serious challenges for the Caribbean which Habitat III brought into focus. This paper critically examines problems associated with these complex challenges, to propose a relevant Caribbean specific New Urban Agenda and suggest implementation mechanisms which are essential to forge ahead. It reviews urban issues for fifteen countries that constitute the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). These problems are investigated from the perspective of four pillars of economic, social and environmental sustainability, and governance. The paper reveals that with the application of these main components and related thematic elements, many countries in this grouping are underperforming in achieving the sustainable development goal of safe, resilient and sustainable urban settlements. The main conclusion drawn is that countries of the CARICOM Caribbean should not adopt an imported blueprint to resolve critical urban issues. This is an opportune time for crafting a relevant indigenous New Urban Agenda for CARICOM Caribbean countries and finding the right implementation mechanisms to be at the frontline of change.

AB  - Reconciling conservation and social justice imperatives is a major challenge facing many postcolonial states worldwide. Where historically disenfranchised communities have laid legal claim to protected areas, the typical resolution has been collaborative management agreements between the state and claimant communities. The real outcomes of such strategies for people and ecosystems have been seriously questioned, although alternative approaches are seldom explored. Here, we reflect on one such alternative that was pursued in a case in South Africa, where the land was handed back to the community and a replacement protected area created. Our objective was to explore the opportunities and trade-offs associated with this approach for communities and conservation agencies alike, and to compare these to typical collaborative management outcomes. Methods included key informant interviews, focus group discussions and household surveys. We find that, surprisingly, this approach created more benefits for the conservation agency than for claimant communities. Indeed, the community experiences bore a striking resemblance to those experienced in collaborative management settings: intra-community conflict, confusion over leadership and serious questions about the boundaries of the "community". Processes aimed at redressing past injustice in disputes over conservation land, regardless of the approach adopted, must bring with them a strong commitment to building institutional and leadership capacities within communities, and pay serious attention to the ways in which equity and social justice can be fostered after the settlement of a land claim. Settlement agreements are frequently treated as the final step towards social justice, but are in fact just the beginning.

AB  - This study draws on legitimacy theory to investigate the relationship between mandatory disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions by companies that are subject to specific environmental legislation (the Australian National Greenhouse Energy Reporting Act 2007) and the level of voluntary environmental disclosures. Using a sample of 535 observations, we find that i) Overall, legislation-affected companies increase their disclosures compared with non-affected companies, ii) As many companies reduce their disclosures as increase them, iii) there is an increase in the level of emissions volume disclosures in legislation-affected companies compared with the same company pre-implementation, iv) legislation-affected higher emitters have higher levels of voluntary disclosures. These findings are consistent with legitimacy theory, which predicts differential disclosures in circumstances to avoid scrutiny. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The future of the global environment is at threat due to global warming and climate change primarily driven by greenhouse gas emissions. Bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage/utilisation (BECCS/U) through its CO2 negative emission capacity is considered a principal component of global mitigation strategies as agreed in the Paris climate change agreement. In this study, the current global status and efforts to implement BECCS systems are comprehensively reviewed. The potential for thermochemical conversion processes (combustion, gasification, pyrolysis, and liquefaction) to manifest within BECCS systems is analysed, in addition to their integration potential with carbon dioxide capture methods. Outcomes suggest that gasification and combustion processes when integrated with CO2 capture and storage (CCS), within combine heat and power (CHP) configurations, biomass integrated gasification combine cycle (BIGCC) and chemical looping cycle (CLC) are mature technologies. Furthermore, this review indicates that pyrolysis and liquefaction process are commercial and lab-scale respectively. When integrated within BECCS systems, pyrolysis systems are at the pilot level and liquefaction processes are at lab scale. Moreover, a comprehensive discussion on the negative emission potential from various BECCS configurations is provided, highlighting their role in advancing bio-refineries through waste management and conversion to value-added products such as biochar, ethanol, bio diesel etc. The pyrolysis process has CO2 mitigation potential of 2.2 GtCO(2)/year by 2020-2050. Finally, an insight into the commercial barriers and future perspectives of BECCS technologies, role of international supply chains therein, and the need for effective stakeholder management to facilitate BECCS systems within global trade.

AB  - Water contamination is one of the most pressing environmental issues of the present. There is a significant amount of interest in the slow pyrolysis of biomass to produce biochar, a solid byproduct that is stable and rich in carbon. Adsorbents manufactured from hydrochars, sometimes referred to as hydrochar created by hydrothermal methods, have been tested for the removal of possible contaminants from wastewater. The hydrothermal processes of hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) and liquefaction (HTL) yield hydrochars, a distinct category of biochar. Because of its peak efficiency, large surface area, large size of pore and capacity to regenerate, hydrochar is an acceptable option for the rehabilitation of a range of pollutants. The formation, activation, identification, and use of biochar and hydrochar were highlighted in this review. The physiochemical properties of the char produced by the two processes are very different, which has an impact on their potential uses in areas like wastewater pollution remediation, soil improvement, greenhouse gas emission and carbon sequestration among others.

AB  - This analysis considers the implications of Sharma v Minister for the Environment [2021] FCA 560 and its finding of a novel duty of care owed by the Australian Government to children to prevent climate harms. While the judgment of a single Federal Court justice is likely to be appealed and did not result in an injunction halting the coal mine, its close consideration of scientific evidence of climate impacts and recognition of the special vulnerability of children has potentially profound ramifications for the ongoing development of climate litigation, both in Australia and globally. More broadly, the Sharma decision adds to growing momentum for governments to be held accountable for their actions on climate change, effectively calling for a duty to care in the face of inter-generational injustices inflicted by inaction on reducing greenhouse gas emissions to safe levels.

AB  - Climatic design conditions are widely used by the building community as environmental parameters informing the size and energy requirements for heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, along with other building design characteristics. Climatic design conditions are calculated by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-conditioning Engineers using historical climate data. Our work advances methods for projecting future climate design conditions based on data from global climate models. These models do not typically archive the hourly data required for climate design condition calculations, and they often exhibit large biases in extreme conditions, daily minimum temperatures and daily maximum temperatures needed for climatic design conditions. We present a method for rescaling historical hourly data under future climatic states to estimate the impact of climate change on future building climatic design conditions. This rescaling method is then used to calculate future climatic design conditions in Madison, Wisconsin, throughout the 21st century for two future greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. The results are consistent with a warming climate and show increases in heating, cooling, humidification and dehumidification design conditions, suggesting less extreme cold conditions and more extreme hot and humid conditions in Madison. The design conditions used for estimating energy demand, degree days, show that under a business-as-usual scenario, by the mid-century, building heating and cooling in Madison (climate zone 5A) will be similar to the current heating demand in Chicago, IL (climate zone 5A) and cooling demand in Baltimore, MD (climate zone 4A); by the late-century, building heating and cooling in Madison will resemble the current heating demand in St Louis, MO (climate zone 4A) and cooling demand in Augusta, GA (climate zone 3A). Given the rapid pace of climate change in the 21st century, our work suggests that historical design conditions may become obsolete during even the initial stages of a building's expected life span. Changes in climatic design conditions in Madison highlight the importance of considering future climatic changes in building design to ensure that buildings built today meet the performance needs of the future.

AB  - Rapid growth in both global energy demand and carbon dioxide emissions associated with the use of fossil fuels has driven the search for alternative sources which are renewable and have a lower environmental impact. This paper reviews the availability and bioenergy potentials of the current biomass feedstocks. These include (i) food crops such as sugarcane, corn and vegetable oils, classified as the first generation feedstocks, and (ii) lignocellulosic biomass derived from agricultural and forestry residues and municipal waste, as second generation feedstocks. The environmental and socioeconomic limitations of the first generation feedstocks have placed greater emphasis on the lignocellulosic biomass, of which the conversion technologies still faces major constraints to full commercial deployment. Key technical challenges and opportunities of the lignocellulosic biomass-to-bioenergy production are discussed in comparison with the first generation technologies. The potential of the emerging third generation biofuel from algal biomass is also reviewed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Centrifugal pumps are fundamental machines in our daily life. Indeed, they can be found everywhere, for instance, in domestic, civil, industrial, and agricultural fields. In the last years, the pump market has newly gained a boost coherently with the world demographic growth. Pumps are among the main responsible for electric energy consumption, therefore even a slight efficiency improvement (+1%) can be effective in contrasting the growth of the global Greenhouse Gas Emissions (at least -570 tCO(2)/day in Europe). For this reason, a new generation of centrifugal pumps is here proposed. In particular, the impeller has been redesigned improving the flow guidance inside the vanes and simultaneously reducing the number of blades, with the aim to increase the blade loading, reducing manufacturing costs, and enhancing the conversion efficiency with respect to conventional configurations. Furthermore, the new impeller design respects all the geometrical constraints of the corresponding conventional configuration, allowing its retrofit with a boost of performance. To reach these goals, a 1D in-house code has been developed implementing a Harmony Search Algorithm (HSA) for the selection of the most suitable design point (H and Q), and introducing two parameters for the blade loading evaluation, namely, the blade pressure coefficient (C-p,C- blade), computed locally along the impeller blade walls, and the blade lift coefficient (C-L), achieving an optimal vane arrangement. Starting from a baseline centrifugal pump, the novel impeller has been designed, manufactured, and finally experimentally tested. The resulting new generation of centrifugal pumps actually proves to have a higher performance (maximum efficiency at BEP +1%), a flatter efficiency curve, and a monotone bending characteristic curve, while keeping unchanged the required Net Positive Suction Head (NPSH3%).

AB  - This study aims to propose a novel framework for strength prediction and multi-objective optimization (MOO) of economical and environmentally sustainable ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) which aids in intelligent, sustainable, and resilient construction. Different tree- and boosting ensemble-based machine learning (ML) models are integrated to form an accurate and reliable prediction model for the uniaxial compressive strength of UHPC. The optimized models are integrated into a super learner model, resulting in a robust predictive model that is used as one of the objective functions in the MOO problem. A total of 19 objective functions are considered, including cost, uniaxial compressive strength, and 17 environmental impact categories that comprehensively evaluate the environmental sustainability of the UHPC mix. The resulting impacts from the mid-point indicators were calculated using the Eco-invent v3.7 Life Cycle Inventory database. The results showed that the super learner model accurately predicted the uniaxial compressive strength of UHPC. The MOO resulted in Pareto fronts, demonstrating the trade-off among the uniaxial compressive strength, cost, and environmental sustainability of the mix and a broad range of solutions that can be obtained for the 19 objectives. The study provides a useful tool for designers and decision-makers to select the optimal UHPC mixture that meets specific project requirements. Finally, for the practical application of the ML predictive model and MOO algorithm for UHPC, a graphical user interface-based software tool, FAI-OSUSCONCRET, was developed. This software tool offers fast, accurate, and intelligent predictions and multi-objective optimizations tailored to specific project requirements, thus resulting in a UHPC mixture that perfectly meets project needs.

AB  - Biodiesel is a notable alternative to petroleum derived diesel fuel because it comes from natural domestic sources and thus reduces dependence on diminishing petroleum fuel from foreign sources, it likely lowers lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, and it lowers an engine's emission of most pollutants as compared to petroleum derived diesel. However, the use of biodiesel often slightly increases a diesel engine's emission of smog forming nitrogen oxides (NOx) relative to petroleum diesel. In this paper, previously proposed theories for this slight NOx increase are reviewed, including theories based on biodiesel's cetane number, which leads to differing amounts of charge preheating, and theories based on the fuel's bulk modulus, which affects injection timing. This paper proposes an additional theory for the slight NOx increase of biodiesel. Biodiesel typically contains more double bonded molecules than petroleum derived diesel. These double bonded molecules have a slightly higher adiabatic flame temperature, which leads to the increase in NOx production for biodiesel. Our theory was verified using numerical simulations to show a NOx increase, due to the double bonded molecules, that is consistent with observation. Further, the details of these numerical simulations show that NOx is predominantly due to the Zeldovich mechanism. Published by Elsevier B. V.

AB  - Geospatial cellular automata (Geo-CA) models have encountered challenges in computing efficiency and scalability when conducting large-scale land use change simulation applications. Parallel computing has proven to be effective to address these challenges. However, parallelization strategies for existing parallel Geo-CA models are always optimized for specific models and lack applicability to others. Besides, most parallel Geo-CA models focus on parallelizing land use change simulations, ignoring land use transition rule mining. Moreover, there is a lack of effective parallel strategies for demand-constrained land use change simulation on distributed heterogeneous architectures. This study proposes a parallel framework on hybrid parallel computing architectures applicable for raster-based Geo-CA models to enhance their computing efficiency and scalability while maintaining simulation accuracy. The framework provides parallelization strategies for both the land use transition rule mining for multiple land use types and the demand-constrained land use change simulation on distributed heterogeneous architectures. The framework was employed to parallelize two contemporary Geo-CA models, i.e., PLUS and MCCA. Experiments showed that the parallelized models achieved significant improvements in computing efficiency and scalability, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed framework for large-scale land use change simulation studies.

AB  - Soil decontamination and restoration continue to be a key environmental concern around the globe. The degradation of soil resources due to the presence of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) has a substantial influence on agricultural production, food security, and human well-being, and as a result, urgent action is required. PTEs pollution is not a threat to the agroecosystems but also a serious concern to human health; thereby, it needs to be addressed timely and effectively. Hence, the development of improved and cost-effective procedures to remove PTEs from polluted soils is imperative. With this context in mind, current review is designed to distinctly envisage the PTEs removal potential by the single and binary applications of biochar (BC) and nanomaterials (NMs).2 Recently, BC, a product of high-temperature biomass pyrolysis with high specific surface area, porosity, and distinctive physical and chemical properties has become one of the most used and economic adsorbent materials. Also, biochar's application has generated interest in a variety of fields and environments as a modern approach against the era of urbanization, industrialization, and climate change. Likewise, several NMs including metals and their oxides, carbon materials, zeolites, and bimetallic-based NMs have been documented as having the potential to remediate PTEs-polluted environments. However, both techniques have their own set of advantages and disadvantages, therefore combining them can be a more effective strategy to address the growing concern over the rapid accumulation and release of PTEs into the environment.

AB  - For the last five years the technology factor (by which is meant both process and product innovation) has received renewed attention in the transport sector as society is confronted with new challenges. This leads to a call for change and transitions. Technology is considered as a potential answer to new needs and new problems, like the reduction of CO(2) and the supply of alternative energy. It is important that there is a theoretical basis for the way of thinking on innovation and diffusion when it comes to technology dynamics. This paper, based on a literature study, addresses the question to what extent the theory of transition management can be considered as a new application of technology dynamics. The theory of technological innovations in the broad sense is analysed and applied to the transport sector.

AB  - BackgroundErectile dysfunction (ED) is one of the causes of male infertility and is a disease that requires treatment. The first-line drugs for ED are phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors, and further treatment options are currently limited. Medical technologies, such as genetic control and regenerative medicine, are developing rapidly. Research on erectile function is progressing rapidly, coupled with technological innovations in other areas. MethodsA PubMed search using the keywords "animal (rat, mouse, rabbit, dog, and monkey)" and "erectile" was conducted, and all relevant peer-reviewed English results were evaluated. Main findingsThe methods for evaluating erectile function include intracavernous pressure (ICP) measurements, isometric tension studies, and dynamic infusion cavernosometry. Papers also reported various disease model animals for the study of diabetes mellitus, cavernous nerve injury, and drug-induced ED. ConclusionBasic research on ED treatment has progressed rapidly over the past 20 years. In particular, research on the mechanism of ED has been accelerated by the publication of a study on the evaluation of erectile function using ICP measurements in rats. In addition, molecular biological experimental methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blotting have become relatively easy to perform due to technological progress, thus advancing research development.

AB  - To address concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and sea level rise brought on by global climate change, hydrogen (H2) has the capacity to substitute fossil fuels as a carbon-free source of energy. The most reliable method of producing H2 is photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, which uses water and solar as renewable energy sources. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is one of the excellent semiconductors utilized as an effective photoanode in PEC water splitting due to its efficient light absorption, cost-effectiveness and excellent photostability. The primary emphasis of this review was on the various techniques used to modify TiO2-based photoanodes and presents a comprehensive overview of the latest progress made towards improving their effectiveness for PEC water splitting. It involves different preparation methods of TiO2-based photoanodes such as hydrothermal, chemical vapor, physical vapor, electrochemical deposition, and other methods which plays a crucial role in determining their structural, morphological, and surface properties. These properties, in turn, influence the light absorption, charge transport, and PEC water splitting activity, ultimately affecting the effectiveness and efficiency of PEC water splitting. Furthermore, elaboration on the outcomes of modification on the physicalchemical-optical features of TiO2-based photoanodes that result from preparation methods is included in this review. The review provides valuable understanding regarding the creation and advancement of high-performing TiO2-based photoanodes in the sustainable energy generation.

In addition, this system can provide cooling without greenhouse gas emissions. Hence, many combinations of different components might be adopted to apply the solar absorption cooling system. This paper will discuss the absorption chiller working cycle, the absorption chiller working fluids, the solar collectors to be combined with solar cooling systems and the single-effect absorption chiller. Furthermore, the variation of the coefficient of performance, the solar fraction and the economic study will be discussed. The goal of this review is to present previous studies and analyze their results; highlight the environmental, energetic, and economic viability of such systems and tackle future challenges regarding solar absorption cooling system and discuss the application of this system on new climates and more specifically on Lebanon.

AB  - The Seveso II-Directive requires that the objectives of preventing major accidents and limiting their consequences be taken into account by the Member States in their land-use policies and/or other relevant policies. This is to be achieved by ensuring adequate distances between industrial establishments and residential areas, areas of public use and areas of particular natural sensitivity or interest. A risk-based framework implemented in a computer program is presented which enables one to calculate adequate distances. The criterion used is a limit on the individual risk of death. The method is a simplified risk analysis which represents the plant, whose characteristics are normally unknown at the stage of land-use planning, by generic frequencies of release for process units and storage tanks. Their number depends on the size of the site to be allotted. The procedure is capable of addressing the siting of new establishments and, with due regard to the simplifications used, modifications to and new developments in the vicinity of existing establishments. Given the numerous assumptions, which have to be made, the framework represents a convention. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The lifetime of a catalytic converters is limited. Today's environmental regulations require that used converters should be properly recycled as a valuable source of precious metals, Al2O3 and steel scrap. The precious metals used in the devices perform catalytic functions. They are suspended in a ceramic or metal carrier. This paper deals with the recovery of precious metals from automotive converters using a metal-collector method. In order to speed up the washout of the precious metals from the capillary structure of the converter, the movement of the liquid metal-collector was forced by the electromagnetic field. The research was aimed at improving the effective velocity of the liquid metal flow through the carrier by means of a device with a double windings. Various ways of power supply were considered. The calculation experiment was performed as a weakly coupled analysis of the electromagnetic field and flow field.

AB  - Petroleum-contaminated site management typically counts destruction of hydrocarbons by either natural or engineered processes as a beneficial component of remediation. While such oxidation of spilled hydrocarbons is often necessary for achieving risk reduction for nearby human and ecological receptors, site assessments tend to neglect that this also means that the pollutants are converted to greenhouse gases and emitted to the atmosphere. This article presents a suggestion that the current and long term greenhouse gas emissions from spilled hydrocarbons be incorporated to petroleum site assessments. This would provide a more complete picture of pollutant effects that could then be incorporated to remedial objectives. At some sites, this additional information may affect remedy selection. Possible examples include a shift in emphasis to remedial technologies that reduce pollutant greenhouse gas effects (e.g., by conversion of methane to carbon dioxide in the subsurface), and a more holistic context for considering remedial technologies with low emission footprints.

AB  - A survey of lead-based paint abatement projects in public buildings of Crawford and Erie Counties, Pennsylvania, was conducted during the time period January 1995 to March 1997. These survey results suggest that few lead abatement projects were performed during this time period. Projects that were performed commonly did not employ proper lead abatement practices as described by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. These data suggest that most contractors and public officials have misunderstandings of both environmental regulations and required procedures for safe and effective lead-based paint abatement, (C) 1998 Academic Press.

AB  - Payment methods have been undergoing a series of developments and changes in recent years due to technological innovations, policy support, and epidemics. This literature review comprehensively examines 265 articles on payment methods over the past decade from various perspectives (consumer, technology, merchant, meso-macro, etc.), focusing on research within the hospitality and tourism sector. Our review indicates that while research on payment methods in the hospitality and tourism field is less extensive than in other domains, it covers a wide range of topics. The most prevalent scenarios for payment methods in hospitality and tourism include restaurants, hotels, transportation, medical tourism, and the sustainability of payment methods. Among these, mobile payments are extensively explored, and digital currencies (including cryptocurrencies and Central Bank Digital Currency) are poised to be the next innovation in payment methods within the hospitality and tourism sector. Although biometric payments have received less attention, the growing habit of using biometrics (fingerprints, face recognition) to unlock personal devices is helping to promote this payment method. Additionally, this study identifies areas for future research focus and direction for scholars while providing both theoretical and practical contributions.

AB  - Blue carbon sequestration is a nature-based solution to environmental problems caused by climate change and has a significant positive impact on the planet and human well-being. This paper bibliometrically and system-atically analyzed 2,613 studies found in the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) from 2003 to 2021 to explore the hotspots and trends of blue carbon research using the Bibliometrix package in R studio and VOS-viewer software. The results based on network co-occurrence analysis indicated that mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes were the major blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs), and mangrove carbon sinks were the most popular central research area. Furthermore, phytoplankton and microalgae have essential roles in the marine carbon cycle and bioenergy utilization, as revealed by the high proportion of published literature, while the carbon transport mechanisms of seagrass and macroalgae was understudied. Thematic evolution analysis revealed that remote sensing was the most commonly used technology as an emerging research field for ecological monitoring and ecological investigation in blue carbon research in recent years. In addition, increasing carbon sinks by artificial approaches, fishery carbon sinks, and carbon sequestration by macroalgae have been potential hotspots for blue carbon research development. The findings from this study shed light on the trends of blue carbon in the past eighteen years, current research points in the field, and areas that need more research investment going forward.

AB  - The Asia-Pacific region includes a majority of the world's population and many of its most rapidly growing economies. It is also home to the world's largest number of extremely poor people, many fragile states, and unsustainable environmental practices. The region has increased its influence in the world economy but is still grappling to overcome complex interrelated challenges of poverty, inequality and sustainable development. Its priorities must be addressed as a central element of any post-2015 global development goal framework. Drawing from lessons of the Millennium Development Goals, this paper suggests a conceptual framework to guide a new generation of goals, along with an intergovernmental approach to implementation. The "ZEN" framework stresses the distinct challenges of achieving zero extreme poverty (Z), setting country-specific "Epsilon" benchmarks for broader development challenges (E), and promoting environmental sustainability both within and across borders (N).

AB  - It is hoped that Automated Driving (AD) will make alternatives to the private car more attractive and facilitate the transition to sustainable transport. However, this expectation may underestimate both the resistance of private automobility and the unintended consequences of automated driving. Whether AD will contribute to sustainable mobility depends largely on its implementation and how its risks are prevented. This paper provides empirical insights into the design of acceptable forms of AD by investigating specific use cases with respect to the requirements of different mobility configurations. We pay special attention to people who travel with children. Our use cases comprise three probable types, covering the spectrum from demand-responsive transport (DRT) to private vehicles. Our results include the identification of mobility configurations and an analysis of AD use cases considering several empirically derived criteria: improved accessibility, ease of daily life and well-being, and improvement of the traffic situation and the transport system. Our analysis is based on a qualitative study in the Berlin area, Germany. The discussion focuses on the usefulness of AD against the background of different user perspectives, sustainability, and societal requirements, as well as an evaluation of AD in terms of its acceptability. We conclude that automated mobility use cases should meet the requirements of different mobility configurations to promote the transformation from private to shared automobility and, eventually, less automobility overall.

AB  - Adopting net zero neighborhoods (NZN) combined with circular economy are increasingly recognized as an essential strategy for construction companies, allowing their transition towards sustainability and contributing to climate change mitigation. Transforming existing neighborhoods into NZN is necessary to achieve energy selfsufficiency and net zero by 2050. The success of NZN hinges on government initiatives. However, existing studies appear to lack a comprehensive exploration of the transformation initiatives within NZN, spanning aspects like raw materials, construction practices, transportation, and waste management, particularly in terms of technological advancements. To address the gap, this research introduces a conceptual framework that integrates the multiple case studies design method with an urban transformative capacity model. This innovative framework is the first application of a multi-level urban transformative capacity model in transforming existing neighborhoods into NZN within a specific region. This research specifically utilizes South Wales in the UK as a case study. It identified four key initiatives in technology, construction, transportation, and waste management. These initiatives offer significant benefits, including fostering a more sustainable and environmentally friendly construction industry through enhanced traceability and efficiency, and simultaneously promoting social sustainability by improving community engagement, providing social benefits through sharing economy initiatives, and creating new green job opportunities.

AB  - Sweet elephant grass (SEG), a promising bioenergy grass, possesses considerable potential for bioenergy production. However, research on its pretreatment and utilization remains limited. In this study, small quantities of Br & oslash;nsted acids were introduced to a deep eutectic solvent (DES) comprising choline chloride (ChCl) and glycerol (Gly) for SEG pretreatment. Under mild conditions (110 degrees C, 2 h), a maximum lignin removal rate of 90.08 % and a complete hemicellulose removal could be accomplished in the presence of Br & oslash;nsted acid. Cellulose retention rates consistently above 70 % were obtained in all the cases, and a desirable glucose yield up to 94.07 % was achieved from the resulting cellulose after further enzymatic hydrolysis. The pretreatment mechanism was elucidated through a combination of characterizations and theoretical calculations, which demonstrated effective disruption of lignin and lignin-carbohydrate complex occurred by the CH & sdot;& sdot;& sdot;pi, HO & sdot;& sdot;& sdot;H, and Cl & sdot;& sdot;& sdot;H bond interactions between lignin and DES. Furthermore, the scission of beta-O-4 bond was promoted by Br & oslash;nsted acids in DES. This systematic investigation paves the way for unraveling the mechanism of the efficient pretreatment of lignocellulose in acidic DES.

Design/methodology/approach - This research is performed through a bibliographic review in the electronic databases of the Emerald Insight, the Scopus and the Web of Science, considering the main scientific publications on the subject. Findings - The bibliographic search results in 526 articles, followed by two sequential filters for deleting the duplicate articles (resulting in 487 articles) and for selecting the most relevant articles (resulting in 150 articles). Practical implications - This article identifies the opportunities and the challenges focused on the emerging Industry 4.0 theme. The opportunities can contribute to the sustainable performance of the supply chains and their territories. The Industry 4.0 can also generate challenges like the social inequalities related to the position of the man in the labor market by replacing the human workforce with the machines. Therefore, the man-machine relationship in the Industry 4.0 era is analyzed as a gap in the literature. Therefore, as a way to fill this gap, the authors of this article suggest the exploration of the research focused on the Society 5.0. Also known as "super-smart society," this recent theme appeared in Japan in April 2016. According to Fukuda (2020), in addition to the focus on the technological development, the Society 5.0 also aims at the quality of life and the social challenge resolutions. Originality/value - This article contributes to the analysis of the Industry 4.0 technologies as facilitators in the sustainable supply chain performance. It addresses the impacts of the Industry 4.0 technologies applied to the supply chains in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it analyzes the research gaps and limitations found in the literature. The result of this study can add value and stimulate new research studies related to the application of the Industry 4.0 technologies as facilitators in the supply chain sustainable performance. It can encourage the studies related to the COVID-19 impacts on the sustainable supply chains, and it can promote the research development on the relationship among the man, the machine and the labor in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

AB  - Environmental problems are escalating. Alternate fuel vehicles are a technologically viable solution to curb transport-related pollution and greenhouse gas emissions that cause environmental problems. Based on the theory of norms-driven behavior, this study explains how the underlying facets of subjective social norms (injunctive and descriptive) are linked with personal norms (integrated and introjected) and how this linkage leads to eco-socially conscious consumer behavior related to the choice and use of personal cars. Data were collected from 687 automobile customers from eight large cities in Pakistan. The partial least squares structural equation modeling approach was employed to test the hypothesized relationships of the study. The results showed that subjective norms are positively associated with personal norms, and both together lead to eco-socially conscious consumers' behavior related to the choice and use of personal cars. Implications for marketers are suggested to promote alternate fuel vehicles and the eco-social use of personal cars.

Since then, numerous cervid species throughout the US have had deaths confirmed to be caused by AHD. In 2015, the death of two captive moose (Alces americanus gigas) calves marked the first recognized AHD-caused deaths in Alaska, a state in which moose are important economically as well as for food security and cultural identity. Both cases were characterized by systemic vasculitis with endothelial cell intranuclear inclusion bodies, pulmonary edema, petechial hemorrhages, and enterotyphlocolitis.

AB  - In this paper we address why firms comply with environmental regulations when enforcement is weak by suggesting that firms choose their level of environmental compliance strategically. Our theoretical model shows that compliance decisions among firms are strategic complements-increased compliance by one firm will positively influence the compliance rate of its rival. In our empirical analysis we find that the compliance rates of other regulated entities have a positive and significant effect on a regulated source's compliance behavior in three of our four heavily regulated industries. If compliance decisions are strategic complements, this may partially explain high compliance rates in the presence of limited regulatory pressure.

AB  - Objective: To explore what is known about organizational processes that determine whether (and the extent and rate at which) new non-pharmaceutical technologies are adopted and assimilated into routine health care. Methods: Electronic searching of four databases, hand searching of six journals and electronic citation tracking searches of three key research papers. A narrative synthesis was conducted. Results: Ninety-nine empirical studies and seven narrative overviews informed the findings. The majority (62%) of the studies took a deterministic approach (mainly using cross-sectional mailed questionnaires) and typically studied the impact of organizational variables - such as organizational size - on the rate of adoption of technological innovations. The remaining studies were process-based using a single- or multi-case study approach. The organizational processes that determine whether and how technological innovations are adopted and assimilated into routine health care practice are dependent upon the specific innovation concerned, the different actors involved at various points in time, and the particular organizational context in which decisions are made. It is important to see 'adoption' and 'assimilation' as part of an ongoing process rather than discrete events, and as a process that comprises both 'formal' organizational and 'informal' decisions by individual users (the latter often shaped by discussions with their peers and colleagues). Conclusions: Further process-based studies are needed to provide a clearer evidence base for recommendations on how to facilitate the adoption and assimilation of beneficial new technologies. Three theoretical perspectives could form the basis of such studies and produce practical advice for managers and practitioners.

AB  - Biomass is one of the most suitable options to be used as renewable energy source due to its extensive availability and its contribution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass under appropriate conditions (slow heating rate and high temperatures) can produce a quality solid product, which could be applicable to several metallurgical processes as reducing agent (biocoke or bioreducer). Two woody biomass samples (olives and eucalyptus) were pyrolyzed to produce biocoke. These biocokes were characterized by means of proximate and ultimate analysis, real density, specific surface area, and porosity and were compared with three commercial reducing agents. Finally, reactivity tests were performed both with the biocokes and with the commercial reducing agents. Bioreducers have lower ash and sulfur contents than commercial reducers, higher surface area and porosity, and consequently, much higher reactivity. Bioreducers are not appropriate to be used as top burden in blast furnaces, but they can be used as fuel and reducing agent either tuyre injected at the lower part of the blast furnace or in non-ferrous metallurgical processes where no mechanical strength is needed as, for example, in rotary kilns.

AB  - Tourism has a particular responsibility to contribute to climate and biodiversity goals because of its intense use of long-range transport and its strong dependence on natural capital as an asset. Tourism is a major contributor to the global economy, but also to greenhouse gas emissions. The severe impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the tourism sector triggered a search for enhanced resilience, replacing the past paradigm of "boosterism", and the dominant paradigm of "sustainable tourism". Sustainable tourism is no longer sufficient, and a shift towards a new paradigm of regenerative tourism is needed to address the environmental and societal challenges faced by the tourism industry. Here, the evidence pointing at the rise of regenerative tourism as a new paradigm is reviewed, the differential goals of regenerative, relative to sustainable tourism, are defined and actions along five domains of action are identified that can help tourism destinations embrace the transition toward the regenerative tourism paradigm. Regenerative tourism seeks to enhance the natural, cultural and social capital of destinations while creating net positive benefits for people and the planet. It emphasizes collaboration with local communities and an ambitious and holistic approach to sustainability, going beyond reducing negative impacts to creating positive ones. Regenerative tourism aligns the industry, the Paris Agreement, and the Convention on Biological Diversity, while advancing the delivery of the Sustainable Development Goals. The transition to regenerative tourism requires investments in technology and innovation, transparent collaboration, and a holistic focus on well-being for both people and the planet.

We put forward a transformative agenda concerned with workforce ageing that aligns with contemporary expectations regarding sustainability, inequality, and emerging conceptualisations of management. In this article, the new concept of Common Good human resource management (HRM) is utilised as a potential means of encouraging business responses focused on grand challenges such as population ageing. We suggest how these principles might be applied to the issue of managing age in workplaces, to recast debate about issues of age and work, to be used as an advocacy tool encouraging employer engagement, while providing a framework that might direct organisational leadership.

AB  - Transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs) is a prominent strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, given the complexity of atmospheric chemistry, the nuanced implications on air quality are yet to be fully understood. Our study delved into changes in PM2.5, ozone, and their associated precursors in major US urban areas, considering various electrification and mitigation scenarios. In the full electrification (FullE) scenario, PM2.5 reduction peaked at values between 0.34 and 2.29 mu g.m(-3) across distinct regions. Yet, certain areas in eastern Los Angeles exhibited a surprising uptick in PM2.5, reaching as much as 0.67 mu g.m(-3). This phenomenon was linked to a surge in secondary organic aerosols (SOAs), resulting from shifting NOx/VOCs (volatile organic compounds) dynamics and a spike in hydroxyl radical (OH) concentrations. The FullE scenario ushered in marked reductions in both NOx and maximum daily average 8-h (MDA8) ozone concentrations, with maximum levels ranging from 14.00 to 32.34 ppb and 2.58-9.58 ppb, respectively. However, certain instances revealed growths in MDA8 ozone concentrations, underscoring the intricacies of air quality management. From a health perspective, in the FullE scenario, New York, Chicago, and Houston stand to potentially avert 796, 328, and 157 premature deaths/month, respectively. Los Angeles could prevent 104 premature deaths/month in the HighE-BL scenario, representing a 29 % EV share for light-duty vehicles. However, the FullE scenario led to a rise in mortality in Los Angeles due to increased PM2.5 and MDA8 ozone levels. Economically, the FullE scenario projects health benefits amounting to 51-249 million $/day for New York, Chicago, and Houston. In contrast, Los Angeles may face economic downturns of up to 18 million $/day. In conclusion, while EV integration has the potential to improve urban air quality, offering substantial health and economic advantages, challenges persist. Our results emphasize the pivotal role of VOCs management, providing policymakers with insights for adaptable and efficient measures.

AB  - The importance of biomass energy and the challenges of the sector in Sub-Saharan Africa has for a long time been the subject of considerable research. Unfortunately, the results of this work remain scattered and fragmented. This study aims to assess the current state of knowledge on the use and production of bioenergy in sub-Saharan Africa in order to guide the actors involved in the modernization process. The study is based on a cross-analysis of scientific publications on bioenergy for this region. The publications obtained are divided into predefined thematics, year of publication and geographical origin of the research centers. Statistical processing, especially Principal Component Analysis was carried out to establish a link between the countries of the research centers and the addressed thematic. The results showed that 2009 is a pivotal year for research in the field of bioenergy in Sub-Saharan Africa. France has been identified as the country most involved in research into the development of bioenergy in the region. Despite modernization efforts, the production and use of biomass for energy purposes in Sub-Saharan Africa remains traditional. However, the study reveals that apart from wood which is becoming scarce, Sub-Saharan Africa has many biomass ressources with high energy potential which can significantly contribute to satisfying local energy needs. Unfortunately, their valorization into modern renewable energy remains embryonic. The challenges to be met are 40 % technological, 32 % land-related and 28 % socio-political. A replicable bioenergy modernization assessment tool baptized "3P concept" based on nine objective criteria is developed.

AB  - In the United States, both scholars and practitioners have repeatedly emphasized the importance of "issue framing" for garnering public support for climate change policy. However, the debate frequently overlooks the importance of counter frames. For every framing attempt by advocates of climate policy, there will be a counter frame by the opponents of climate policy. How do counter frames influence the effectiveness of issue framing as a communication strategy? To answer this question, we report results from a survey experiment on a nationally representative sample of 1000 Americans on clean energy policy, a key policy issue in the public debate on climate change in the United States. Overall, we find that different combinations of positive and negative frames have remarkably little effect on support for clean energy policy. A follow-up on-line survey experiment with a convenience sample of 2000 Americans suggests that the counter frames are responsible for undermining the effects of the original frames.

AB  - PurposeThe increasing demand for fashion-augmented reality (FAR) in online fast fashion shopping has the potential to reduce soil and water pollution. Hence, it is vital to understand the success factors that influence consumers' intention to use FAR (IAR) and actual usage of FAR (UAR) to enhance its adoption.Design/methodology/approachBy incorporating the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, this study examined the influence of success factors on IAR, the effect of IAR on UAR and the mediating role of IAR in the relationship between success factors and UAR. In total, 803 responses were collected from Indonesia using a cross-sectional approach. Data were examined using partial least squares structural equation modelling.FindingsTheir findings revealed that perceived enjoyment, perceived service value and facilitating conditions significantly influenced IAR and UAR. However, the impacts of perceived functional benefits, lifestyle compatibility and perceived trust were insignificant. Nevertheless, the IAR has a significant influence on UAR. Finally, the IAR mediates the relationships among perceived enjoyment, perceived service value, facilitating conditions and UAR.Research limitations/implicationsThis study provides valuable insights for practitioners to develop marketing strategies and improve consumer perceptions of FAR, particularly in emerging economies. One limitation of this study is that it exclusively examined young consumers and restricted the examination to specific aspects of consumer behaviour.Originality/valueIntegrating the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology and partial least squares structural equation modelling provides a comprehensive understanding of the underlying dynamics and sheds light on the success factors that drive consumer IAR into UAR and contribute to Sustainable Development Goal 12 by reducing soil and water pollution.

AB  - Carbon capture, utilisation and storage has been recognised as a necessary measure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. CO(2 )shipping represents a promising transportation option that offers flexible sink-source matching to enable decarbonisation at a global scale. In order to implement safe and reliable loading and offloading operations at the terminal, marine loading arms require the integration of emergency release systems in the event of sudden movement of the ship away from the berthing line. In this study, a cryogenic test facility was constructed to handle CO2 in proximity of the triple point (~0.9 MPa[abs] - 1.7 MPa[abs], 227 K -239 K) and replicate the principles of an emergency release coupler during a shutdown, with the aim of investigating the CO(2 )discharge and dispersion behaviour, and determining the implications on coupler design and safety protocols. Findings show that separation of the test vessel leads to an abrupt discharge of the liquefied CO(2 )inventory and several phase transitions within 0.6 s of the start of the discharge in all tests. The clouds disperse in a 'tulip' shape that could be clearly observed from afar, and generation of carbon dioxide solids was observed on the vessel surface in all performed tests, bringing the temperature inside the vessel to approximately 190 K. The implementation of protective barriers is expected to reduce the impact of the release, though the risk of asphyxiation or cryogenic burns to surrounding personnel cannot be ruled out given the magnitude of the discharge process.

AB  - As transit authorities increasingly adopt electric buses (EBs) to mitigate air quality concerns and greenhouse gas emissions, new challenges arise in bus scheduling and timetabling. Unlike traditional buses, EBs face operational obstacles due to their shorter range and extended charging times. Existing mathematical optimization models for operation planning of traditional buses must be revised to address these unique characteristics of EBs. This study introduces a new approach to integrate timetabling and bus scheduling to enhance the level of service and minimize operational costs, using a case study of a University shuttle bus service in Montreal, Canada. The level of service will be enhanced by reducing students waiting time and improving their in-vehicle comfort through seat availability. The scheduling aspect seeks to reduce the total operational costs, which include travel, electricity consumption, and usage costs of EBs. The proposed algorithm calculates the waiting time and seat availability for different headway values and addresses the scheduling problem using a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model with an arc-based approach, solved using the Cplex Optimization Studio software version 12.8. A normalized weighted sum technique is then applied to select the optimal headway, balancing waiting time, seat availability, and operational costs. The effectiveness of our approach was tested through a case study of Concordia University's shuttle bus service. Comparative analysis of the current and proposed schedules shows that our approach significantly improves service quality by decreasing waiting times and increasing seat availability while optimizing cost-effectiveness compared to the existing timetable of the Concordia shuttle bus. The proposed approach ensures a smooth transition to a fully electric transit system for shuttle bus services.

AB  - Geologic carbon storage (GCS) is a fundamental pillar of carbon management that helps mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and addresses the negative effects of climate change. Viable CO2 storage sites share some of the same elements required for successful petroleum systems. For example, while reservoir, seal, and trap are required, migration pathway and timing are not important for CO2 storage, because rather than withdrawing fluid from a trap, CO2 storage involves injection into a geologic trap. Conceptually, this represents a form of reverse production. Numerous petroleum traps around the world, as well as naturally occurring CO2-producing fields and natural gas storage sites attest that safe, long-term storage is possible. Research over the past two decades identified five methods of Geologic Carbon Storage which have been validated through several demonstration and pilot projects around the world: (1) storage in depleted oil and gas fields, (2) use of CO2 in enhanced hydrocarbons recovery (3) storage in saline formations/aquifers, (4) injection into deep unmineable coal seams, and (5) in-situ/ex-situ carbon mineralization. The greatest volumetric potential for GCS is found in saline aquifers which are present throughout the world's sedimentary basins.

AB  - Using novel Fourier-based approaches, this paper investigates the effect of green logistics and financial innovation on environmental sustainability in China over the period 2000/Q1-2018/Q4. The Fourier ADL cointegration analysis indicates that all indicators are integrated. Additionally, the findings of the Fourier-ARDL long run indicate as follows: (i) Green logistics mitigate environmental degradation and increase environmental sustainability in China; (ii) in contrast, the impact of financial innovation and economic growth decreases the environmental quality and increases production-based CO2 emissions in the region. The research findings offer valuable insights for policymakers, providing a basis for adopting green logistics operations that promote sustainable practices in China. By implementing such practices, policymakers can mitigate the adverse impacts of economic and financial activities in the country, fostering sustainable development and environmental responsibility.

AB  - The recent past has seen the proposal of multiple 'Green New Deals' across geographies as a means to fight against the climate crisis and ecological breakdown. Of these, the European Green Deal- EGD represents the world's first public commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions of at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. Because the EGD plans to "transform the EU," in this paper we examine how it fits within a historical continuum of colonial and neo-colonial relations. We argue that the EGD is the latest discursive strategy for the 'greening' of empire through four registers: (1) turning ecological crises into profitable opportunities; (2) portraying the EU as a 'moral' intervener; (3) building on a 'green' "will to improve"; and (4) securitizing and consolidating the empire. We find how the EU acts in key policy arenas of diplomacy, trade and investment leading to the 'greening' of the empire that ensures its continued economic and political leadership while fundamentally maintaining a status quo. We conclude with some reflections on the role of the EU to cede place to other possibilities of building anti-colonial ecologies.

AB  - Microbial metabolism of the thawing organic carbon stores in permafrost results in a positive feedback loop of greenhouse gas emissions. CO2 and CH4 fluxes and the associated microbial communities in Arctic cryosols are important in predicting future warming potential of the Arctic. We demonstrate that topography had an impact on CH4 and CO2 flux at a high Arctic ice-wedge polygon terrain site, with higher CO2 emissions and lower CH4 uptake at troughs compared to polygon interior soils. The pmoA sequencing suggested that USC alpha cluster of uncultured methanotrophs is likely responsible for observed methane sink. Community profiling revealed distinct assemblages across the terrain at different depths. Deeper soils contained higher abundances of Verrucomicrobia and Gemmatimonadetes, whereas the polygon interior had higher Acidobacteria and lower Betaproteobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria abundances. Genome sequencing of isolates from the terrain revealed presence of carbon cycling genes including ones involved in serine and ribulose monophosphate pathways. A novel hybrid network analysis identified key members that had positive and negative impacts on other species. Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) with numerous positive interactions corresponded to Proteobacteria, Candidatus Rokubacteria and Actinobacteria phyla, while Verrucomicrobia and Acidobacteria members had negative impacts on other species. Results indicate that topography and microbial interactions impact community composition.

AB  - In the last years, the landscape of anti-aging cosmetics has been marked by significant advances in cosmeceutical delivery systems. This study aimed to conduct a systematic review of these technological innovations, with a focus on anti-aging effects, from 2018 to 2023. The methodology included a thorough search on PubMed and through gray literature, applying rigorous exclusion criteria. The descriptors were selected based on the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). A total of 265 articles were found. Exclusion criteria were applied, and 90 of them were selected for full reading. After reading the full 90 articles, 52 were excluded, leaving 38 articles for final evaluation composing this review. The key findings highlighted a clear prevalence of studies exploring nanotechnology, including nanoparticles, niosomes, and liposomes. Most of the formulations analyzed in this review emphasize antioxidant activities, which play a crucial role in preventing premature aging caused by free radicals. The reviewed studies revealed specific activities, such as the reduction in melanin synthesis, the inhibition of enzymes involved in the skin aging process, and the prevention of morphological changes typical of aging.

AB  - Climate change has direct and indirect consequences for the military and defence sector. Direct impacts are for example the damaging of military infrastructure due to more extreme climatic conditions or the impact on operational capabilities when on missions. Indirect impacts include the increase of global instability and insecurity, or migration due to changing climatic conditions. Climate change risks are often seen as a threat multiplier. Whilst the impacts of climate change on the military and defence sector is gaining attention in both political and scientific realms, the way this sector adapts to these risks is, however, still pretty much unknown. This research aims to assess how the European Union member states' military and defence sector are adapting to the impacts of climate change. We map and analyse the current policy actions by analysing the defence and climate policy documents (n = 63) and conducting interviews (n = 8) with civil servants of defence ministries across the EU. We find that almost none of the countries have a concrete climate change adaptation plan for their military. Whilst several frontrunner countries do mention climate change in their defence policy documents, they lack concrete policy goals and instruments. Moreover, concrete adaptation measures are not discussed by most of the countries. France is a notable exemption as it offers more detailed policies, but they too are at the groundwork stage. Hardly any reference to the military was found in the climate policy documents of the countries. The results show that the military and defence sector of the EU member states are not well prepared to the impacts of climate change and that concerted action is needed to close the adaptation gap adequately and effectively.

AB  - Background: The epidemiological evidence linking socioeconomic deprivation with adverse pregnancy outcomes has been conflicting mainly due to poor measurement of socioeconomic status (SES). Studies have also failed to evaluate the plausible pathways through which socioeconomic disadvantage impacts on pregnancy outcomes. We investigated the importance of maternal SES as determinant of birth weight and gestational duration in an urban area and evaluated main causal pathways for the influence of SES. Methods: A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 559 mothers accessing postnatal services at the four main health facilities in Cape Coast, Ghana in 2011. Information on socioeconomic characteristics of the mothers was collected in a structured questionnaire. Results: In multivariate linear regression adjusting for maternal age, parity and gender of newborn, low SES resulted in 292 g (95% CI: 440-145) reduction in birth weight. Important SES-related determinants were neighborhood poverty (221 g; 95% CI: 355-87), low education (187 g; 95% CI: 355-20), studentship during pregnancy (291 g; 95% CI: 506-76) and low income (147 g; 95% CI: 277-17). In causal pathway analysis, malaria infection (6-20%), poor nutrition (2-51%) and indoor air pollution (10-62%) mediated substantial proportions of the observed effects of socioeconomic deprivation on birth weight. Generalized linear models adjusting for confounders indicated a 218% (RR: 3.18; 95% CI: 1.41-7.21) risk increase of LBW and 83% (RR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.31-2.56) of PTB among low income mothers. Low and middle SES was associated with 357% (RR: 4.57; 95% CI: 1.67-12.49) and 278% (RR: 3.78; 95% CI: 1.39-10.27) increased risk of LBW respectively. Malaria infection, poor nutrition and indoor air pollution respectively mediated 10-21%, 16-44% and 31-52% of the observed effects of socioeconomic disadvantage on LBW risk. Conclusion: We provide evidence of the effects of socioeconomic deprivation, substantially mediated by malaria infection, poor nutrition and indoor air pollution, on pregnancy outcomes in a developing country setting.

AB  - Because a significant portion of the American electorate identify themselves as evangelical Christians, the evangelical position on climate policy is important to determining the role the United States could play in global climate cooperation. Do evangelicals oppose all climate policies, or are they particularly opposed to certain types of policies? We argue that American evangelicals oppose climate policy due to their distrust of international cooperation and institutions, which has been a prominent feature of evangelical politics since the beginning of the Cold War. Using data from the 2011 Faith and Global Policy Challenges survey and the 2010 Chicago Council Global View survey, we find support for the theory. Evangelicals are equally likely to support domestic climate policy as other Americans, but they are significantly less likely to support international treaties on climate cooperation. The findings suggest that proponents of climate policy could win more evangelicals to their side by focusing on domestic action, instead of multilateral negotiations or international institutions.

AB  - Thermoelectric devices convert heat to electricity without greenhouse gas emissions and have the potential to serve as energy sources in wearable devices. Ongoing efforts are focused on designing materials that offer both high conversion efficiency and mechanical flexibility. Half-Heusler materials, such as TiNiSn, exhibit promising chemical stability and thermoelectric efficiency, but their inherent brittleness poses challenges for applications in flexible devices. Here, TiNiSn thin films were deposited by DC magnetron sputtering at room temperature to investigate their response to bending for flexible devices applications. Therefore, different substrates were considered: Si, Kapton, silk, and printer paper, whereas Si was used as a reference. The composition and structure of the deposited thin films were analyzed by employing energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and wide-angle X-ray scattering, respectively. The film morphology was examined via scanning electron microscopy. Additionally, density functional theory (DFT) was employed to explore interfaces between the flexible substrates and amorphous TiNiSn and calculate the Cauchy pressure, a key indicator of ductile/brittle behavior. Amorphous TiNiSn thin film exhibits good adhesion to flexible Kapton, silk, and paper substrates. Mechanical loading, namely bending up to 154 degrees, was applied to assess crack formation, revealing only a few cracks at 78 degrees and 154 degrees, thus indicating a certain level of flexibility. DFT data support these findings, showing intermediate adhesion strength between amorphous TiNiSn and monomers from the flexible substrates. The calculated Cauchy pressure of 30 GPa suggests the ductility of TiNiSn in the amorphous state. Therefore, replacing alternative time-consuming synthesis methods, eliminating the demand for high temperatures, and providing a nontoxic and cost-effective material with good adhesion to various substrates are reasons why amorphous TiNiSn thin film emerges as a good candidate for flexible thermoelectric devices.

AB  - The booming development of the aluminum industry has greatly contributed to China's economic development, but it also imposed a burden on the environment. Recent technological development has emerged various methods for aluminum production to improve production efficiency and reduce environmental impacts, while reducing energy intensity in traditional production practices can also lower emissions and remain low production costs. However, which approach that performs better in achieving economic benefits and reducing environ-mental impacts is unclear. This study analyzed six major aluminum production methods based on alumina production process and energy mix. Environmental parameters were derived based on life cycle assessment, and economic cost parameters were formed by building an economic benefits model. This paper then analyzed the potential of achieving economic benefits and environmental impacts reduction for each method using life cycle assessment and principal component analysis. Finally, the greenhouse gas emissions from the aluminum industry in 2030 based on scenario analysis was analyzed. We found that Bayer process-hydropower method performs the best in reducing environmental impacts and achieving economic benefits, while the sinter process-thermal power method performs the worst. The effect of reducing emissions by changing the energy mix (75%) was more significant than that by changing the alumina production process (up to 10%). Furthermore, we used scenario analysis to expand the capacity share of the Bayer process-hydropower method with optimal comprehensive benefit increased by 22.2%, the cost of electricity decreased by 313.77 CNY/t-Al, and the global warming po-tential was reduced by nearly 1/3. Thus, our results reveal the significant benefits of the Chinese government's push to increase the share of clean energy applications in the aluminum industry.

AB  - Sustainable consumption and production have been increasingly required in the construction industry. However, previous studies have not yet comprehensively developed evaluation tools and methods to implement sustainable consumption and production. To achieve this objective, we utilized the eco-innovation, which provides effective analysis of sustainable consumption and production for the construction firms by eliminating subjectivity and ambiguity of evaluations. We adopted the fuzzy set theory to overcome the uncertainty occurring from the judgments of experts and utilized decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory approach to analyse the causal relationships between our methods and evaluation criteria. The results showed that environment and sustainable consumption are the key factors, while life cycle assessment, eco-labels, and environmental certification as well as improving eco-efficiency are critical to realizing sustainable consumption and production. The study enhances the understanding of the major players to achieve sustainable consumption and production, and link sustainable consumption and production with the eco-innovative practices. Our approach also improves the assessment accuracy, and the results provide viable suggestions for practical applications.

AB  - Carbon credit projects generate carbon credits by abating greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon credits can then be traded on carbon markets or immobilized in order to compensate for caused emissions. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), as the two most important carbon credit mechanisms, are investigated and compared regarding the success of projects. We define success as the fulfilling of the ex-ante emission abatement estimation and apply regression analyses to explain its variation on a project level by technology, location, scale, duration and participation. The results are discussed in detail on technology level for wind power, energy efficiency, hydro power as well as biomass projects and are compared with regard to CDM and VCS. Our main results indicate that large scale projects often compensate for their under-performance due to economies of time. Furthermore, the duration of projects, their location and structure of participants have significant influence on the success of the projects. The sign of the coefficients of explanatory variables are broadly in line with intuition and related literature, although, due to data availability, they are not always highly significant statistically.

AB  - Buildings are complex assets, characterized by environments and uses that change over time, variable occupancies, and long life cycles. They have high operational costs, mostly due to their energy requirements, and account for 30% to 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, substantial effort has been made to forecast their energy needs, with the scope of optimizing their economic and environmental impact. In this regard, the available literature focuses mainly on short-term modeling through the implementation of sets of physics-based equations (i.e., white-box), functional relationships between input and output variables (i.e., black-box), or a combination of both (i.e., grey-box). On the other hand, more research is required on long-term forecast models with the aim of reducing the energy needs. Within this context, this article presents an original automatic procedure for forecasting the energy needs of buildings in short- and long-term time horizons. This is accomplished by scaling an unknown facility from a similar facility that is already known and by executing a black-box approach based on machine learning algorithms. The proposed method is implemented in real case studies in Italy, predicting the energy needs (i.e., heating, cooling, and electricity) of Sant'Anna Hospital in Ferrara using the historical data of Ca' Foncello Hospital in Treviso. The results show an adjusted coefficient of determination above 0.7 and an average error below 10% for all the energy vectors, demonstrating a feasible forecast performance with a low training set-to-test set ratio.

AB  - Forest plays an important role in reducing pressure on the natural environment, weaking the influence of greenhouse effects, and sequestrating atmospheric carbon dioxide. So far, due to the lack of complete understanding of forest ecosystem processes and the limitations on the scope of application of evaluation methods, there are still great uncertainties in the researches on carbon fluxes of forest ecosystems in China at the national level. En this study, an individual tree species FORCCHN model, which could flexibly use the inventory data as the initial field (more accurately) or use the remote sensing information to inverse initial field was applied. The dynamics of key carbon cycle fluxes (net primary productivity (NPP) and net ecosystem productivity (NEP)) and carbon sequestration of forest ecosystems in China from 1982 to 2019 were simulated based on remote sensing data and FORCCI IN model. The results showed that forest ecosystems in China had great carbon sequestration potential over the past 39 years. From 1982 to 2019, the NPP of Chinese forests presented a fluctuated increase. Total NPP from 2011 to 2019 ranged from 0.91 PgC.a(-1) to 1.14 PgC.a(-1). Annual average NEP of forest ecosystems in China from 2011 to 2019 was 0.199 PgC.a(-1 )(1Pg = 10(15) g). Influenced by climate, soil and vegetation, carbon sequestration potential in Chinese forest ecosystems presented obvious regional differences in space. The spatial distribution of NEP gradually increased from Northwest to Southeast China. From 2011 to 2019, forests in Yunnan Province had the strongest carbon storage capacity (72.79 TgC.a(-1) Tg = 10(12) g), followed by forests in Guangxi (18.49 TgC.a(-1)) and forests in Guangdong (10.01 TgC.a(-1)). Our results not only address concerns about carbon sequestration but also reflect the importance of Chinese forest resources in the development of the national economy and society.

AB  - Tourism is an economic activity that results in a wide range of environmental impacts. The contribution of tourism to human-induced climate change is an increasingly important issue. However, the energy use and greenhouse gas emissions from tourism products have never been thoroughly discussed. This study uses life cycle assessment (LCA) to explore energy use and CO2 emissions of island tourism and then compare the environmental loads of different tourism subsectors. This study uses three Taiwanese islands (Penghu, Kinmen, and Green islands) as examples to examine the LCA approach, and it calculates and compares the energy usage and CO2 emissions of the transportation, accommodation, and recreation activity sectors. Results show that each tourist consumes 502, 447, and 118 MJ of energy per day on Penghu, Kinmen, and Green islands, respectively. Each tourist also generates 34.0, 27.9, and 7.1 kg of CO2 emissions on Penghu, Kinmen, and Green islands, respectively. Each Penghu tourist per day consumes 4.25 times as much energy as each Green tourist, and each Penghu tourist generates 4.7 times the CO2 emissions as each Green tourist. In summary, the transportation sector generates the largest energy (4967%) and the largest proportion of CO2 emissions (5872.4%); the airplane sector is the primary contributor. Finally, this study discuses the advantages and limitations of the LCA approach. (c) 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 2011

AB  - The petroleum refining industry plays a very important role in international economics and in our daily life. The world refining capacity has increased rapidly during the past decade, and this makes operation planning, scheduling, and general optimization become important tools for the refinery industry. However, environmental regulations and risks of climate change are pressuring the refinery industry to minimize its greenhouse gas emissions. In this research, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is proposed for the production planning of refinery processes to achieve maximum operational profit while reducing CO2 emissions to a given target through the use of different CO2 mitigation options. The options considered in this study are flow-rate balancing (decreasing the inlet flow rate to a unit that emits more CO2) fuel switching (changes in a certain operation to run with a different fuel that emits less CO2 emissions, such as natural gas), and installation of a CO2 capture process (e.g., the monoethanolamine (MEA) process). The objective of the MINLP model is to determine suitable CO2 mitigation options for a given reduction target while meeting the demand of each final product and its quality specifications, while simultaneously maximizing profit. In this study, a Global optimization algorithm is used on the different case studies considered.

AB  - An Enhanced-Internet network that provides ultra-low-latency guaranteed-rate (GR) communications for Cloud Services is proposed. The network supports two traffic classes, the Smooth and Best-Effort classes. Smooth traffic flows receive low-jitter GR service over virtual-circuit-switched (VCS) connections with negligible buffering and queueing delays, up to 100% link utilizations, deterministic end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees, and improved energy efficiency. End-to-end delays are effectively reduced to the fiber "time of flight." A new router scheduling problem called the Bounded Normalized-Jitter integer-programming problem is formulated. A fast polynomial-time approximate solution is presented, allowing TDM-based router schedules to be computed in microseconds. We establish that all admissible traffic demands in any packet-switched network can be simultaneously satisfied with GR-VCS connections, with minimal buffering. Each router can use two periodic TDM-based schedules to support GR-VCS connections, which are updated automatically when the router's traffic rate matrix changes. The design of a Silicon-Photonics all-optical packet switch with minimal buffering is presented. The Enhanced-Internet can: 1) reduce router buffer requirements by factors of; 2) increase the Internet's aggregate capacity; 3) lower the Internet's capital and operating costs; and 4) lower greenhouse gas emissions through improved energy efficiency.

AB  - Mainstream life cycle assessment (LCA) studies on the climate change impact of bioenergy fail to account for some direct impacts, such as biomass-derived CO2 emissions and potential impacts on future carbon dynamics. For a more persuasive assessment of the climate change impacts of bioenergy, a simplified and comprehensive framework was developed for LCA by integrating the atmospheric carbon cycle model, plant growth model, and biomass decomposition model. The system includes four components: fossil fuel-derived greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, biogenic CO2 emissions, biomass regrowth for compensation, and the difference in carbon sequestration from the reference scenario. For an illustration purpose, the framework was applied in the study of the climate change impacts of hybrid poplar use for bio-ethanol, bio-diesel, heating, and bio-power. The LCA study indicated that the fossil fuel-derived GHG emissions (15.77-42.55 kg CO2 eq/GJ) from biomass utilization were lower than those from the combustion of fossil fuels. Because the fossil fuel-derived GHG emissions, biogenic CO2 emissions, and biomass regrowth for compensation were positive, the sums of the three components (120.21-243.97 kg CO2 eq/GJ) were higher than the emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels. However, biomass utilization may improve biomass regrowth or avoid biomass decomposition. The differences in carbon sequestration are usually negative and can offset the positive climate change impacts. The final total climate change impacts for the different types of bioenergy were from -26.85 kg CO2 eq/GJ to 1.08 kg CO2 eq/GJ. The newly developed framework is more persuasive and comprehensive than the conventional LCA because it includes all the direct impacts of biomass utilization based on the biomass characteristics. The application of this framework can ensure the sustainable utilization of biomass and avoid ecosystem degradation.

AB  - Background: We analyse Gordon's trade-off by adapting Thurow's approach of pure public good using the example of the German energy sector which is in a transition process to a low-carbon sustainable energy system (Energiewende). The income distribution and the energy expenditures of households are interpreted as public goods. Their distribution is measured with the Atkinson index, which determines how the quality of life, as measured in income and energy expenditures, is distributed among society. Methods: We use the disaggregated consumption and income for 39.409 million German households. Our socioeconomic analysis focuses on six household types. Results: Our analysis shows that among German households, energy expenditures are more equally distributed than private consumption in general and income. The rather (but by far not completely) equal distribution of energy expenditures confirms Smil's finding that energy is the universal currency (Sen, On Economic Inequality, 1973) for people's welfare and can be seen as an indicator of the basic needs of households irrespective of household income. Nevertheless, low-income households have to spend a higher share of their income on energy to avoid energy poverty. Further price increases could lead to an unequal distribution and rising energy poverty. Conclusions: The socio-economic conditions of society and its energy sector have to be addressed in a transition processes. Energy poverty constitutes an infringement of the sustainability concept. If society does not take distributional effects into account, the transition process itself could be jeopardized.

AB  - Eliminating poverty, reducing inequality, and achieving balanced development are one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Objectively and accurately measuring regional economic vitality and development equilibrium is a pressing scientific issue that needs to be addressed in order to achieve common prosperity. Nighttime light (NTL) remote sensing data have been proven to be a good proxy variable for socio-economic development, and are widely used due to their advantages of convenient access and wide spatial coverage. Based on multi-source data, this study constructs an Economic Development Index (EDI) that comprehensively reflects regional economic vitality from two aspects, economic quality and development potential, combines the Nighttime Light Development Index (NLDI) as the evaluation indicators to measure the economic vitality and development equilibrium, analyzes the economic vitality and development equilibrium of 300 district and county units in China's three major urban agglomerations from 2000 to 2020 and their temporal and spatial variation characteristics, and discusses the connotation of EDI and its availability. The results show the following: (1) From 2000 to 2020, the average growth rate of EDI in China's three major urban agglomerations reached 36.32%, while the average decrease rate of NLDI reached 38.75%; both economic vitality and the development equilibrium have been continuously enhanced. Among them, the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) urban agglomeration experienced the fastest economic growth, while the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) exhibited the strongest economic strength. (2) Both economic vitality and the development equilibrium in these three urban agglomerations exhibited distinct spatial agglomeration characteristics, namely center-surrounding distribution, coastal-inland distribution, and radial belt-pole distribution, respectively. (3) Over the past two decades, the economic development of these three urban agglomerations has progressed towards the pattern of regional coordinated development, pole-driven development and urban-rural integrated development. The research results can provide new research perspectives and scientific support for promoting regional balanced development, achieving sustainable development goals, and reducing inequality.

AB  - Gasification of biomass ultimately generates at least one solid byproduct in which the inorganic constituents of the biomass are concentrated. Given the potential for utilization, or issues with disposal, facile methods are needed for determining the compositions of the fly ashes from recently-available gasifier-based bioenergy systems. Proton induced x-ray emission spectroscopy (PIXE) and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) were used to characterize the fly ash recovered from a pilot-scale (25 kW) modular bioenergy system operated with wood chips as the feedstock. The composition of the fly ash from the downdraft gasifier showed some similarities to compositions reported for boiler wood ashes, apart from one half of the material being unburned carbon. Although ICP-AES showed greater sensitivity for the analysis of the fly ash, especially for small amounts of heavy metal contaminants, PIXE proved to be a powerful analytical tool for screening of elements from sodium to uranium. Such broad spectrum screenings could prevent the inadvertent land application of unsuspected pollutant elements. Fly ashes from biomass gasification appear to be suitable for use as ash-based fertilizers for forest lands; however, combustion to remove unburned carbon may be advisable.

AB  - IntroductionThe ecological conservation redline (ECR) policies conducted in China are an important innovation to protect biodiversity, safeguard ecological security, and achieve sustainable development. The Pearl River Delta (PRD) area implemented the ECR policies in 2005. MethodsThis study examines the contrast between the 15 years before and after 2005. It also reveals the ECR policies' effects by comparing land use change, landscape pattern index, and habitat quality inside (IECR) and outside (OECR) the ECR area. Results and discussionThe results suggest that: (1) The ECR area has served as an ecological barrier in maintaining the stability of natural ecosystems. Over the past 30 years, the PRD area significantly changed land use types and ecosystems, mainly concentrated in the central plains and estuaries. Specifically, in the IECR, land use change was relatively stable, with a decrease of 0.05% and 0.57% in ecological land and an increase of 0.28% and 0.68% in construction land before and after 2005. In contrast, the OECR area land use changed dramatically, with a decrease of 0.37% and 1.36% in ecological land and an increase of 7.06% and 5.02% in construction land before and after 2005. (2) A general trend of landscape fragmentation exists in the study area. The contagion (CONTAG) in the IECR area is higher than in the OECR. The Shannon's diversity index (SHDI) in the IECR is lower than in the OECR area, which indicates a high degree and rapid landscape fragmentation in the OECR area. (3) Over 85% of the IECR scale had a habitat quality of 0.8-1, while the OECR area had an almost half scale with a habitat quality of 0-0.2. On the whole, the ecological stability and landscape connectivity of in the IECR area was higher than that of the OECR area. This indicates that the prohibitions on human disturbance, industrial construction, and logging activities in the IECR area allow green vegetation to succumb under natural conditions. Habitat quality in the IECR area was also higher than that of the OECR area in the PRD area, revealing that the quality of green development in the IECR area was higher. Finally, the ECR policies' implementation has protected the environment in the PRD area and will provide experience for ecological conservation in other areas.

AB  - Environmental problems are a function of the process of economic development and the ability to mitigate the problems through regulation. An historical analysis helps to show how the problems have been solved thus far. The objective of this investigation is to present an overview of environmental problems and the corresponding regulations in Western Europe during the 1980s. Environmental problems for 18 Western European countries were identified from abstracts from a data base on environmental literature. The 1977 findings were systematized on the basis of 20 key words according to source and impact, and a new data base was established. The data showed that the main environmental problems in Western Europe were: energy production/acid rain, nuclear power/waste, air pollution/climate, heavy metals, pesticides, water pollution, solid waste, and unforeseen accidents. Many environmental problems are common to most European countries. Regulatory measures differ significantly. In some countries environmental regulations are largely limited to the implementation of European Economic Community (EEC) directives. We have supplemented the national analyses with an examination of existing and proposed EEC regulations along with interviews with civil servants in the EEC Commission. In the 1980s, EEC environmental regulations were similar to environmental regulations in some member states. It is expected that future EEC regulations will be less reflective of those of individual member states.

AB  - A new area of research and intervention has arisen, namely the psychology of sustainability. Therefore, this study investigates how an undergraduate student teacher's psychological traits, their psychological state, their situation, and environmental education affect their sustainable consumption behavior. Two sample groups were selected from ten Thai university education programs' science (n = 400) and social science (n = 400) colleges nationwide. The research instrument used randomized multistage questionnaires for each group, which used a five-level scale to evaluate each student teacher's item agreement. The analysis of the causal relationship models used LISREL 9.10 which determined that both models and their four causal variables positively affected a Thai student teacher's sustainable consumption behavior (SCB). For the science education student teachers, these were the situation (SIT = 0.87), environmental education (EDU = 0.34), their psychological state (STATE = 0.22), and their psychological traits (TRAITS = 0.22). For the social science education student teachers, these were SIT = 0.85, STATE = 0.25, EDU = 0.08, and TRAITS = 0.04. Combined, they can explain 92% (science program) and 82% (social science program) of variance in a student teacher's SCB. The study also determined that EDU's attitude and conservation factors were critical, which most probably increased in prominence due to media awareness efforts. There also appears to be greater individual responsibility in SCB as well as the perceived need to conserve resources. Finally, this study further confirmed numerous other studies in which humans have a strong desire to fit in and will conform to the behavior of those around them, with this study concluding that each student teacher's situation was determined to have a moderate to strong influence on either their psychological state or environmental education. This study contributed to the literature as it investigated 18 aspects related to four casual variables affecting a Thai student teacher's sustainable consumption behavior. The study was unique in that it classified and compared opinions from two diverse university teaching programs nationwide (Science and Social Science), whose results can help educational leaders identify and develop in-depth, SCB future programs.

Such activities are overdue and should be welcomed, but the lack of skills and support available to interpret and use the results represents a danger. The introduction of new diagnostic methods, particularly liquid culture, should be carefully structured according to the local situation, failing which frustration and the disruption of previously underdeveloped but adequately functioning laboratories may result.

AB  - Distributed power grid integration contributes to both the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the protection of the environment. Nevertheless, the uncertainty and volatility associated with the production of clean renewable energy adds additional challenges to microgrid dispatch. The paper presents an adaptive mutant bird swarm algorithm and suggests a comparison mechanism based on population fitness variances and optimal values in order to overcome the shortcomings of BSA, in particular its tendency to self-correct into local optimum and slow convergence speed. First, the algorithm determines if the population is in the local optimal state. The local optimal individual is then subjected to Cauchy mutation in order to determine the optimal value again. This improves the accuracy and speed of the BSA. Based on simulation results, the improved algorithm has higher optimization accuracy and faster optimization speed, which demonstrates the effectiveness and advancement of the algorithm proposed in this research.

AB  - Climate change is one of the major problems of the planet. The atmosphere is overloaded with carbon dioxide caused by fossil fuels that are burned for energy. Almost 40 percent of the total energy worldwide is used by the building sector, which comes from non-renewable sources and contributes up to 30% of annual greenhouse gas emissions globally. The building sector in Iran accounts for 33.8% of Iran's total energy usage. Within the building sector, the energy consumption of Iranian educational buildings is 2.5 times higher than educational buildings in developed countries. One of the most effective ways of reducing global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions is retrofitting existing buildings. This study aims to investigate whether a particular energy-optimized design under the present climate conditions would respond effectively to future climate change. This can help designers make a better decision on an optimal model, which can remain optimal over the years based on climate change. For methodological purposes, multistage optimization was used to retrofit an existing educational building. Specifically, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) was chosen to minimize the cooling and heating load, as well as consider investment costs for present and future weather files, using the jEPlus tool. Furthermore, the TOPSIS method was used to identify the best set of retrofit measures. For this purpose, a four-story educational building in Tehran was modeled on Design Builder software v7.0.0.116 as a case study to provide a better understanding for researchers of how to effectively retrofit a building to achieve a nearly zero energy building considering climate change. The results show that the optimized solution for the present weather file does not remain the optimized solution in 2080. Moreover, it is shown that to have an optimized building in regard to future weather files, the model should be designed for the future weather conditions. This study shows that if the building becomes optimized using the present weather file the total energy consumption will be reduced by 65.14% and 86.18% if using the future weather file. These two figures are obtained by implementing active and passive measures and show the priority of using the future weather file for designers. Using PV panels also, this building is capable of becoming a nearly net zero building, which would produce about 90% of its own energy demands.

AB  - Colluvial deposits, as the correlate sediments of humaninduced soil erosion, depict an excellent archive of land use and landscape history as indicators of human-environment interactions. This study establishes a chronostratigraphy of colluvial deposits and reconstructs past land use dynamics in the Swabian Jura, the Baar and the Black Forest in SW Germany. In the agriculturally favourable Baar area multiple main phases of colluvial deposition, and thus intensified land use, can be identified from the Neolithic to the Modern times. In the unfavourable Swabian Jura increased colluvial deposition began later compared to the more favourable areas in the Baar. The same holds true for the unfavourable areas of the Black Forest, but intensified land use can only be reconstructed for the Middle Ages and Early Modern times instead of for the Bronze and Iron Age as in the Swabian Jura. Land use intensity and settlement dynamics represented by thick, multilayered colluvial deposits increase in the Baar and the Black Forest during the Middle Ages. In between those phases of geomorphodynamic activity and colluviation, stable phases occur, interpreted as phases with sustainable land use or without human presence.

AB  - Does it matter whether research is conducted by the private business rather than in universities or government research centres? While most of the attention of science and innovation policy in the last decades has explored the relevance of the interconnections between public and business players in enhancing knowledge-based societies, a major trend has been ignored: both the quota of public R & D and its share over the total R & D investment has shrunk in the majority of OECD countries. As a result, a larger fraction of knowledge is today generated in the business sector. We argue that this is a major problem since public research and private research differ along a number of characteristics, e.g. public access, potential for future technological innovations, criteria of resource allocation. This trend can have adverse implications for long-term innovation and economic welfare in our societies. Through the lens of the public goods theory and of the sector of funding and execution of R & D for the period 1981-2013 we try to explain why.

AB  - The rate of innovation in construction equipment is measured by using two variables over a 30-year period, 1962-92: The number of new models introduced every year and the technological life of eight earthmoving equipments are considered in this study. The findings indicate that the rate of innovation in the construction equipment industry increased in the 30-year study period. The findings also suggest that these innovations are incremental in nature, stimulated by technological advances in other industries, but primarily driven by market forces. Technological advances are not confined to the industry that produces innovations. The mapping of the interindustry flow of innovations highlights that while construction companies play a predominant role in generating their own technological innovations, they are also heavily dependent on other industries, such as the construction equipment industry for the flow of technical system innovations. As such, the continuous and incremental innovations in the construction equipment industry are bound to act as a catalyst for the generation of technological advances in the construction industry.

AB  - Advanced and emerging economies are becoming more interdependent with rapid pace of globalization of capital markets and technological innovations in recent years. We examine whether technology and monetary policy shocks get transmitted between advanced and emerging market economies and to what extent they generate complementary or competitive effects. Given the globally integrated nature of capital markets, we uncover a transmission mechanism by which technology and policy shocks in advanced and emerging countries spill over between them through the capital flow channel. We mainly investigate whether analysis from a SVAR model by econometricians provides empirically similar conclusions to those from a macroeconomic theory-based DSGE model in measuring the impact of demand-side policy and technology shocks. We fit our VAR models to the same time series data used to calibrate and estimate the DSGE model. We conclude that monetary and fiscal policy shocks are competitive between the US (advanced economy) and India (emerging market), while domestic and global technology shocks or the exchange rate shocks have complementary effects. Intuitively, technology enhances productivity in both countries, while policy shocks tend to drive capital to a country with higher rate of return. Thus policy shocks in advanced countries could have unintended effects in terms of capital inflows to emerging economies and hence greater coordination of policies can help limit adverse cross-border spillovers.

AB  - In South-Asian region, Auto-rickshaw (electric/engine driven) is a well-known vehicle. Mostly in India and Bangladesh, people prefer auto-rickshaw for traveling small to medium distances. However, no reliable study has been conducted using both solar and wind energy in auto-rickshaw. This paper is basically a research on using both solar and wind energy in engine driven auto-rickshaw along with a plugged-in hybrid technology. Placement of a wind turbine on the roof of the vehicle is not an effective idea. For this reason, a model of the vehicle is proposed for the placement of the turbine inside the vehicle and the model is validated by ANSYS CFX simulation. The theory and the simulation results match perfectly. From the analysis, it has been found that both the renewable energies will provide approximately 29.34% of the total power to run the vehicle altogether. The vehicle will not only reduce the pressure on national grid electricity but also reduce the greenhouse gas emissions by a large amount, if the conventional one is replaced by the proposed one. A custom drive cycle is also obtained using the vehicle properties and comparing with Asian Urban Drive Cycle. A novel CFD simulation is conducted for wind turbine blade considering reasonable data. Feasibility study of the proposed vehicle is also analyzed in this paper considering cost, weight and emission and a future recharging infrastructure is also proposed for running the vehicle on 100% green energy. Finally, this paper would help researchers for the further development of the combined system.

AB  - Global population growth drives fossil fuel usage, surpassing natural greenhouse gas emissions and causing climate change, higher temperatures, floods, and agricultural erosion. The study underscores the significance of appropriate material selection and meticulous building design to establish a healthy living environment and mitigate energy consumption. The research is dedicated to the reduction of CO2 emissions. Hospitals, due to their constant energy requirements, require optimal temperature and comfort management for patients, necessitating careful design to avoid disruptions and power outages. The principal objective of this research is to enhance energy efficiency in the design phase of hospital buildings in Turkey and to develop an energy-efficient hospital model. This objective is achieved by evaluating different insulation materials, building orientations, lighting efficiency, and window-to-wall ratios. The methodology involves creating a reference structure for energy load calculations using Revit software and utilizing the Green Building Studio (GBS) program to conduct energy analyses in 7 different cities across Turkey. The study found that the utilization of building parameters with renewable energy sources reduced energy consumption by 57.5%, total costs by 16.24%, and CO2 emissions by 26.3%. The fundamental contribution of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of reducing energy consumption, costs, and CO2 emissions through design adjustments. The novelty of this research lies in its comprehensive approach to optimizing energy efficiency and CO2 emissions in hospital buildings in Turkey. These findings underline the significance of energy-efficient design, particularly considering the impact of increased energy usage and CO2 emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Spatially fractionated radiotherapy (SFRT) techniques have undergone transformative evolution, encompassing physical GRID therapy, MLC-based grids, virtual TOMO GRIDs, and 3-dimensional high-dose lattices. Historical roots trace back to Alban K & ouml;hler's pioneering Spatially fractionated grid therapy (SFGRT), utilizing physical grids for dose modulation. Technological innovations introduced multi-leaf collimators (MLCs), enabling adaptable spatial fractionation and a shift to the broader term "SFRT." Physics and dosimetry-based studies have demonstrated the feasibility of computerized treatment planning and identified the potential to minimize the peripheral dose while using such high-dose therapy. Meanwhile, 3-dimensional high-dose lattices showed enhanced precision. The meticulous placement of high-dose volumetric spheres enables a reduction in the volume of high-dose spills. Advancements in 3-dimensional lattices through intensity-modulated radiotherapy and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) techniques offer enhanced therapeutic options. A database of SFRT studies identified 723 articles. This review shows the trajectory of SFRT from traditional grids to MLC-based approaches, virtual TOMO GRIDs, and innovative 3-dimensional lattices. Technological innovations, dosimetric advancements, and clinical feasibility have underscored the continual progress in refining spatially fractionated radiotherapy. The integration of MLCs and lattice techniques has demonstrated improved therapeutic outcomes, solidifying their relevance in modern radiation therapy protocols. Research has yet to reveal a clear correlation between treatment outcomes and dosimetric parameters. Additional investigations are necessary to assess the impact of various dosimetric parameters, such as EUD, peak-to-valley ratio (PVDR), D5%, D10%, D20%, D90%, etc., on the effectiveness of treatments.

AB  - The substantial contribution of the global construction sector to greenhouse gas emissions underscores the urgency of mitigating its environmental impact. This study addresses the pressing need for sustainable practices in the construction sector, focusing on the intricate relationship between concrete grade selection, bridge span length, embodied carbon, and construction costs within a concrete T-girder highway bridge design. By examining various girder spacings, concrete grades, and bridge spans, this study aims to provide holistic insights into material optimisation for structural efficiency, sustainability, and economic viability. Notably, the findings reveal a nuanced understanding of design parameters, with shorter spans exhibiting minimal sensitivity to girder spacing and concrete grade, whereas longer spans highlight their significant role in shaping embodied carbon and cost. The results also show a remarkable similarity between the C25/30 and C32/40 concrete grades, emphasizing the need for a strategic balance between environmental and financial performance. This study underscores scientific rigour and methodological robustness, providing useful contributions to the field of sustainable construction practices. In conclusion, this research advocates a balanced approach that integrates concrete grade, girder spacing, and span length considerations to optimise sustainability and economic feasibility in concrete T-girder bridge designs. These insights facilitate informed decision-making, aligning with evolving trends towards environmentally conscious infrastructure development.

AB  - Green roof installations and photovoltaic (PV) systems are widely employed roof retrofits that aid cities in mitigating climate change impacts, while avoiding the need for increased land utilization. By integrating PV systems with vegetation on urban roofs, a photovoltaic-green (PV-Green) system can be achieved for multifunctional use of the roof space, thereby simultaneously achieving PV and greening benefits. However, current research solely based on one retrofit type cannot meet the requirement for assessing the multifunctional retrofit potential of urban roofs. In this study, an assessment method is proposed to identify and quantify the multiple retrofit potential of urban roofs by integrating roof attributes (slope, orientation, and area), roof type (gable or flat), solar attributes (radiation and irradiation duration), and biogeochemical simulation. Moreover, three roof retrofit scenarios, Scenario 1 (S1): maximization of PV-Green roofs, Scenario 2 (S2): maximization of PV economic benefits, and Scenario 3 (S3): maximization of public subjective well-being through roof greening, were designed to allocate the use of urban roof spaces and evaluate their respective potential power and carbon benefits at the city scale. Using Shanghai's downtown as an example, the results showed that 85,722 roofs (or 7310.86 ha) were available for multifunctional use. S1 revealed that applying PV-Green roofs can increase the additional green biomass by 0.74 x 107 kg C/yr compared to only installing PV roofs. Moreover, S1 produced the highest power output of 2.31 x 1010 kWh/yr to meet 15.4% of Shanghai's electricity demand. S2 identified 609 flat roofs and 70,527 gable roofs that were uneconomical for PV system installation. This indicated that the solar radiation received by most gable roofs was insufficient to cover the installation cost. S3 offered a biomass production of 1.48 x 107 kg C/yr and increased carbon stocks in Shanghai by 0.87%. This assessment method provides urban planners and policymakers with an analytical tool to optimize the use of urban roof spaces, thereby enhancing urban livability and sustainability.

AB  - A generalized, lumped-parameter ecological model PnET-CN was calibrated and validated for a subtropical coniferous plantation in southern China. PnET-CN model describes the biogeochemical cycles of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) and can assist in estimating carbon sequestration potential. For validation of PnET-CN, data from coniferous forest plantations in southern China was used. Simulated daily gross primary productivity (GPP) from 2005 to 2007 agreed well with observations (R-2=0.56, S.D.=0.009). Simulations of monthly soil respiration (R-s) from 2005-2007 agreed well with R-s observations (R-2=0.67, S.D. =0.03). Simulated annual net primary productivity (NPP) from 1998-2006 was 803 33 gCm(-2)a(-1), about 4% higher than NPP observation (752 +/- 51 gCm(-2)a(-1)). Simulations of annual NEP from 2005-2007 only overestimate 9 gCm(-2)a(-1) (4%), 4 gCm(-2)a(-1) (1%) and 34 gCm(-2)a(-1) (8%) compared to NEP observations, respectively. Simulated annual foliar N concentration (FoINCon) (1.09%) is 10% lower than observed monthly FoINCon (0.87%-1.58%). Simulated annual N leaching (0.26 gNm(-2)) is about 10% lower than leaching observation (0.29 gNm(-2)). PnET-CN model validation indicates that PnET-CN is capable to simulate daily GPP, annual NPP, annual NEP, monthly R-s, annual FoINCon and annual nitrate N leaching for subtropical coniferous plantations in southern China. The results obtained from the validation test revealed that PnET-CN model can be used to simulate carbon sequestration of planted coniferous forests in southern China to a high level of precision. Sensitivity analysis suggests that great care should be taken in developing generalizations as to how forests will respond to a changing climate. PnET-CN performed satisfactorily in comparison to other models that have already been calibrated and validated in coniferous planted subtropical forests in China. Based on PnET-CN validation and its comparison to other models, future improvement of PnET-CN should focus on seasonal foliar N dynamics and the effects of water stress on autotrophic respirations in subtropical coniferous plantations in southern China.

We conducted a web-based survey to determine whether Extension agents in Florida were prepared to deal with contentious issues. Survey respondents identified issues affecting their clientele, levels of frequency with which they addressed the issues, and self-perceived levels of knowledge related to the issues. Results were analyzed by agent type (i.e., programmatic area). Results revealed that the issues of immigration, crop diseases, and food security held particular potential for improvement.

AB  - BackgroundThe San Joaquin Valley (SJV) in California is one of the most polluted regions in the U.S. This study examined favorability for air pollution mitigation policies, interventions, and identified predictors amongst region's residents.MethodsA cross-sectional online survey asked about health status and conditions, self-protective behaviors, attitudes toward air pollution recommendations, air quality information knowledge and mitigation behaviors, as well as whether their views were favorable or unfavorable towards policy and interventions. EuroQOL-5D-3L was utilized to estimate quality-of-life distribution equity and air pollution policy favorability.ResultsA total of 310 adults residing in the SJV participated in the survey. The mean age was 42.90 years, with 34% having asthma. People with asthma reported the lowest health-related quality of life (HRQoL) compared to other air pollution "sensitive" groups. Concerns included the costs, charge and attributes of adopting hybrid or electric vehicles. Residents supported air pollution control and public space preservation, with socioeconomic factors and health state being significant predictors. Left-wing ideologies favor policies charging polluters, controlling emissions, and preserving public spaces, whereas right-wing views negatively predict support for electric vehicle charges and local organization interventions.ConclusionsResults may help air pollution control policymakers, public health agencies, environmental justice organizations, and the health equity research community understand the reasons for differential responses to air pollution interventions and mitigation efforts. This new knowledge could assist stakeholders in recommending sustainable and cost-effective interventions for improving air quality, elicit behavior change, and climate change adaptation in the region.

AB  - The aim of the research was to assess the impact of a new structure of human capital on high value-added economic sectors in European countries. The conducted theoretical and empirical research has shown that the proposed new concept of human capital has a place to be. Three dimensions of human capital, such as quality, quantity and value, have different impacts on different sectors of European economies. Based on empirical data, the multiple linear regression model was chosen as a method that the best-fit structure of the data collected. The proposed econometric model revealed that the value of human capital is the most important component among three having very close statistical interconnections with qualitative dimensions. It was researched that Scandinavian countries scored the highest level of value dimension of human capital as well as high value-added in the economy. Open, trusted, tolerant, culturally diverse societies create preconditions for a rise for creative culture, which is a source for the formation of technological innovations and adaptation in high value-added economic sectors. Moreover, because of this value-added chain, technological innovations penetrate traditional industries as mining brings the reduction of cost, the increase in productivity and value-added, safety, and shared value in society through environmental issues.

AB  - This study underscores the critical role of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and addresses the potential for CCS projects in saline aquifers in Brazil, one of the world's largest carbon emitters. The country's ability to adopt CCS is significantly influenced by the availability of data related to regional CO2 storage potential and identifying suitable geological framework for CO2 injection. While oil and gas reservoirs have traditionally been prioritized, saline aquifers represent an underexplored and potentially higher capacity storage option. Despite Brazil's 31 sedimentary basins, the data quantity and availability for these contexts remain insufficient for advanced studies on the geological storage of CO2 considering saline aquifers. An initial study was conducted indicating five potential targets in the Parana and Potiguar Basins for geological storage in saline aquifers based on available public data, mainly drilling data. This review reveals substantial challenges related to the evaluation of Brazil's CO2 storage capacity, such as the lack of modern seismic studies, the absence of a regulatory framework for CO2 storage, and insufficient investment in new well exploration. These challenges necessitate multistakeholder collaboration, the development of a supportive regulatory environment, and investment in extensive site characterization campaigns. Addressing these barriers is fundamental to realizing the country's CCS potential and contributing to global decarbonization efforts.

AB  - Ocean-based carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (CDR) strategies are an important part of the portfolio of approaches needed to achieve negative greenhouse gas emissions. Many ocean-based CDR strategies rely on injecting CO2 or organic carbon (that will eventually become CO2) into the ocean interior, or enhancing the ocean's biological pump. These approaches will not result in permanent sequestration, because ocean currents will eventually return the injected CO2 back to the surface, where it will be brought into equilibrium with the atmosphere. Here, a model of steady state global ocean circulation and mixing is used to assess the time scales over which CO2 injected in the ocean interior remains sequestered from the atmosphere. There will be a distribution of sequestration times for any single discharge location due to the infinite number of pathways connecting a location at depth with the sea surface. The resulting probability distribution is highly skewed with a long tail of very long transit times, making mean sequestration times much longer than typical time scales. Deeper discharge locations will sequester purposefully injected CO2 much longer than shallower ones and median sequestration times are typically decades to centuries, and approach 1000 years in the deep North Pacific. Large differences in sequestration times occur both within and between the major ocean basins, with the Pacific and Indian basins generally having longer sequestration times than the Atlantic and Southern Oceans. Assessments made over a 50 year time horizon illustrates that most of the injected carbon will be retained for injection depths greater than 1000 m, with several geographic exceptions such as the Western North Atlantic. Ocean CDR strategies that increase upper ocean ecosystem productivity with the goal of exporting more carbon to depth will have mainly a short-term influence on atmospheric CO2 levels because similar to 70% will be transported back to the surface ocean within 50 years. The results presented here will help plan appropriate ocean CDR strategies that can help limit climate damage caused by fossil fuel CO2 emissions.

AB  - An integrated assessment of carbon balance in biomass removed during lumbering and transformed into products of forest, woodworking, and pulp and paper industry is conducted. Carbon sequestration was calculated with the IPCC technique. Depending on the economic state of the forest complex, from 1961 to 2005, its products can be both a source of emission of about 15 Mt CO(2) per year and a pool that can uptake up to 54.1 Mt CO(2) per year. In 2004, 28.3 Mt CO(2) or 1.4% equivalent emission from other national economy sectors came to forest products from the atmosphere. Rational use of forest products and reduced non-productive losses of raw wood can lead to a significant contribution of the forest complex to decrease in greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere.

AB  - Urban, peri urban and patch forests play a critical role in climate change mitigation through increased carbon storage and for that, it is imperative to assess the species response in an eco-region to recommend a potentially higher carbon sequestering species. In urban settings, green spaces, in particular, trees play a vital role in pre-serving biodiversity, reducing the impact of urban heat islands, enhancing the hydrological cycle, as well as sequestering carbon. When introduced in urban greening projects, native species provide better ecosystem ser-vices, conserve and maintain biodiversity more sustainably than exotic species. However, fewer efforts are being made to evaluate the carbon sequestration potential of native tropical tree species in urban greening initiatives. The present study aims to assess the biomass production and carboxylation efficiency of three native tropical tree species to identify the high carbon sequestering species, which will enhance the carbon stocks under urban green spaces. Above ground biomass, carbon stock and physiological performance of three native tropical tree species (Tectona grandis, Mallotus nudiflorus and Syzygium cumini) were measured in Botanical Garden of CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute, Lucknow for eight years old tree stands. Above ground biomass (AGB, Mg/ha) was measured using a non-destructive method by applying allometric equations. Tree height, diameter at breast height (DBH) and leaf area index (LAI) was maximum in T. grandis stand (10.43 m, 29.21 cm, 1.95, respectively). Maximum AGB (71.94 Mg/ha) and carbon stock (25.54 Mg/ha) was observed in T. grandis plantations among the three tree stands. T. grandis stand also had maximum litter fall (5.82 Mg/ha). Highest diurnal photosynthesis rate, water use efficiency and stomatal conductance were also observed in T. grandis stand. However, maximum photosynthetic rate was observed in Mallotus nudiflorus. One way ANOVA revealed significant differences (p < 0.001) in AGB, carbon stock and physiological parameters among the three species. Pearson's Correlation matrix established the positive relationship between growth performance and physiological traits of species with their capacity to sequester carbon. T. grandis can be promoted for urban greening projects for achieving carbon sequestration targets with short time span, however plantation of mixed native species will provide better de-livery of all ecosystem services in sustainable mode. Results from the present study shed light on the patterns of carbon sequestration by these species, which in turn will help in the decision-making process for sustainable urban greening. Further, more tropical species can be assessed for their biomass and carbon capture capacities to determine the best species matrix for plantations to enhance carbon storage and develop climate resilient greenbelt under urban landscape forestry programs.

AB  - In sustainable education, it is important to analyze student diversity in order to create strategies that allow for the implementation of inclusive education based on the differences observed among students. To achieve this, a sample of 321 first-year engineering students (107 females and 214 males) at a private university in northeast Mexico was analyzed during the 2020 academic year. Students were classified according to their gender, engineering program, and the development of their multiple intelligences according to Howard Gardner theory of multiple intelligences. To verify the effect of gender and program factors on the development of multiple intelligences, Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed with alpha = 0.05. The analysis of the effects of gender identified significant differences in four intelligences: linguistic and interpersonal (for which the female students obtained higher mean scores) and mathematical and visual (for which the male students obtained higher mean scores). The analysis of the effects of the engineering program identified significant differences in five intelligences: mathematical, visual, and musical (for which civil engineering students obtained a higher mean score than the students in the other programs); kinesthetic (for which computer science students obtained a lower mean score than students in the other programs); and naturalistic (for which sustainability engineering students obtained a higher mean score than students in the other programs). These differences allowed us to observe the characteristics of the students and to develop more inclusive courses in order to make the teaching and learning process more optimal and sustainable.

AB  - In a rare empirical approach, and considering the uniqueness of the Nordic economy, this study examines the differential effect of domestic material utilization, i.e., biomass, fossil fuel, metallic ores, and non-metallic ores on the sectoral greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, i.e., industrial, agricultural, land use, land use change and forestry (LULCF), waste management, and energy GHG emissions in the period 1990-2020. By applying competent econometric tools that accounts for potential estimation bias, the result revealed that metallic ore consumption among the Nordic countries is detrimental to the region's environmental sustainability, more so to the region's greening circular economy drive. This is because metallic ore utilization spurs industrial, agricultural, LULCF, waste management, and energy GHG emissions. Similarly, biomass material consumption spurs GHG emissions arising from the LULCF, waste management, and energy sector activities while fossil fuel materials spur LULCF and energy GHG emissions. However, non-metallic ores consumption provides a desirable outcome as it mitigates GHG emission with respective elasticities of similar to 0.06, similar to 0.01, and similar to 0.05, in the industrial, agricultural, and waste management sector activities while biomass also plays a statistically significant role of reducing agricultural GHG emission by similar to 0.02% when there is a percent increase in the consumption of biomass. Important policy measures are put forward following the interesting revelation from the investigation.

AB  - When attempting to address the environmental problems of a catchment, it is important to consider changes in a long-term environmental context. However, the long-term data on the state of the environment that are required for such an examination are rarely documented. Such data collection typically requires several years of investigation and observation. In addition, as there may be a significant time lag between the occurrence of a phenomenon and its cause, subsequent environmental investigations of changing animal and plant states scaling up to 5 years may be inadequate. We conducted a long-term analysis of the environmental changes in five sub-catchments of the Nagara River, Japan, assessing a period of 30 years, using a questionnaire survey approach involving local communities. Four sub-catchments of the Yoshida River were also analyzed for comparison. In addition, we attempted to clarify the relationship between various environmental factors and the space-time response of animals and plants. The survey included eight topics: assumed information, hydrological characteristics, habitat conditions for living things, forest state, land cover conditions, river awareness, free-entry information, and respondent information. Our method also has academic significance in that it validates the environmental agent extraction technique using a questionnaire survey. Our results identify management strategies for minimizing biodiversity loss due to climate change. Forest management and human activities should be undertaken with care, and the environmental context going forward into the next century should be considered for integrated catchment management. Elsewhere, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, a much expanded network of protected areas, and/or efforts to provide corridors to ease species movements may be necessary at the global level.

AB  - Decarbonizing the building sector is extremely important to mitigating climate change as the sector contributes 40% of the overall energy consumption and 36% of the total greenhouse gas emissions in the world. Net-zero energy buildings are one of the promising decarbonization attempts due to their potential of decreasing the use of energy and increasing the total share of renewable energy. To achieve a net zero energy building, it is necessary to decrease the energy demand by applying efficiency enhancement measures and using renewable energy sources. Net-zero energy buildings can be classified into four models (Net-Zero Site Energy buildings, Net-Zero Emissions buildings, Net-Zero Source Energy buildings, and Net-Zero Cost Energy buildings). A variety of technical, financial, and environmental factors should be considered during the decision-making process of net-zero energy building development, justifying the use of multi-criteria decision analysis methods for the design of net-zero energy buildings. This paper also discussed the contributions of renewable energy generation (hydropower, wind energy, solar, heat pumps, and bioenergy) to the development of net-zero energy buildings and reviewed its role in tackling the decarbonization challenge. Cost-benefit analysis and life cycle assessment of net-zero energy building designs and their challenges were reviewed to shape the priorities of future development. It is important to develop a universal decision instrument for optimum design and operation of net-zero energy buildings. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Predation and food supply are generally perceived as important determinants of spatial and temporal variations of populations. The population dynamics of freshwater rotifers have been well researched in this aspect. However, their spatial variations have attracted less attention and have not been studied by simultaneously considering both predation and food supply. We studied spatial variations of rotifer abundance among 34 Canadian boreal lakes. A large part of the variance of rotifer abundance was associated with variables related to trophic status including chlorophyll a and total phosphorus. However, abundances of mesozooplankton such as potential predators and competitors did not correlate with rotifer abundance and did not explain the residual of the regression between rotifer abundance and chlorophyll a. The results of the present study indicated that variation in rotifer abundance among lakes was caused by 'bottom-up' forces related to food supply and not by 'top-down' predatory interactions. This provides a contrast to previous empiric and experimental studies that reported that temporal variations of rotifer abundance were mainly regulated by 'top-down' interactions. This discrepancy suggests that overall differences in rotifer abundance among lakes are mainly determined by 'bottom-up' forces while temporal changes in single lakes are shaped by 'top-down' forces. Meanwhile, the composition of rotifer species was correlated with mesozooplankton abundance as well as trophic status. Rotifer species with long spines or rigid loricae were found in the lakes where mesozooplankton were abundant, which suggests that defensive morphology could have affected the rotifer species distribution among the study lakes.

AB  - The maintenance of human well-being and development is dependent on ecosystem goods and services. However, natural ecosystems and biodiversity have been disturbed by human activities. Therefore, assessment of ecosystem health has become one of the main topics in landscape management. The aim of this study is to reveal the effects of land use/land cover (LULC) change on regional ecosystem health (REH) in Izmir, Turkey. The study used the vigour, organization and resilience model together with potential ecosystem services to understand the relationships between LULC structure, ecosystems and human activities using the most populous and urbanized parts of Izmir metropolitan city. For this purpose, the CORINE land cover maps and Landsat satellite images for 1990 and 2018 were used. Our results showed that there was an increase in the mean regional ecosystem health value (from 48.06 to 49.32) during 1990-2018, but it changed in an inconsistent way in the different parts of the study area. The urban sprawl type and the presence of vegetation were important factors affecting the overall REH value. The spatiotemporal LULC changes were effective on all the ecosystem health indicators. Among all the ecosystem health indicators, ecosystem vigour and resilience were the most important factors positively affected the REH level in highly urbanized districts. Overall, our study showed that whilst the gains in vegetation between urban and rural areas enhanced the ecosystem vigour and resilience during 1990-2018, they have also improved the regional health of districts located along the coastal parts of the study area.

AB  - This paper investigates the effects of attitudes towards sustainable consumption and sustainable behaviours. Income as the control variable and gender, age, assets, and educational level as moderators were included. To achieve the aims of the study, a critical literature review, exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation modelling were performed. Data were obtained using the CAWI technique on a sample of 1200 adult consumers. The findings show that attitudes towards sustainable consumption are positively associated with sustainable behaviours, and that income significantly determines dimensions of attitudes towards sustainable consumption and sustainable behaviours. Additionally, the relationships between income, dimensions of attitude towards sustainable consumption, and particular sustainable behaviours in groups distinguished by gender, age, property ownership, and education level were confirmed.

AB  - Prior studies establish that electricity systems across the globe need to transition toward renewable energy and that renters have a low adoption of effective means to do so through access to household solar photovoltaics (PV). Yet, the economic, environmental, and social costs of low PV adoption by people who have trouble paying their electricity bills (hardship customers), who are more likely to be low-income tenants, remain understudied. Drawing on electricity use data from an Australian energy retailer we compare the performance of PV for hardship customers against 'average' households. Results illustrate that if society could achieve greater solar PV installation on hardship homes, annual grid-based electricity consumption could be reduced by 40%, lowering greenhouse gas emissions by 1.6 tCO(2)e per household annually and energy bills by $2908 per low-income household over 15 years. We illustrate how Australian policy could be re-oriented to encourage greater PV adoption on hardship properties, including through support for a new market structure that distributes the economic benefits of PV between renters and landlords.

AB  - Reliable measurement of greenhouse gas emissions from reservoirs is essential for estimating the carbon footprint of the hydropower industry. Among the different emission pathways, degassing downstream of the turbines and spillway is poorly documented mainly because of the safety stakes related to sampling up and downstream the power plants. The alternative being to sample the water from the turbine inside the station, this study aimed to assemble a custom automated CO2 and CH4 monitoring system (SAGES), especially designed for long-term surveys in hydropower facilities, with a special focus on low maintenance requirements. The SAGES combines infrared and laser technologies with a modular programming approach and run with a specifically designed plexiglass equilibration system (PES) that maintain a permanent headspace and avoid clogging by suspended solids. Although the SAGES is based on commercially available devices, it is the first time they are combined and used with the gas equilibrator. To ensure the reliability of the mounting and to control the quality of the readings, the system was tested in laboratory prior to its installation in generating stations. SAGES and PES performances were compared with those of generic devices available on the market although less adapted to the specific deployments targeted. The SAGES gas partial pressure measurements were accurate and linear in the entire range tested: 0 to 5,000 ppm for pCO(2) and 0 to 600 and 10,000 ppm for pCH(4). Gas PP measurements were comparable to the reference CO2/CH4 sensor and there was no drift during long term deployment. The SAGES/PES installed in 2021 in cascading generating stations of the Romaine complex collected more than 28,000 data points over a 10-month period and required only two maintenances. Results show that the SAGES is a reliable tool that provide long-term CO2 and CH4 dataset in generating stations while requiring minimal energy, care and maintenance. The data collected in turbine water and the recent use of the SAGES in peat land by a collaborative team demonstrate how the SAGES systems can efficiently contribute to the understanding of reservoir carbon cycles.

AB  - This study investigates the potential of hydrogen and ammonia, as alternatives for transportation fuels to tackle urgent issues concerning greenhouse gas emissions and air quality in the worldwide transportation sector. By examining studies and technological progresses, we evaluate the feasibility of transitioning to these energy options. Through an investigation of production methods, energy efficiency, environmental consequences, and infrastructure requirements, we present both the advantages and disadvantages of using hydrogen and ammonia as fuel substitutes. We spotlight production techniques such as electrolysis and renewable energy sources that could significantly decrease carbon emissions and air pollutants. Nonetheless, key challenges such as expanding infrastructure, cost-effectiveness, and safety considerations need to be resolved for adoption. Drawing on findings from research and industry developments, this article contributes to publications on transportation solutions while proposing avenues for research efforts and policy initiatives. Existing challenges and limitations are also discussed in details. In conclusion, this research underscores the significance of research endeavors and policy backing to unlock the potential of hydrogen and ammonia as sustainable transportation fuels underscoring their role in mitigating environmental impacts and promoting global sustainability objectives.

AB  - Urban green and blue spaces (UGBS) are key for biodiversity conservation. Many studies focus on UGBS benefits for well-being, but how UGBS ecological and quality influence urban biodiversity is still poorly understood. We analysed the predictive accuracy of urban wildness (UW) and habitat quality (HQ) spatial patterns to biodiversity in the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz, Basque Country. Using GIS techniques, we mapped relative UW as a landscape quality, considering remoteness, challenging terrain, and perceived naturalness. We further evaluated HQ using the InVEST habitat quality module, including data on habitat sensitivity to threats (e.g. population density, light and noise pollution, accessibility) and suitability for biodiversity support, based on a parametrization by expert consultation. We compared UW and HQ to observed species richness obtained from crowd-sourced databases as a biodiversity proxy. UW and HQ models predicted general biodiversity urban patterns, being particularly adequate in UGBS. Peripheral UGBS were associated with higher UW and HQ and positively correlated to biodiversity, as opposed to the smaller-sized centrally located UGBS, more exposed to threats. Both predictors significantly explained biodiversity, and HQ better accounted for threat susceptibility in UGBS. Our findings suggest that small-sized UGBS, such as parks and squares, fail to effectively support urban biodiversity, due to their high exposure and vulnerability to threats, particularly in centric areas. Emphasizing efforts in larger centric UGBS with rewilding strategies (e.g. lowering management frequency) and reducing exposure to threats is essential to increase the habitat quality of UGBS and thus support urban biodiversity.

AB  - We examine the response of technological change to one of the major environmental regulations in the European Union (EU) - the Ambient Air Quality Directive (AAQD). Our identification strategy exploits the structure of this directive, which imposes air quality measures in regions exceeding pollutant concentration limits. We implement a quasi difference-in-differences strategy and test for the effect of environmental measures on innovation in 654 technology classes at the EU region (NUTS-2) level over the 1999-2015 period. We show that AAQD environmental measures drive the specialisation of regions in green technologies. We find a positive effect for patents in the two most prevailing green technology classes, i.e., clean energy and industrial processes, as well as evidence of spatial leakage.

AB  - There is urgent need for the transformation of built environments to tackle climate change. The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to achieve the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to well below 2 degrees C is of paramount importance, as is planning for future climate change risks. Architects, as designers of the built environment hold an important role in advocating and enabling the necessary mitigation and adaptation actions required in the design and construction of new buildings, and the reuse of existing built fabric - to reduced embodied carbon and achieve operational energy efficiency. Despite the importance, most built environments do not yet adequately address climate change. Limited research has examined the barriers that architectural professionals encounter when integrating climate change action in their projects during their role designing built environments. This is the gap that this research addresses. Interviews with twenty-two Australian architectural practitioners were undertaken, to investigate their experience of barriers to and facilitators of climate change action in their professional practice. Four key themes were found: 1) actors, 2) processes and structures, 3) information and knowledge, and 4) the role of government. Barriers and facilitators were found to be embedded in architects' perception of their role, the processes and practices they undertake, and their relationship with other stakeholders. The facilitators identified can assist drive better outcomes for future design and construction of buildings. Recommendations identified include: 1) build architects' confidence and capability to be advocates; 2) develop of architects' climate change knowledge and competence; 3) transform design processes to be more circular, interdisciplinary and long term focused, and 4) reform current built environment policy to adequately consider climate change.

AB  - We performed bimonthly mosquito larval collections during 1 year, in an agricultural settlement in the Brazilian Amazon, as well as an analysis of malaria incidence in neighboring houses. Water collections located at forest fringes were more commonly positive for Anopheles darlingi larvae and Kulldorff spatial analysis pinpointed significant larval clusters at sites directly beneath forest fringes, which were called larval "hotspots." Remote sensing identified 43 "potential" hotspots. Sampling of these areas revealed an 85.7% positivity rate for A. darlingi larvae. Malaria was correlated with shorter distances to potential hotpots and settlers living within 400 m of potential hotspots had a 2.60 higher risk of malaria. Recently arrived settlers, usually located closer to the tip of the triangularly shaped deforestation imprints of side roads, may be more exposed to malaria due to their proximity to the forest fringe. As deforestation progresses, transmission decreases. However, forest remnants inside deforested areas conferred an increased risk of malaria. We propose a model for explaining frontier malaria in the Amazon: because of adaptation of A. darlingi to the forest fringe ecotone, humans are exposed to an increased transmission risk when in proximity to these areas, especially when small dams are created on naturally running water collections.

AB  - This article reviews the current experience and the flaws encountered in the rush to deploy telemedicine as a substitute for in-person care in response to the raging coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic; the preceding fault lines in the U.S. health care system that exacerbated the problem; and the importance of emerging from this calamity with a clear vision for necessary health care reforms. It starts with the premise that the precursors of catastrophes of this magnitude provide a valid basis for planning corrective measures, improved preparedness, and ultimately serious health reform. Such reform should include standardized protocols for proper deployment of telemedicine to triage patients to the appropriate level and source of care at the point of need, proper use of relevant technological innovations to deliver precision medicine, and the development of regional networks to coordinate and improve access to care while streamlining the care process. The other essential element is a universal payment system that puts the United States at par with the rest of the industrialized countries, regardless of variation among them. The ultimate goal is creating an efficient, effective, accessible, and equitable system of care. Although timing is uncertain, the pandemic will be brought under control. The path to a better future after the pandemic offers some consolation for the massive loss of life and treasure during this pandemic.

AB  - In addition to available country or site-specific life cycle studies on Jatropha biodiesel we present a generic, location-independent life cycle assessment and provide a general but in-depth analysis of the environmental performance of Jatropha biodiesel for transportation. Additionally, we assess the influence of changes in byproduct use and production chain. In our assessments, we went beyond the impact on energy requirement and global warming by including impacts on ozone layer and terrestrial acidification and eutrophication. The basic Jatropha biodiesel system consumes eight times less nonrenewable energy than conventional diesel and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 51%. This result coincides with the lower limit of the range of reduction percentages available in literature for this system and for other liquid biofuels. The impact on the ozone layer is also lower than that provoked by fossil diesel, although eutrophication and acidification increase eight times. This study investigates the general impact trends of the Jatropha system, although not considering land-use change. The results are useful as a benchmark against which other biodiesel systems can be evaluated, to calculate repayment times for land-use change induced carbon loss or as guideline with default values for assessing the environmental performance of specific variants of the system.

AB  - Cities are a key target in the global quest for sustainability and are increasingly acting independently to take the lead in sustainability initiatives. To truly achieve sustainability, cities need to ensure that their consumption is compatible with absolute sustainability and validate achievements from a perspective that includes transboundary impacts. The aim of this review is to assess how well these topics are incorporated into commonly used urban sustainability assessment methods, using the safe and just space (SJS) framework definition of a minimum acceptable threshold for both ecological stability and standard of living. The review identified 277 different sustainability indicator frameworks that have been applied to cities and undertook a detailed assessment of the most commonly cited of these. Consumption-based footprint studies were separately assessed to determine the extent to which they measure SJS indicators for cities. Both indicator frameworks and footprint studies had a focus on boundaries of increasing risk, including carbon, water, and land use; however few measured highly exceeded boundaries including nitrogen and phosphorus use, biodiversity, and possibly chemical pollution. Social impacts were well covered in indicator frameworks, except food intake, but largely absent from footprint studies. Cities are largely not measuring their impact on planetary tipping points or transboundary impacts, risking resolving some environmental issues while exacerbating others.

AB  - We consider the problem of inventory routing in the context of perishable products and find near-optimal replenishment scheduling and vehicle routes when the objective is to maximize the supplier's profit and minimize the costs due to fuel consumption, inventory holding, and greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions are calculated as a function of fuel consumed, and fuel consumption levels are accurately calculated as a function of vehicle speed, load and traveled distance. To solve the problem efficiently, we develop an exact method based on Benders decomposition to find high-quality solutions in reasonable time. To enhance the convergence rate of the Benders decomposition algorithm, we present several acceleration strategies, such as addition of valid inequalities to the master problem and warm-up start. The warm-up start acceleration strategy itself is a meta-heuristic based on the greedy random adaptive search procedure (GRASP) and mathematical programming formulations. We present computational results which illustrate the superior performance of the proposed solution methodology in solving large-scale instances with 60 customers and 6 planning periods with 4 vehicles using Benders decomposition. Additionally, we show that utilizing a more comprehensive model to calculate the fuel cost results in fuel savings of 2 to 11% on the tested instances compared to traditional models that assume that the fuel cost is solely a function of the distance traveled during delivery.

AB  - To address the problem of human induced climate change effectively, climate policy must embody the principles of economic efficiency, environmental effectiveness and equity. In this paper it is shown that such a climate change policy should include a broad coverage of major greenhouse gases and sources. ABARE's Global Trade and Environment Model (GTEM) is used to analyse the economic impact of meeting a radiative forcing target using policies that focus on carbon dioxide emissions only and policies that focus on all major greenhouse gases and sources, including land use change and forestry emissions. It is projected that incorporating non-carbon dioxide gases into climate change policy reduces the economic adjustment cost significantly. Broadening the sources of carbon dioxide to include land use change and forestry emissions further reduces the economic adjustment costs.

AB  - Air emissions from shipping have received attention in recent years and the shipping industry is striving for solutions to reduce their emissions and to comply with stricter regulations. Strategies to reduce emissions can consist of a fuel switch, engine changes, or end-of-pipe technologies, but they do not necessarily imply reduced life cycle emissions. The present paper assesses the environmental performance of marine fuels from well-to-propeller using life cycle assessment (LCA). Four fossil fuels are compared: heavy fuel oil (HFO), marine gas oil, gas-to-liquid (GTL) fuel, and liquefied natural gas (LNG), combined with two exhaust abatement techniques: open-loop scrubber and selective catalytic reduction. LNG and other alternatives that comply with the SECA 2015 and Tier III NOx requirements give decreased acidification and eutrophication potentials with 78-90 per cent in a life cycle perspective compared with HFO. In contrast, the use of LNG does not decrease the global warming potential by more than 8-20 per cent, the amount depending mainly on the magnitude of the methane slip from the gas engine. None of the fossil fuels scrutinized here would decrease the greenhouse gas emissions significantly from a life cycle perspective. The study supports the need for LCA when evaluating the environmental impact of a fuel change, e.g. it is found that the highest global warming potential during the whole life cycle is connected to the alternatives with GTL fuel.

AB  - Despite growing interest in proposals for a universal basic income, little advance has been made in implementation. Here we explore policy options for an Australian Basic Income. Our analysis responds to concerns that Basic Income is both too expensive and too radical a departure from existing welfare state structures to be a feasible policy option. Drawing on policy and Basic Income scholarship we identify changes to Australia's current means-tested benefits structures that move substantially towards Basic Income while remaining consistent with historic policy norms, which we call 'affluence testing'. Using microsimulation we explore fiscal and distributional trade-offs associated with the implementation of an affluence-tested Basic Income. Our results suggest Basic Income has the potential to significantly reduce inequality and poverty while also requiring taxes to rise substantially. Placing these trade-offs in international context we find the policy would reduce inequality to levels similar to Nordic welfare states while increasing overall taxation to approximately the OECD average.

AB  - In the ongoing debate about the climate benefits of fuel switching from coal to natural gas for power generation, the metrics used to model climate impacts may be important. In this article, we evaluate the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of coal and natural gas used in new, advanced power plants using a broad set of available climate metrics in order to test for the robustness of results. Climate metrics included in the article are global warming potential, global temperature change potential, technology warming potential, and cumulative radiative forcing. We also used the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse-gas Induced Climate Change (MAGICC) climate-change model to validate the results. We find that all climate metrics suggest a natural gas combined cycle plant offers life cycle climate benefits over 100 years compared to a pulverized coal plant, even if the life cycle methane leakage rate for natural gas reaches 5%. Over shorter time frames (i.e., 20 years), plants using natural gas with a 4% leakage rate have similar climate impacts as those using coal, but are no worse than coal. If carbon capture and sequestration becomes available for both types of power plants, natural gas still offers climate benefits over coal as long as the life cycle methane leakage rate remains below 2%. These results are consistent across climate metrics and the MAGICC model over a 100-year time frame. Although it is not clear whether any of these metrics are better than the others, the choice of metric can inform decisions based on different societal values. For example, whereas annual temperature change reported may be a more relevant metric to evaluate the human health effects of increased heat, the cumulative temperature change may be more relevant to evaluate climate impacts, such as sea-level rise, that will result from the cumulative warming.

AB  - Nano zero -valent iron (nZVI) has been shown to facilitate biofuel production, notably in hydrogen generation. However, its effect on bioethanol production is rarely studied, and even less so on its impact on hydrogen and ethanol co-production. This study therefore conducted ethanol-type hydrogen-producing fermentation with brown algae to explore the effect of nZVI. With the supplementation of nZVI, fermentation was accelerated and the production of hydrogen and ethanol were both significantly enhanced. At the optimal nZVI concentration of 100 mg/L, the production of hydrogen and ethanol increased by 71.44% and 65.11%, respectively. A high hydrogen yield of 2.32 mol/mol-mannitol was achieved. The ethanol yield (1.86 mol/mol-mannitol) reached 93% of the theoretical maximal yield with a high selectivity of 91.09%. Electron distribution analysis showed that nZVI increased the total electron amounts of fermentation, and directed more electrons to ethanol than hydrogen. The reduced redox potential (ORP) and increased NADH level further confirmed the role of nZVI. Moreover, nZVI fostered Fe 2 + availability to hydrogen-producing bacteria, enhancing the enzymes hydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase, as well as cell biomass. The bioenergy conversion efficiency (BioECE) improved from 19.08% to 31.74% with 100 mg/L nZVI treatment. This study provided a first demonstration regarding the role of nZVI in hydrogen and ethanol co-production, highlighting the great potential of multiple bioenergy recovery from marine biomass.

AB  - Sustainable mobility has received increasing attention in recent years. The transport sector contributes to almost a quarter of Europe's greenhouse gas emissions. The development of electric vehicles (EVs) may help the shift toward sustainable mobility, reducing oil vulnerability and greenhouse gas emissions in road transport. Poor penetration of EVs might be explained, moreover, by consumer resistance to EVs. The aim of our paper is to determine consumers' attitude and preferences for EVs, investigating which conditions influence consumer decision-making to purchase an EV. Using a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis of 421 highly-educated individuals, involving students and faculty members, we identify several configurations of conditions of the variables which lead to the outcomes, supporting their equifinality and asymmetric nature. Our findings indicate attitudes related to EVs differ across age and groups. Our paper offers public decision makers new useful insights for understanding the importance of specific determinants, and for designing effective strategies for EVs' development worldwide.

AB  - Novel biomass bioenergy-bioexergy analyses via thermogravimetry analysis and artificial intelligence are employed to evaluate the three biofuels from wood wastes (softwood-SW, hardwood-HW, and woods blend-WB). The chemical characterization of SW has the highest bioenergy (higher heating value - HHV: 18.84 MJ kg(- 1)) and bioexergy (specific chemical bioexergy - SCB: 19.65 MJ kg(- 1)) with the SCB/HHV ratio of wood waste as about 1.043-1.046. The high C-element has a significant influence on the HHV-SCB. The three distinct zones of wood waste combustion are identified: moisture evaporation (Zone I, up to 110 degrees C), combustion reaction - degradation of three major lignocellulosic components (hemicelluloses, cellulose, and lignin) at Zone II, 110-600 degrees C, and ash remains (Zone III, 600-800 degrees C). The ignition (D-ig = 0.01-0.04) and fuel reactivity (R-fuel = 3.82-6.97 %center dot min(- 1)center dot degrees C- 1) indexes are evaluated. The comprehensive combustion index (S-n:>5 x 10(-7)%(2) min(- 2 )degrees C- 3) suggests that wood waste has a better combustion performance than bituminous coal. The statistical evaluation presents that the highest HHV-SCB values are obtained by performing combustion for SW-250 mu m at 15 degrees C center dot min(- 1). The S/ N ratio and ANOVA results agree that the wood waste type and particle size denote the most influential parameters. The artificial neural network prediction shows an excellent result (R-2 = 1) with 1 hidden layer and 5 neuron configurations.

AB  - Sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) can contribute reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional fuel. With the increasing SAFs demand, various generations of resources have been shifted from the 1st generation (oil crops), the 2nd generation (agricultural waste), to the 3rd generation (microalgae). Microalgae are the most suitable feedstock for jet biofuel production than other resources because of their productivity and capability to capture carbon dioxide. However, microalgae-based biofuel has a limitation of high freezing point. Recently, a jet biofuel derived from Euglena wax ester has been paying attention due to its low freezing point. Challenges still remain to enhance production yields in both upstream and downstream processes. Studies on downstream processes as well as techno-economic analysis on biofuel production using Euglena are highly limited to date. Economic aspects for the biofuel production will be ensured via valorization of industrial byproducts such as food wastes.

AB  - A mathematical correlation between biomass kinetic and membrane fouling can improve the understanding and spread of Membrane Bioreactor (MBR) technology, especially in solving the membrane fouling issues. On this behalf, this paper, produced by the International Water Association (IWA) Task Group on Membrane modelling and control, reviews the current state-of-the-art regarding the modelling of kinetic processes of biomass, focusing on modelling production and utilization of soluble microbial products (SMP) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). The key findings of this work show that the new conceptual approaches focus on the role of different bacterial groups in the formation and degradation of SMP/EPS. Even though several studies have been published regarding SMP modelling, there still needs to be more information due to the highly complicated SMP nature to facilitate the accurate modelling of membrane fouling. The EPS group has seldom been addressed in the literature, probably due to the knowledge deficiency concerning the triggers for production and degradation pathways in MBR systems, which require further efforts. Finally, the successful model applications showed that proper estimation of SMP and EPS by modelling approaches could optimise membrane fouling, which can influence the MBR energy consumption, operating costs, and greenhouse gas emissions.

AB  - Immense use of fossil fuels leads to various environmental issues, including greenhouse gas emissions, reduced oil reserves, increased energy costs, global climate changes, etc. These challenges can be tackled by using alternative renewable fuels such as biodiesel. Many studies reported that biodiesel production from microalgae biomass is an environment-friendly and energy-efficient approach, with significantly improved fuel quality in terms of density, calorific value and viscosity. Biodiesel is produced using the transesterification process and the most sustainable method is utilizing enzymes for transesterification. Lipase is an enzyme with excellent catalytic activity, specificity, enantio-selectivity, compatibility and stability and hence it is applied in microalgae biodiesel production. But, difficulty in enzymatic recovery, high enzyme cost and minimal reaction rate are some of its drawbacks that have to be addressed. In this aspect, the nanotechnological approach of lipase immobilization in producing microalgae biodiesel is a promising way to increase production yield and it is due to the adsorption efficiency, economic benefit, recyclability, crystallinity, durability, stability, environmental friendliness and catalytic performance of the bio-nanoparticles used. Through increasing post-harvest biomass yield, absorption of CO2 and photosynthesis in the photobioreactor, the use of nanoparticle immobilized lipase during the generation of biodiesel from microalgae has the potential to also remove feedstock availability constraints. This review article discusses the production of microalgae biodiesel, and effect of nanoparticles and immobilized lipase nanoparticles on biodiesel production. The advantages of using lipase nanoparticles and the challenges in introducing the immobilized lipase on nanoparticles in large-scale microalgae biodiesel production are also discussed. Reducing the water and land use, energy and nutrient footprints of integrated algae-based operations must be the main goal of larger-scale experiments as well as ongoing research and development in order to expedite the adoption of microalgae-based biodiesel production. Also, the cost-effectiveness and large-scale availability of nanoparticles and the impact of lipase nanoparticles on engine performance should be analyzed for commercialization of microalgae biodiesel.

AB  - The sustainable and eco-friendly economic growth of a country is associated with its economic progress and the advancement of its bioenergy sector. Biowaste can be used to produce bioenergy and is increasingly being recognized as a promising resource for filling the energy gap. However, in developing countries, biowaste-to-energy techniques are relatively immature owing to economic and technological challenges, forcing these countries to export cheap biowaste and obtain expensive energy imports. In this study, country-wise export data of potential biowaste materials were gathered, assessed, and filtered according to the feasibility of bioenergy generation. Five developing countries (Argentina, Brazil, India, Thailand, and Ukraine) were selected for the economic assessment based on the export value and revealed comparative advantage (RCA). Argentina has the most exports (9.59 billion USD), with seven biowaste products having RCA >1. The product space model (PSM) was employed to evaluate the income potential of biowaste and to appraise the studied countries overall level of sophistication, and then a suitable industrial policy was proposed according to PSM indicators. All the considered biowaste products have low-income potential, so it is better to produce bioenergy from these products. Thailand has the highest country-level sophistication, followed by India, Brazil, Ukraine, and Argentina. However, ac-cording to the PSM, the EXPY values exhibit significant growth for India (52.3%) and Thailand (31.9%), while the remaining countries experience moderate EXPY growth. Furthermore, Thailand and Ukraine can generate more revenues by opting to bio-energy production. On the PSM industrial policy map, India, Thailand, Brazil and Ukraine lie in "let it be quadrant", while Argentina is in a "parsimonious industrial policy" region. The imple-mentation of the suggested industrial policies can enhance the productive structure of the studied countries and help them achieve their projected growth targets.

AB  - A method is described for genetic detection of mismatch repair products following transformation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The method is based on the detection of .beta.-galactosidase activity in clonal derivatives of cells transformed with heteroduplex plasmid DNA. Heterduplex plasmid substrates were constructed by insertion of an oligonucleotide heteroduplex into the coding sequence of the Escherichia coli lacZ gene. The plasmid and oligonucleotides were designed so that one strand of the construct would code for a functional .beta.-galactosidase and the other strand would contain an in-frame nonsense codon. The frequencies of transformed clones containing only Lac+ cells, only Lac- cells, or a mixture of the two Lac phenotypes provided information on the efficiency of the repair reaction. With this method, plasmids carrying single-base substitution mismatches, a single-base frameshift mismatch (T/.DELTA.), or a 3-base-pair substitution mismatch (TGA/GAA) were tested. A/C, G/T, G/A, G/G, and T/.DELTA. mismatches were repaired with significantly greater efficiencies than C/C, A/A, T/T, and TGA/GAA. T/C was repaired with an intermediate efficiency. The frequencies of products obtained with G/G, G/A, and T/.DELTA. mismatches suggested modest inequality of repair in the two possible directions. Strains carrying the repair-deficient pms1-1 mutation were also tested. The efficiencies of repair of A/C, G/T, G/G, and A/A mismatches were reduced in pms1-1 cells compared with wild-type cells. In addition, a change in repair inequality was detected when transformation of the two strains with an A/C mismatch was compared.

AB  - How effective has the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation been in strengthening the environmental laws and regulations of the NAFTA countries? The agreement was designed to address concerns that trade and investment liberalisation would contribute to a race to the bottom in environmental standards, regulatory chill, and inadequate enforcement of environmental laws. It is argued here that the reformist approach adopted in this regional agreement has been insufficient to offset the continuing pressure on environmental regulations and their enforcement exerted by regional economic integration and neoliberal globalisation.

AB  - Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from road transport is essential to limit global warming. Public policy often relies on costly and time-consuming mechanisms to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, such as subsidies for zero-emission vehicles. We study digital nudges in green information systems as a more cost-effective and faster-to-implement alternative that leverages technology-based just-in-time information to encourage environmental route choice. Using discrete choice experiments that mimic the real-world user experience of Google Maps' eco-route implementation, we show how different presentations of just-in-time information lead to stark differences in eco-route adoption and consumers' willingness to incur longer travel times to save emissions. Our analyses illustrate that optimizing Google Maps' implementation may lead to carbon dioxide emissions savings equivalent to taking 58,000 cars off the road for one year.

AB  - Reducing pollutant emissions from electricity production in the power system positively impacts the control of greenhouse gas emissions. Boosting kernel search optimizer (BKSO) is introduced in this research to solve the combined economic emission dispatch (CEED) problem. Inspired by the foraging behavior in the slime mould algorithm (SMA), the kernel matrix of the kernel search optimizer (KSO) is intensified. The proposed BKSO is superior to the standard KSO in terms of exploitation ability, robustness, and convergence rate. The CEC2013 test function is used to assess the improved KSO's performance and compared to 11 well-known optimization algorithms. BKSO performs better in statistical results and convergence curves. At the same time, BKSO achieves better fuel costs and fewer pollution emissions by testing with four real CEED cases, and the Pareto solution obtained is also better than other MAs. Based on the experimental results, BKSO has better performance than other comparable MAs and can provide more economical, robust, and cleaner solutions to CEED problems.

AB  - Economic growth in Ethiopia, particularly in developing regions, would follow fair income distributions and lower inequality that cannot affect social welfare. In line with the adopted pro-poor fiscal policies since 1995-96, the study looked at how price, tax reforms, and income growth affected social welfare. The study used survey data from the Ethiopian Central Statistical Agency by applying the Atkinson-Gini Index to estimate the level of inequality and social welfare of vulnerable groups. From the analysis, Ethiopia's economic growth was inflationary growth dominate. Price rises increased inequality and reduced consumption than tax reform. The findings invalidated the aim of income growth to mitigate the inflationary impact on welfare increase. Finally, the study found that providing social welfare support to these groups did not increase their ability to withstand the risks of declining welfare. Thus, the study recommended that income redistribution measures aided by pro-poor policies be implemented with caution.

AB  - The 2009 United Nations climate conference in Copenhagen has been widely viewed as a failure-a referendum in the eyes of many on the top-down, comprehensive approach to climate governance embodied in the Kyoto Protocol and carried forward in efforts to negotiate a successor regime. Despite a modest agreement on future work toward a new agreement, the most recent climate meeting in Cancun Mexico reinforces this view, underscoring the conclusion that Copenhagen represents an important inflection point for international climate policy. Although much of the post-Copenhagen commentary has correctly identified various problems, even fatal flaws, with the process, very little has been particularly helpful in marking out a constructive way forward. This Article takes some steps in that direction, offering a partial re-conceptualization of the nature and possibilities of global climate governance in the post-Copenhagen era. It starts from the premise that any realistic approach to climate governance must begin with the facts of globalization, legal pluralism, and fragmentation rather than the view that climate change is a particular kind of global problem that can only be solved through a top-down, supra-national regime aimed at managing the Earth system. As argued here, this "Earth systems governance" approach to the climate change problem, which derives from radically enhanced scientific and technical ways of understanding global environmental change and a particularly narrow view of collective action, has become deeply embedded as a basic objective of climate policy. The resulting logic of global environmental managerialism, however, is very much at odds with the plural, fragmented nature of the international legal and political order-a fact well illustrated by the limited results coming out of the recent climate meetings in Copenhagen and Cancun as well as the near total disarray that marks the current climate policy discourse in the United States and other major emitting countries. In contrast, an alternative, post-Copenhagen approach to the problem of climate governance that starts with the facts of globalization and its implications for law and legal order trains attention to new and different, and much messier, ways of coordinating efforts across jurisdictions and building enabling environments for collective action. This Article maps several key elements of post-Copenhagen climate governance through an analysis of efforts to bring reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation ("REDD") into climate policy. Although deforestation, nearly all of which occurs in the tropics, accounts for some fifteen percent of global carbon dioxide emissions, it has only recently become a major focus of climate policy, emerging as one of the few areas of consensus in the international climate negotiations. As a new paradigm for land use that implicates multiple legal and institutional orders at multiple levels, the REDD experience illustrates both the opportunities and the challenges of constructing climate governance through the complex articulation between distinctively global projects and particular national and sub-national institutions. Approaching climate governance from this perspective provides a basis for some more general claims regarding the possibilities of global environmental law in the context of a plural, fragmented international legal order.

AB  - Harvested wood products (HWP) may contribute to climate change mitigation by storing carbon and by replacing energy-intensive materials and fossil energy, reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, when assessing improved HWP utilisations, interactions between wood use pathways, the carbon stock dynamics, and the resulting effect on the GHG balance are still not well-understood. This research aims to assess the carbon sequestration effects of alternative wood product utilisations in four European Union (EU) countries. We conducted a material flow analysis of wood uses in France, Finland, Germany, and Spain for 2017 taking into account national production, imports, and exports. Then, we quantified the future dynamics of carbon stock in the HWP through time, assuming the same as in 2017 input and ignoring the forest sink. We then ran six alternative scenarios: two energy-focused (Energy, Energy+), two material-focused (Cascading, Material), one with extended half-life of the wood products (HL) and one as business as usual. For the simulation period (2020-2050), the material scenario leads to the highest mitigation benefits with a cumulative HWP net CO2 removals of -502 Mt CO(2 )for Germany, -290 Mt CO2 for France, -118 Mt CO(2 )for Spain, and -116 Mt CO2 for Finland over the 30 years. The Energy+ scenario with an increase in wood usage for bioenergy generates a loss of the HWP pool of 351, 80, 77, and 6 Mt CO2 for the same countries, not accounting for energy substitution effects. Overall, our results suggest that the HWP carbon stock can be increased in the short-medium term by prioritizing the use of wood for material purposes, while maintaining constant harvest. The HWP mitigation potential differed greatly according to national wood industry characteristics. Hence, tailoring the HWP mitigation strategies to the specific characteristics of the national wood chain would enhance the HWP climate benefits.

Gender, age, occupation, and job tenure were predictors for claim rates in 12 industrial sectors. The decline in claims was significantly associated with a decline in the proportion of employment in occupations with high physical demands. These findings should generate interest in economic incentives and regulatory policies designed to encourage investment in safer production processes.

AB  - The annual UN climate summits receive intense global media coverage(1-3), and as such could engage local publics around the world, stimulate debate and knowledge about climate politics, and, ultimately, mobilize people to combat climate change. Herewe showthat, in contrast to these hopes, although the German public were exposed to news about the 2015 Paris summit, they did not engage with it in a more active way. Comparing knowledge and attitudes before, during and after the summit using a three-wave online panel survey (quota sample, N = 1,121), we find that respondents learnt a few basic facts about the conference but they continue to lack basic background knowledge about climate policy. Trust in global climate policy increased a little, but citizens were less inclined to support a leading role for Germany in climate politics. Moreover, they were not more likely to engage personally in climate protection. These results suggest that this global media event had a modest appeasing rather than mobilizing effect.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic spread rapidly throughout the world in early 2020. Beyond the substantial health impacts, the crisis has served as a catalyst for a dramatic shift in working practices, a greater reliance on technology, and a subsequent reduction in air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in the most heavily populated parts of the planet. Indeed, the crisis has highlighted the interconnected nature of society's vulnerabilities while also demonstrating that transformational change is possible. These rapid changes have ignited debate around how to build more resilient societies and the role of planning in promoting equitable and sustainable recovery. This article presents key insights from Ireland, as policymakers grapple with these questions and the role of technology in ensuring ongoing delivery of services and a continuation of democratic processes. Specifically, this short article focuses on the impact of the pandemic on town centres and regional growth in Ireland and the potential interventions which can aid in addressing recently intensified local challenges.

However, this crisis also offers a unique opportunity to move towards a more sustainable and equitable future. Here, we identify the underlying environmental, social, and economic chronic causes of the COVID-19 crisis. We argue in favour of a holistic view to initiate a socio-economic transition to improve the prospects for global sustainability and human well-being. Alternative approaches to "Business-As-Usual" for guiding the transition are already available for implementation. Yet, to ensure a successful and just transition, we need to change our priorities towards environmental integrity and well-being. This necessarily means environmental justice, a different worldview and a closer relationship with nature.

AB  - There is global recognition that sustainable land use requires monitoring that will detect change on a scale that protects the resource. That fundamental necessity is threatened where labor-intensive methods and high labor costs cause sampling deficiencies and increased Type-II error rates (false negatives). Ground-based imaging is a monitoring method that reduces monitoring labor costs. Nadir (vertical) images acquired with common digital cameras can be manually analyzed for cover using free software. We used an innovative field protocol to acquire standardized, freehand, nadir images (samples) of rangeland, then compared point intercept (PI) and image-analysis techniques. Between methods, precision (repeatability) across users was equivalent; cover measurements were often different, and the image-analysis technique took only a third as long to complete. Image analysis has several advantages over PI besides the reduced labor cost: Images are permanent resource records available for reanalysis if data are questioned, if software improves, or if management objectives change; and image analysis is less biased by moving vegetation, moving pointing devices, and bright vegetation color.

AB  - Recent studies show that tropical hydroelectric reservoirs may be responsible for substantial greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere, yet emissions from the surface of released water downstream of the dam are poorly characterized if not neglected entirely from most assessments. We found that carbon dioxide (CO2) emission downstream of Kariba Dam (southern Africa) varied widely over different timescales and that accounting for downstream emissions and their fluctuations is critically important to the reservoir carbon budget. Seasonal variation was driven by reservoir stratification and the accumulation of CO2 in hypolimnetic waters, while subdaily variation was driven by hydropeaking events caused by dam operation in response to daily electricity demand. This "carbopeaking" resulted in hourly variations of CO2 emission up to 200% during stratification. Failing to account for seasonal or subdaily variations in downstream carbon emissions could lead to errors of up to 90% when estimating the reservoir's annual emissions. These results demonstrate the critical need to include both limnological seasonality and dam operation at subdaily time steps in the assessment of carbon budgeting of reservoirs and carbon cycling along the aquatic continuum.

AB  - In recent years, Europe has tightened legislation to combat climate change. The new targets proposed by the different legal instruments include the European Green Deal, Directives RED I and RED II on renewable energies, 'Clean Energy for all Europeans' package, and the recently approved RepowerEU Plan, where the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and the promotion of renewable gases to be less energy-dependant are the focus of all the measures proposed. The adoption of these legal measures in Spain lags behind other countries and some financial aspects are underdeveloped. However, it is worth highlighting the measures that have been approved promote the development of projects in favour of biomethane and other renewable gases and measures to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. This study reviews the available information published in literature and discuss the current situation of biogas and biomethane production in Spain. Biomethane is a clean fuel alternative, which allows value addition to waste from numerous sources, such as landfills, agriculture, and sewage sludge. Spain has potential to produce biomass up to 163 TW h per year with important variations between regions. However, currently, it only has 146 biogas plants in operation (2.74 TW h per year) and 6 are producing biomethane, although a great number of projects are underway for the construction of new biomethane plants. The ability to address the obstacles that presently prevent the building of additional facilities will determine how well biomethane development proceeds in our nation.

AB  - Renewable energy resources are spatially distributed, and their potential to contribute to societal energy supplies is dependent on local geographic nuances. To provide relevant and robust baseline information, these spatial qualities must be considered when assessing resource availability or technology performance. This is the impetus behind the application of geomatics in the field of renewable energy. Given that each renewable energy source option has unique geographic qualities, a one-size-fits-all analytical approach is not possible. It is thus important to examine how the geographic qualities of specific renewable energy options are managed in the methodological approaches that are used to assess them. To this end, this paper reviews the ways in which geomatics has been used to provide geographic information about bioenergy feasibility, and to solve fundamental bioenergy measurement problems in terms of distinguishing actual from potential feedstock, quantifying multiple biomass supply options, and assessing the scope of conversion platforms. Particular attention is given to data quality, the commensurability of data models and the energy sources they attempt to visualize and analyze, the methods used for facility location decisions, and the capacity to perform site-specific analyses of technology performance. The paper also discusses the ways that the 'static' nature of geographic information can be overcome to take seriously the temporal issues that are related to bioenergy feasibility. Moving forward, bioenergy assessments must begin with a comprehensive resource assessment and consider a range of conversion options. This baseline information will enable bioenergy to be taken seriously in energy investment decisions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To address the escalating environmental issues and foster the progress of green development, the Chinese government has initiated the low-carbon city pilot (LCCP) policy since 2010. Assessing the effects of this extensive and multifaceted environmental policy holds substantial theoretical and practical significance, particularly in terms of scrutinizing its impact on enterprise digital transformation (EDT). This study uses the LCCP as a quasi-natural experiment, utilizing the data obtained from Chinese listed companies spanning from 2007 to 2019, and empirically discovers that the LCCP can indeed stimulate enterprises to implement digital transformation strategies. After undergoing a series of robustness checks, including placebo tests and the instrumental variable method, the result obtained was still strongly supported. Heterogeneity tests reveal that the aforementioned conclusion is more typical for samples of non-state-owned and high-tech enterprises. A further mechanistic analysis indicates that the LCCP promotes EDT through two channels: encouraging enterprises to increase R&D expenditure and focusing on improving the resource allocation efficiency. This research, based on the empirical data obtained from China, enriches our understanding of the economic consequences of employing environmental regulations, and also offers valuable insights for other nations into formulating urban emission reduction measures to reap more policy benefits.

AB  - Hundreds of plant species have been domesticated to feed human civilization, while some crops have undergone de-domestication into agricultural weeds, threatening global food security. To understand the genetic and epigenetic basis of crop domestication and de-domestication, we generated DNA methylomes from 95 accessions of wild rice (Oryza rufipogon L.), cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) and weedy rice (O. sativa f. spontanea). We detected a significant decrease in DNA methylation over the course of rice domestication but observed an unexpected increase in DNA methylation through de-domestication. Notably, DNA methylation changes occurred in distinct genomic regions for these 2 opposite stages. Variation in DNA methylation altered the expression of nearby and distal genes through affecting chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, transcription factor binding, and the formation of chromatin loops, which may contribute to morphological changes during domestication and de-domestication of rice. These insights into population epigenomics underlying rice domestication and de-domestication provide resources and tools for epigenetic breeding and sustainable agriculture. A pan-DNA methylome of rice uncovers reversal of DNA methylation changes during domestication and de-domestication.

AB  - Environmental policy development in 30 advanced and developing countries is examined using the capacity-building approach. Findings indicate that an appropriate mix of institutions is decisive for policy performance and that formal institutionalization is helpful for longer term policy-learning processes. Globalization is not found to be negative, as often claimed: Rather, the globalization of environmental policies and proponents counteracts ecologically ignorant economic interests and fosters diffusion a environmental innovations. Assistance from international organizations and regimes plays an increasingly critical role. Environmental and politico-administrative reforms appear to be mutually supportive. Democratic structures and institutions are a basic precondition for effective environmental policies. Although many countries have been able to achieve environmental gains from new technologies, policies, and forms of stakeholder cooperation. even the most advanced need to strongly increase environmental policy and management capacities to meet the continuing challenge of sustainable development.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) uses highly powerful computers to mimic human intelligent behavior; it is a major research hotspot in science and technology, with an increasing number of applications to a wider range of fields, including complex process supervision and control. Wastewater treatment is an example of a complex process involving many uncertainties and external factors to achieve a final product with specific requisites (effluents with prescribed quality). Reducing process energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and resources recovery are additional requirements of these facilities' operation. AI could extend the purpose and the expected results of previously adopted tools and present operational approaches by leveraging superior simulation, prediction, control, and adaptation capabilities. This paper reviews current AI research in the wastewater field and discusses present achievements and potentials. So far, almost all applications in the sector involve predictive studies, often at a small scale or with limited data use. Frontline research aimed at the creation of AI-supported digital twins of real systems is being conducted, with few encouraging but still limited applications. This paper aims at identifying and discussing key barriers to wider AI adoption in the field, which include laborious instrumentation maintenance, lack of process expertise in the design of current software, instability of control loops, and insufficient incentives for resource efficiency achievement.

AB  - Peri-urban Satoyama forests in Japan provide multiple or bundles of cultural ecosystem services (CES), yet, visitors' perceptions of CES are not well established. There is a need to explore these perceptions in order to provide comprehensive information to forest managers. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by exploring the profiles of visitors of peri-urban Satoyama forests and their perceived importance of CES using a landscape value (LV) typology table. Nine LVs of Kaisho Forest in Aichi, Japan were assessed using face-to-face questionnaires on socio-demographic variables, forest use, and a photograph-based approach, which were analyzed using descriptive statistics, quantitative cross-tabulation, multiple response analyses, and geocoding. Results showed that the forest is visited mostly by married elderly people from Aichi Prefecture who were engaged in forest bathing or birdwatching. Forest use patterns, like frequency, duration of the visit, and group size, presented a significant relation to demographic variables, like marital status or gender. Furthermore, the study showed how visitors ' LV perceptions were weighted towards natural and aesthetic values. The sociocultural Satoyama forest elements displayed a more detailed value perception where recreational, therapeutic, spiritual, cultural-historic, and educational values were also assigned. The LV perception enhances a comprehensive description of the perceived positive effects of visiting such forests. Hence, we concluded that visitors gain positive effects on mental and emotional health and spirituality as part of CES. Forest managers can reflect and accommodate diverse landscape value typology as a tool for monitoring visitors' perceptions.

AB  - Background: There has been growing interest in the development of waste-specific decay factors for estimation of greenhouse gas emissions from landfills in national greenhouse gas inventories. Although engineered wood products (EWPs) and paper represent a substantial component of the solid waste stream, there is limited information available on their carbon dynamics in landfills. The objective of this study was to determine the extent of carbon loss for EWPs and paper products commonly used in Australia. Experiments were conducted under laboratory conditions designed to simulate optimal anaerobic biodegradation in a landfill. Results: Methane generation rates over incubations of 307-677 days ranged from zero for medium-density fibreboard (MDF) to 326 mL CH4 g(-1) for copy paper. Carbon losses for particleboard and MDF ranged from 0.7 to 1.6%, consistent with previous estimates. Carbon loss for the exterior wall panel product (2.8%) was consistent with the expected value for blackbutt, the main wood type used in its manufacture. Carbon loss for bamboo (11.4%) was significantly higher than for EWPs. Carbon losses for the three types of copy paper tested ranged from 72.4 to 82.5%, and were significantly higher than for cardboard (27.3-43.8%). Cardboard that had been buried in landfill for 20 years had a carbon loss of 27.3%-indicating that environmental conditions in the landfill did not support complete decomposition of the available carbon. Thus carbon losses for paper products as measured in bioreactors clearly overestimate those in actual landfills. Carbon losses, as estimated by gas generation, were on average lower than those derived by mass balance. The low carbon loss for particleboard and MDF is consistent with carbon loss for Australian wood types described in previous studies. A factor for carbon loss for combined EWPs and wood in landfills in Australia of 1.3% and for paper of 48% is proposed. Conclusions: The new suggested combined decay factor for wood and EWPs represents a significant reduction from the current factor used in the Australian greenhouse gas inventory; whereas the suggested decay factor for paper is similar to the current decay factor. Our results improve current understanding of the carbon dynamics of harvested wood products, and allow more refined estimates of methane emissions from landfills.

AB  - Indonesia is the country with the greatest potential for sago in the world. This research is intended to determine the carbon footprint of sago starch produced from a semi-mechanical process. The calculation was carried out using the LCA approach with the system boundary of cradle to gate. The process steps were carried out in a combination of manual work and diesel-driven engines. The inventory data on material, energy input flows and emissions were obtained from 3 samples of typical medium-scale semi-mechanical sago mills. It was found that the carbon footprint of the sago produced from semi-mechanical processes was 37.9 +/- 0.6 kgCO(2)eq per 1 ton of dried sago starch. Further analysis shows that 62% of the carbon footprint comes from the extraction stage and 38% from the transportation. It can be estimated that the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from the semi-mechanical sago starch production in Indonesia for 2018 reached around 2,617,639 kg CO(2)eq.

AB  - Against the backdrop of global climate change, corporate carbon emissions have increasingly become a focal point, making carbon reduction by companies a pivotal issue. Based on data from Chinese listed manufacturing companies from 2010 to 2020, this paper explores the impact of ESG performance on carbon reduction. The results indicate that ESG performance significantly reduce corporate carbon emissions. Green technology innovation, corporate efficiency, and managerial short-sightedness are vital channels through which ESG promotes corporate carbon reduction. For companies with different environmental regulations, industry competition intensities, and capital intensities, the relationship between ESG performance and carbon reduction varies significantly. Notably, we found that in companies with strict environmental regulations, intense industry competition, and high capital intensity, the carbon-reducing effect of ESG performance is more pronounced. Furthermore, digital transformation positively moderates the relationship between ESG performance and carbon reduction. This study not only provides new empirical evidence for understanding the impact of ESG performance on carbon reduction but also offers valuable insights for businesses and policymakers to promote corporate efforts in carbon reduction and achieve China's "Dual Carbon" goals.

AB  - Carbon sequestration is a new technology that is gaining importance in combating the harmful effects of global warming. The potential for carbon sequestration from domestic sewage treatment plants operating in India was studied. Based on the data provided by the Government of India on the generation of domestic sewage by State, the organic load generation, sequestration potential and net release of CO2 were calculated. By going in for carbon sequestration, domestic sewage treatment in India has a potential to be a carbon neutral sector with a capacity to store 22 thousand tonnes of CO2 every day at current levels. The Government of India's focus is on increasing the share of renewable energy sources to combat emissions; however, carbon sequestration technology would be an ideal solution for deployment over the time period required for renewable energy' share to become significant. Three metro cities, viz., Delhi, Mumbai, and Chennai are immediate prospects that could adopt this technology, followed by other cities. The prevalent Renewable Energy Credit Trading Scheme in India can support carbon sequestration technology infusion. (c) 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 36: 162-170, 2017

AB  - With over 2 billion metric tons generated annually, global solid waste production has severe environmental consequences. Although it is not a primary Sustainable Development Goal, effective solid waste management (SWM) is vital for meeting targets 11.6, 12.4, and 12.5. South Africa, in particular, deals with significant SW generation and inadequate collection services. Therefore, this paper presents an Urban Digital Twin (UDT) prototype to tackle these issues, involving stakeholder prioritization, integrating real-time monitoring, citizen participation, waste generation simulations, optimized collection routes, and a control Dashboard where stakeholders' system requirements were included. The UDT proposes optimized collection routes to reduce fuel use, operational costs, and emissions. The stakeholders' opinions on the usefulness of the UDT varied due to their backgrounds and skills. Most of them appreciated the Dashboard visualization and the UDT possibilities for resource optimization. The performance of the UDT depends on computer capacity and local or online processing. This UDT prototype sets the foundation for digital twinning in SWM, scalable to different areas, vehicles, and production levels. The proposed approach, citizen involvement, and multi-stakeholder engagement enhance the SWM, benefiting resource-limited countries.

AB  - Self-driving automobiles have emerged as the future of vehicular travel, but this innovation is not developing in isolation. Simultaneously, the popularity of transportation network companies functioning as ride-hailing and ride-sharing services have altered traditional conceptions of personal transportation. Technology companies, conventional automakers, and start-up businesses each play significant roles in fundamentally transforming transportation methods. These transformations raise numerous liability questions. Specifically, the emergence of self-driving vehicles and transportation network companies create uncertainty for the application of tort law's negligence standard. This Note addresses technological innovations in vehicular transportation and their accompanying legislative and regulatory developments. Then, this Note discusses the implications for vicarious liability for vehicle owners, duties of care for vehicle operators, and corresponding insurance regimes. This Note also considers theoretical justifications for tort concepts including enterprise liability. Accounting for the inevitable uncertainty in applying tort law to new invention, this Note proposes a strict and vicarious liability regime with corresponding no-fault automobile insurance.

AB  - 1. We sometimes need to predict the maximum number of bird-days that can be supported by the food supply in a site used by migratory birds outside the breeding season. So defined, carrying capacity is often estimated using the daily ration model (DRM). In this, the total biomass of accessible food, aggregated across all patches of differing food density, is divided by an individual's daily requirement. Carrying capacity can also be estimated using spatial depletion models (SDM), in which patches of differing food density are treated separately. We identify here some of the features of the food supply that enable patches to be amalgamated so that the very simple DRM can be used instead of a more complex SDM. 2. We show by theoretical modelling that the predictions of the DRM and SDM are often the same even though initial food density varies between patches. The wide range of conditions over which this is so are specified. 3. A DRM and a SDM of wildfowl eating seagrass Zostera spp. in a nature reserve produced similar predictions for the number of bird-days supported intertidally before the birds switched to farmland. 4. We conclude that a DRM can often be used instead of a SDM to predict bird-day carrying capacity. We identified two conditions in which the DRM cannot be used: (i) when the rate of additional food loss due to factors other than depletion by the birds themselves differs between patches; and (ii) when the relative profitabilities of patches, and thus the number of birds using each patch, change through the depletion period in non-simple ways that cannot be predicted without a SDM. Examples of such exceptions are described. 5. Synthesis and applications. By showing when a DRM can be used instead of a SDM, this study should help nature managers to predict the bird-day carrying capacity of a site in the simplest way yet available. However, predicting the maximum number of bird-days supported is not equivalent to predicting demographic rates and should not be confused with predictions for population size. Rather, it is probably best regarded as a measure of site quality.

AB  - Recent efforts to generate renewable energy on a local scale and distributed basis have resulted in renewed interest in converting municipal solid waste (MSW) to energy. In addition, U.S. MSW generation has increased from about 1.1 tons per capita in 1990 to 1.3 tons in 2002, and worldwide, MSW generation is projected to double by 2030. Furthermore, many countries have established very strict limits on materials suitable for landfilling such as completely banning organic material from entering landfills. Typical MSW contains approximately 2800 kWh of heating content and is capable of yielding nearly 700 kWh of electricity in modern waste to energy (WTE) facilities. The composition of MSW has been demonstrated to be about 66% biogenic, thus today's modern WTE facilities avoid 30 million tons per year of CO2 equivalent by avoiding CO2 from fossil fuel power plants and methane from landfills. Finally, research data shows that regions employing WTE facilities have a higher recycling rate. Therefore, increasing the usage of WTE facilities worldwide has the potential to satisfy a large part of the global energy demand while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and providing a safe waste disposal option. This paper will describe the current situation worldwide with some focus on the U.S. Some description and discussion on the dominant technology, mass burn, as well as other next generation technologies will be included. While all WTE emissions are well below regulations, particular emphasis will be placed on emission reduction schemes and potential for future advancement such as optimal pre-shredding, oxygen enhancement and conversion of MSW to fuels.

AB  - Purpose - The clean development mechanism (CDM) provides industrialized countries with an incentive to invest in emission reduction projects in developing countries to achieve a reduction in CO2 emissions at lowest cost that also promotes sustainable development in the host country. Windmill pumps could be of interest under the CDM because they directly displace greenhouse gas emissions while contributing to sustainable rural development. This study aims to assess the maximum theoretical as well as the realistically achievable CDM potential of windmill pumps in India. Design/methodology/approach - To estimate the CDM potential of windmill pumps in case of electricity replacement (by the substitution of electric motor pumps) regional baseline(s) has been used whereas in case of diesel replacement (by the substitution of diesel engine pumps) the IPCC emission factor(s) has been used. The authors have analyzed the financial feasibility of five designs of windmill pumps at ten select locations in India to justify the financial additionality of windmill pump-based CDM projects. To analyze the future dissemination levels of windmill pumps logistic growth model has been used. Findings - The annual CO2 emissions mitigation potential through windmill pumps in India could theoretically reach five million tones. Under more realistic assumptions about diffusion of windmill pumps based on past experiences with the government-run programmes, annual CER volumes by 2012 could reach 13,000-46,000 and 0.07-0.3 million by 2020. This would require that the government sets the subsidy level for windmill pumps at a level that allows them to become viable with the CER revenue. From a macro-economic point of view, this makes sense if the sustainability benefits are deemed sufficiently high to warrant promotion of this project type. Originality/value - The paper illustrates the vast theoretical potential of CO2 mitigation by using windmill pumps for irrigation water pumping in India.

AB  - Social scientists and psychologists who study environmental issues need to improve their measures to capture relevant pro-environmental behaviors to reduce greenhouse gas emissions - the main driver of climate change. They also need to identify meaningful predictors for these behaviors, which go beyond mere statistical significance. In this large representative study of the Austrian population (N = 1,083), we aim at addressing both issues. We focus on relevant and specific energy-related behavioral intentions (traveling, electricity consumption and heating) and test a set of preregistered social-psychological predictors in path models, followed by an exploratory machine-learning approach. We show that a combination of some prominent predictors - perceived behavior control, consideration of future and immediate consequences, and willingness to sacrifice - accounts for only 20 to 30% of variance in behavioral intentions. We suggest that future studies confirm our results in other cultures and set even higher qualitative benchmarks for measures and predictors.

AB  - Spatially explicit land-use change prediction is often based on environmental characteristics of land-use types, such as soil type and slope, as observed at one time instant. This approach presumes that relationships between land use and environment are constant over time. We argue that such temporal stationarity is uncommon in many land-use systems, and we demonstrate by means of a case study how this may affect the performance of land-use change inference. For this purpose, the spatial distribution of cropland and uncultivated land in Mediterranean Europe in 2000 was studied, as well as recent land-use changes from cropland to uncultivated land and vice versa between 1990 and 2000. Both land-use and land-use change frequencies were captured in regression equations that related them to environmental characteristics. A comparison between these two regression types suggests that many traditional constraints (slope, soil quality, accessibility) have become less important, while climatic variables have gained importance. These results can be explained by lower costs of constraints due to technological and economic developments, and by changes in relative average revenues of different land uses.

AB  - The development of hydrokinetic turbines has been motivated by the desire to reduce fossil fuel reliance, energy production costs, and greenhouse gas emissions. Detailed information about fish interactions with hydrokinetic turbines is limited; therefore, this study sought to characterize the interactions between a turbine (RivGen; Ocean Renewable Power Company) and Sockeye Salmon Oncorhynchus nerka from one of the most productive populations in the world-that in the Kvichak River, Alaska. By viewing real-time video imagery, our objectives were to quantify the number of Sockeye Salmon smolts that interacted with the turbine and to assess the behaviors/outcomes of these interactions during the species' smolt out-migration. From May 21 to June 10, 2021, a total of 2,374 Sockeye Salmon smolts passed through the field of view of cameras placed immediately downstream of the hydrokinetic turbine. The majority of these observed events occurred over a short (5-d) time period from late May to early June during periods of darkness (0000-0400 hours). Fish were observed passing through the hydrokinetic turbine in both normal and disoriented manners, with the rotational status/speed of the hydrokinetic turbine appearing to influence passage behavior. Blade strikes on fish were also observed, all of which occurred when the turbine was rotating at high "production" speeds. After temporally and spatially extrapolating the observed fish interactions to account for our subsampling, the results suggest that when monitoring was conducted, the hydrokinetic turbine interacted with approximately 200,000 Sockeye Salmon smolts during this species' smolt out-migration period. This study adds to the sparse knowledge base on fish interactions with emerging riverine hydrokinetic devices and may inform strategies to mitigate the impacts of developing energy projects on socially and culturally important fisheries.

The case analysed will be the art scene of the city of Malmo, its policies and metrological devices, with a focus on one community theatre project as an exemplary case. The metrologies, we claim, are the ways in which the policy apparatus opens up to larger concerns of what Michel Foucault calls dispositifs, linking art policy to other policy changes and societal concerns in general, and making art respond to those concerns in managed ways.

AB  - Growing social concerns over the environmental externalities associated with business activities are pushing firms to identify activities that create economic value with less environmental impact and to become more eco-efficient. Over the past two decades, researchers have increasingly used frontier efficiency models to evaluate productive efficiency in the presence of undesirable outputs, such as greenhouse gas emissions or toxic emissions. In this paper, we identify critical flaws in existing frontier models and show that these models can identify eco-inefficient firms as eco-efficient. We develop a new eco-inefficiency frontier model that rectifies these problems. Our model calculates an eco-inefficiency score for each firm and improvements in outputs necessary to attain eco-efficiency. We demonstrate through a Monte Carlo experiment that our eco-inefficiency model provides a more reliable measurement of corporate eco-inefficiency than the existing frontier models. We also extend the single-output Cobb-Douglas production function to multiple desirable and undesirable outputs. This extension allows for greater flexibility in the simulation analysis of frontier models.

AB  - Purpose - In the era of climate change, industrial organizations are under increasing pressure from consumers and regulators to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effectiveness of product mix as a strategy to deliver the low carbon supply chain under the cap-and-trade policy. Design/methodology/approach - The authors incorporate the cap-and-trade policy into the green product mix decisionmodels by using game-theoretic approach and compare these decisions in a decentralizedmodel and a centralized model, respectively. The research explores potential behavioral changes under the cap-and-trade in the context of a two-echelon supply chain. Findings - The analysis results show that the channel structure has significant impact on both economic and environmental performances. An integrated supply chain generates more profits. In contrast, a decentralized supply chain has lower carbon emissions. The cap-and-trade policy makes a different impact on the economic and environmental performances of the supply chain. Balancing the trade-offs is critical to ensure the long-term sustainability. Originality/value - The research offers many interesting observations with respect to the effect of product mix strategy on operational decisions and the trade-offs between costs and carbon emissions under the cap-and-trade policy. The insights derived from the analysis not only help firms to make important operational and strategic decisions to reduce carbon emissions while maintaining their economic competitiveness, but also make meaningful contribution to governments' policy making for carbon emissions control.

AB  - Photocatalytic CO2 reduction can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and convert CO2 into value-added chemical feedstocks and fuels. P25 is one of the most popular photocatalyst, but its high photoinduced charge recombination rate and low CO2 adsorption ability hinder its application in photocatalytic CO2 reduction due to the limited anatase/rutile interface and small specific surface area. Herein, a paragenetic anatase/rutile interface is in-situ formed in one crystal grain via calcination of NH2-MIL-125 in argon atmosphere and the obtained N doped porous carbon layer endows its high specific surface area. The in situ XRD and HRTEM characterization proved the anatase/rutile interface is in situ formed by the phase transformation from anatase (211) plane to rutile (211) plane. The charge separation efficiency of the photocatalyst with N-doped carbon coating paragenetic heterostructure is proved to be enhanced compared with N-doped carbon coating anatase or rutile single phase catalyst. The optimized catalyst S-750Ar with paragenetic anatase/rutile structure shows a 7.6 folds enhanced CO conversion rate than that of P25. These findings provide an in-situ self-transition strategy to regulate charge transfer between phases at the interface and promote the application of heterogeneous catalysts.

AB  - CO2 injection into coal seams can not only enhance the recovery of coalbed methane, but also achieve the goal of CO2 geological sequestration, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. CO2 is likely to be stored in the form of supercritical state, when the burial depth of coal seams exceeds 800 m. However, the existing knowledge is still lacking regarding how supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) reacts with coal. In this work, alterations of pore structure and mineral compositions induced by SC-CO2 interactions have been explored. The results show that coal pore volume and porosity are greatly increased after SC-CO2 interactions, which contributes to the increase of gas adsorption. A comparison of pore fractal dimension has been made between raw coal and treated samples, suggesting that SC-CO2 interaction can enhance pore roughness and structure complexity. XRD analysis indicates that mineral content within coal is remarkably changed after SC-CO2 saturation. Carbonate minerals are sensitive to SC-CO2 fluids, and mineral consumption plays a key role in pore alterations. There are multiple effects of SC-CO2 fluids on both mineral compositions and pore distribution. Mineral dissolution, differential swelling, hydrocarbon extraction and migration account for the variations of coal microstructures and mineral content. The increase in pore volume and structure complexity of coal seams after interaction is quite favorable for CO2 adsorption and storage. This result provides powerful support for CO2 geological sequestration and CO2-ECBM. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Healthy and sustainable urban agglomerations development relies heavily on land use optimization. However, there is insufficient scientific basis and reliable quantitative analysis for land use pattern identification and optimal prediction in embryonic urban agglomeration. Therefore, taking the Lanzhou-Xining (LX) region, a typical primary developing urban agglomeration, as the study area, we first assessed the land ecological suitability (LES). Then, we embedded the LES evaluation results in the land optimization process and constructed the MCR-MOP- Dyna-CLUE model framework, simulating and optimizing land use patterns for the year 2035 under ecological optimization and business as usual scenarios, which aimed to explore a sustainable land use pattern for embryonic urban agglomerations. The results indicated that the ecological optimization scenario based on LES had a more rational land use pattern. It appropriately controlled the expansion rate of construction land and effectively alleviated the problems of construction land encroaching on farming land and ecological land. Meanwhile, the ecosystem services increased in value based on adequately addressing the need for food security and economic development. Compared to the business as usual scenario, the construction land under the ecological optimization scenario was 19,622.69 ha less, and the cultivated land was 32,103.29 ha more. Moreover, the ecological benefit and the economic benefit increased by 187,490.4595 million yuan and 151,808,605.1 million yuan from 2020 to 2035, respectively, under the ecological optimization scenario. Our research is of great value for making decisions on sustainable land use and land resource management in initial developing agglomerations.

AB  - Electric vehicles are becoming increasingly prevalent as an effective solution to reduce resource scarcity and greenhouse gas emissions. As the core component of electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) play a crucial role in energy storage and conversion. When LIBs are used in long-term service, it is essential to carefully consider the impact of modeling methods on both the environmental benefits and burdens associated with their usage. In this study, eight calculation models are chosen, and multiple environmental impacts of battery usephase are compared based on life cycle assessment. The application of different computational models produced widely varying results, and previous conclusions regarding the environmental impacts of battery usage need to be revisited. Moreover, the different models during the battery use-phase exhibits an outstanding contribution to the life cycle carbon footprint and midpoint indicators. Sensitivity analysis reveals that battery efficiency is the most sensitive parameter to environmental indicators during use. Environmental impacts during the battery use-phase should consider the characteristics of different models to ensure the reliability and comparability of the study.

AB  - Carbon related taxation is viewed as a cost-effective price instrument to charge for greenhouse gas emissions, creating certainty costs for economic agents. The costs will naturally influence the market competitiveness. In this paper, we propose the concept of an equivalent emission standard (EES) tax as a complement to traditional standards, linking the tax rate to the abatement cost for firms under the optimal carbon emission standard and providing tax revenue for the government. To study the optimal carbon related regulation mode and the relevant impacts in oligopoly, we compare four potential carbon related regulations: an emission tax (an emission approach tax), a carbon tax (a fuel approach tax), an emission standard and an EES tax. Incorporating a sequential game analysis, we show that policy effects are relevant to the magnitude of carbon pollution and the abatement cost in the short term. In general, the optimal levels of social welfare under emission tax and carbon tax modes are the same. Notably, the EES tax system can not only generate tax revenue but also has a relatively moderate impact on social welfare. If the social damage resulting from carbon emissions is large, the EES tax system will be comparatively more beneficial to society, but the advantage is limited in terms of the relevant abatement cost. In the long term, under certain conditions, excessive firm entry may occur. As a result, carbon related regulation can be an indirect instrument of entry deterrence in the market.

AB  - Introduction The implementation of energy-consuming right trading (ECRT) policy in 2017 is a major measure to promote the construction of ecological civilization and green development, which also aligns with the global trend towards sustainable energy management and carbon emission reduction.Methods Based on energy consumption data in China from 2010 to 2021, this paper utilizes the Difference-in-Differences (DID) method to assess the extent and process of the impact of energy consuming right trading policy on the low-carbon transition of the energy structure. The transmission mechanism of industrial structure upgrading and the new-quality productive forces in the impact process was discussed, and the regulatory role of environmental regulations was tested.Results The findings indicate: 1) ECRT has a strong driving effect on the low-carbon transition of the energy structure. 2) ECRT can promote low-carbon transition of the energy structure through the dual channel of promoting industrial structure upgrading and new quality productive forces. 3) The influence of ECRT on the low-carbon transition of the energy structure is different in different regions, and the higher degree of industrial agglomeration and renewable energy-rich regions are more significantly promoted by new quality productivity. 4) Environmental regulation has a significant positive moderating effect on the relationship between ECRT and low-carbon transition of the energy structure. 5) Furthermore, the exploratory analysis reveals that the positive impacts of ECRT policies on the low-carbon Transition of the energy structure translates into higher green total factor productivity and lower environmental pollution, which promotes the sustainable development of the low-carbon Transition of the energy structure.Discussion This paper responds to the basic question of whether energy use rights policies can promote the low-carbon Transition of the energy structure, and provides empirical evidence and policy reference not only for the development of China's environmental policy and the direction of energy consumption but also for the international community's efforts in sustainable energy and environmental governance.

AB  - We carefully utilize empirical methods and measurement, and find that the effect of human capital on China's economic growth may be indirect through physical capital investment. This result is different than that found for OECD countries and has not been suggested by previous studies. In addition, in determining physical capital investment, workers with college education play a more significant role than those with primary and secondary education, suggesting the possibility of capital-skill complementarity. This finding has implications for China's future regional growth inequality: the inequality may increase rather than decrease, because physical capital investment continues to accumulate faster in the eastern area where the human capital stock is larger and thus leads to greater economic growth in the east.

AB  - Over the past few decades, Vietnam has been one of the fastest growing economies in Asia, experiencing a GDP growth rate of more than 6% per year. The energy industry plays an important role in Vietnam's continuous development, so access to reliable and low-cost energy sources will be an important factor for sustainable economic growth. Achieving the goal of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, as set out in the Paris agreement on climate change, will depend heavily on the development roadmap of emerging economies, such as Vietnam. Currently, developing hydroelectric plants is Vietnam's optimal choice in order to meet its target of renewable energy development. Hydroelectricity in Vietnam is favorable thanks to the high average annual rainfall, about 1800-2000 mm, and the dense river system, with more than 3450 systems. In addition to providing electricity, hydropower plants are also responsible for cutting and fighting floods for downstream areas in the rainy season, at the same time providing water for production and people's daily needs in the dry season. This work proposes the application of a multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) model to select the best option for the installation of river hydroelectric plants in Vietnam. The use of MCDM techniques in environmental decision-making, including selecting between various alternatives, is important when this involves complex decisions in several disciplinary fields. The most widely used of these techniques are the fuzzy analytical network process (FANP) and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). As a result, Nghe An (LOC05) is found to be the optimal solution for selecting river portions where hydroelectric plants are viable in Vietnam.

AB  - The present study represents findings from interviews with five mothers, each of whom had a transgender child. All of the transgender children were natal/biological males between the ages of 8 and 11 years old and had socially transitioned to living as girls. Ehrensaft's (2012) notion of the "true gender self" was integrated with an ecological perspective to examine multiple interacting contexts, including family, neighborhood, and school, in which the participants lived. An overarching theme of "transformation" (or lack thereof) was used to organize the findings in relation to the transgender children, their families, and their communities. Changes in relation to the children's demeanor and well-being before and after their social transitions (e.g., from shy and depressed to happy and well-adjusted), the parents' and other family members' feelings and reactions to the children's gender identities and expressions over time (e.g., health care professionals and school staff learning along with and from the families), and the responses of others in the community (e.g., lack of knowledgeable health care professionals and school personnel) are discussed. Findings have implications for practice and future research.

AB  - Energy and water have become major factors limiting sustainable development in China. Energy efficiency and optimization of water management are critical for the healthy growth of the Chinese economy, Current national energy policies fail to adequately address water use issues. Similarly, current water policies do not consider the impact of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, few studies have investigated the relationship between energy consumption and water use. The present study analyzes the energy-water nexus in Chinese industries using input-output tables. Coefficients that characterize the relationship between energy consumption and water are used to describe the supply-consumption relationship between the water supply and primary energy sectors. Next, we calculate the water-saving effects associated with the enforcement of energy-saving policies in selected industrial sectors during the eleventh Five-year Plan, from 2005 to 2010. These calculations address the ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, petrochemical engineering, building materials, and electricity industries as well as key light industries. Our findings indicate that energy-saving efforts in these industries will result in savings in water consumption. This study suggests that a cooperative relationship between water and energy conservation efforts should be an important factor in creating policies that encourage simultaneous savings of both resources. Additionally, the study indicates that government should promote water- and energy-saving techniques in key industrial sectors to encourage cooperative water and energy conservation.

AB  - China's great ascendancy from a poor agrarian economy to an economic superpower is unprecedented. But in the process, structural imbalances, resource inefficiency, and income inequality worsened rapidly. It is argued that the coexistence of China's extraordinary growth and serious structural risks are two sides of the same coin: asymmetric liberalisation of product and factor markets. Distortions in markets for labour, capital, land, energy, and the environment lower production costs, increase corporate profits, raise investment returns, improve the international competitiveness of Chinese goods, and therefore lift China's growth. But they also depress consumption. China needs to accelerate factor market liberalisation in order to complete the transition to a market economy and to lock the economy onto a more sustainable path.

AB  - Pro-poor growth has been the preeminent strategic framework of the international development community because it describes relationships between growth, inequality, and poverty. Assessing whether economic growth and income distributional changes are "pro-poor" has important policy implications and has become increasingly widespread in academic and policy societies. The article aims to measure the pro-poor growth in rural China from 1989 to 2009 through analyzing the household survey data collected by the China Health and Nutrition Survey. Among the main findings, from 1989 to 2006, China's economic growth in rural areas was relatively weakly pro-poor and poverty reduction mainly relied on the "trickle-down effect" of economic growth. However, since 2006, both the "trickle-down effect" of growth and changes in income distribution have reduced poverty. During this period, Chinese economic growth was pro-poor. Research on pro-poor growth based on more comprehensive data is urgently needed to advise policymakers tomake relevant policies.

AB  - During the recent four decades since 1980, a series of modern climate satellites were launched, allowing for the measurement and record-keeping of multiple climate parameters, especially over the polar regions where traditional observations are difficult to obtain. China has been actively engaging in polar expeditions. Many observations were conducted during this period, accompanied by improved Earth climate models, leading to a series of insightful understandings concerning Arctic and Antarctic climate changes. Here, we review the recent progress China has made concerning Arctic and Antarctic climate change research over the past decade. The Arctic temperature increase is much higher than the global-mean warming rate, associated with a rapid decline in sea ice, a phenomenon called the Arctic Amplification. The Antarctic climate changes showed a zonally asymmetric pattern over the past four decades, with most of the fastest changes occurring over West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula. The Arctic and Antarctic climate changes were driven by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and ozone loss, while tropical-polar teleconnections play important roles in driving the regional climate changes and extreme events over the polar regions. Polar climate changes may also feedback to the entire Earth climate system. The adjustment of the circulation in both the troposphere and the stratosphere contributed to the interactions between the polar climate changes and lower latitudes. Climate change has also driven rapid Arctic and Southern ocean acidification. Chinese researchers have made a series of advances in understanding these processes, as reviewed in this paper.

AB  - The economic development literature widely concurs that conflicts have adverse economic consequences that contribute to poverty, disinvestment and lower human capital leading to widespread inequality and lower economic growth. As such, understanding the nature of conflict has been an important focus for political leaders, policymakers and researchers alike. However, the existing literature does not typically distinguish between the effects of conflict determinants on conflicts by type of actor or aggressor (i.e. state, group and civilian-based). Using panel data analysis for 46 African countries from 1997 to 2017, and a comprehensive geo-referenced Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED) conflict dataset, we find evidence of variation in the determinants' effects on conflicts by actor types. For the full sample of countries, we find that military expenditure decreases civilian-based conflicts; globalisation increases both state- and civilian-based conflicts while state fragility increases group-based conflicts. On the other hand, income per capita increases all three types of conflicts. At regional level, we find variation in the effects of military expenditure and globalisation on state- and civilian-based conflicts. However, we find little variation in the effects of the determinants on group-based conflicts across the regions. The findings highlight the nuances in conflicts by actor types and their causes which need to be accounted for when formulating conflict resolution policies.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine a relationship model between the variables of problem perception of solid waste management, public mind, servant leadership, happiness and well-being that affect the participatory behavior of the stakeholders regarding the solid waste management in Ratchaburi, a province of Thailand. The study sample included community enterprise members, tourism entrepreneurs, community leaders, staff of the local administrative organization and officers from related government agencies in the Ratchaburi province. In this study, 400 participants completed the questionnaires and 40 participants were interviewed. Validity, reliability and discrimination were assessed to measure the quality of the research instrument. Path analysis was used to test the proposed relationship model and content analysis was used to analyze the data from the interviews. The results showed that the most important factors affecting the participatory behavior of the stakeholders toward solid waste management were public mind, followed by problem perception of solid waste management, servant leadership, well-being and happiness. These variables accounted for 19 percent of the variance of participatory behavior of the stakeholders toward solid waste management. Happiness, wellbeing, public mind and servant leadership accounted for 43 percent of the variance of problem perception of solid waste management. The findings from this study suggest a psychological relationship model in order to promote participatory behavior toward solid waste management. Behavioral and socio-economic interventions for solid waste management are discussed.

AB  - With continued motorization and urbanization in Chinese cities, there is a growing demand for innovative transportation policies at the city level to address the challenges of congestion, local air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. Using Beijing and Shanghai as case studies, this paper draws on 32 in-depth semi-structured interviews with municipal government officials, academics, and transportation professionals to explore the city-level transportation policymaking process in Chinese megacities. Across the two cities, we identify three common contributors - policy learning, data informatization, and public opinion-and four obstacles-public complaint, unilateral decision-making, inadequate coordination among relevant departments, and lack of adaptiveness in policy implementation practice-to adopting timely and appropriate transportation policies. We then introduce a processual model that connects the contributors and obstacles identified within the flow of transportation policy among key actors in city-level government. This process shows how transportation policymaking in Chinese megacities is often reactive to public outcry over a transportation problem. This problem is investigated by a technical government research center that reports to the municipal transport committee. This committee then assesses public opinion and submits a policy recommendation to city government leadership, who make the final policy decision. Based on both case studies, we discuss potential recommendations for how to better enable transportation policymaking at the city level in China through more formalized processes of policy experimentation and public participation. We conclude with a discussion of limitations and areas of future research.

AB  - European countries strive to provide people with a timely and appropriate access to care. Different models and approaches are implemented for this purpose. Whilst scholars have proposed various taxonomies to point out the peculiarities of health system types, little is known about patients' satisfaction with the health services provided by such systems. This prevents a vision of the future of health care. The article intends to fill this gap through an empirical analysis of secondary data collected from the Eurofound's database. Adhering to the taxonomy developed by Reibling and colleagues (2019), we investigated the performances of health systems types in terms of: 1) perceived quality of health services; 2) affordability of health care; 3) satisfaction with primary care; 4) satisfaction with secondary care; and 5) equity in the provision of care. Findings suggested that countries characterized by a thin access regulation and imposing a cost-sharing mechanism outperformed other health system types. Countries adopting a national health service scheme implying a strict access regulation and limited cost sharing were considered to be unfair. Health systems' economic and social sustainability relies on the policy makers' ability to stress the strengths of existing health system types, overcoming their weaknesses in terms of equitable and timely access to care. The future of health care will benefit from a contamination of existing health system types, which may lead to hybrid models able to merge fairness with financial sustainability.

Thus, the sector can play a crucial role in decarbonisation and hence in achieving a zero-emissions future in response to climate change. A CE aims to harmonise economic growth with environmental protection and is based on the concept of closing the loop with minimal practical waste as in a natural ecosystem. The adoption of CE concepts is therefore seen as a feasible response to climate change through the deployment of more sustainable construction processes that significantly reduce the need for natural resources by maximising recycling and reuse. However, and despite the recognition of the potential of a CE in relation to sustainability issues, the adoption of a CE model within building and construction sectors is challenging because of the wide range of aspects and priorities which are reflected in the diversity of definition resulting in a narrow and limited adoption. There are currently many definitions of CEs as related to building and construction in the literature, creating confusion and preventing effective implementation. The study presented here intends, using a comprehensive literature review as its basis, to define the key domains of a CE on which to align a concise and accurate definition that will enable effective application in the building and construction sectors. The research also aims to identify current research gaps and barriers to contribute to the future of CE research in the building sector and thus drive the implementation of CE projects to mitigate the effects of climate change and support the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by laying the foundations for a novel and forward-looking approach to circularity based on properly established, defined and understood principles of CEs.

AB  - Housing conditions form an important part of social stratification in many advanced industrial economies. The objective of this article is to determine the extent to which social stratification is linked to housing inequalities in the post-socialist Czech Republic; and how this relationship has evolved during the course of the economic transformation process. With the fall of socialism the country adopted a market economic system and the Czech society today has a higher level of social stratification and social stratification is similar to the patterns evident in advanced economies. Based on 'classical social stratification perspective' one would expect there to be a greater level of housing inequality and that changes in social stratification and housing inequality have exhibited a positive relationship. The evidence presented reveals that this relationship is too weak to fit with the main prediction of 'classical social stratification perspective'. However, the evidence also revealed that this situation is only a temporal result of unique state interventions that cannot be repeated due to the colossal cost or their unconstitutional nature in the future.

AB  - We empirically verify that the market capitalizations of coins and tokens in the cryptocurrency universe follow power-law distributions with significantly different values for the tail exponent falling between 0.5 and 0.7 for coins, and between 1.0 and 1.3 for tokens. We provide a rationale for this, based on a simple proportional growth with birth and death model previously employed to describe the size distribution of firms, cities, webpages, etc. We empirically validate the model and its main predictions, in terms of proportional growth (Gibrat's Law) of the coins and tokens. Estimating the main parameters of the model, the theoretical predictions for the power-law exponents of coin and token distributions are in remarkable agreement with the empirical estimations, given the simplicity of the model. Our results clearly characterize coins as being 'entrenched incumbents' and tokens as an 'explosive immature ecosystem', largely due to massive and exuberant Initial Coin Offering activity in the token space. The theory predicts that the exponent for tokens should converge to 1 in the future, reflecting a more reasonable rate of new entrants associated with genuine technological innovations.

AB  - The issue of climate has posed major and urgent challenges for the global community. The European Green Deal sets out a new growth strategy aimed at turning the European Union into a just and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient, and competitive economy, which will no longer generate net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Cities in this context are committed on several fronts to rapid adaptation to improve their resilience capacity. The historic centre is the most vulnerable part of a city, with a reduced capacity for adaptation, but also the densest of values, which increase the complexity of the challenge. This study proposes an integrated tool, Heuristic Planning Support System (HPSS), aimed at exploring green-blue strategies for the historic centre. The tool is integrated with classic Planning Support System (PSS), a decision process conducted from the perspective of heuristic approach and Geographic Information System (GIS). It comprises modules for technical assessment, environmental assessment Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), economic assessment Life Cycle Cost (LCC), Life Cycle Revenues (LCR), and Discounted Cash Flow Analysis (DCFA) extended to the life cycle of specific interventions, the Multi-Attribute Value Theory (MAVT) for the assessment of energy, environmental, identity, landscape, and economic values. The development of a tool to support the ecological transition of historic centres stems from the initiative of researchers at the University of Catania, who developed it based on the preferences expressed by a group of decision makers, that is, a group of local administrators, scholars, and professionals. The proposed tool supports the exploration of green-blue strategies identified by decision makers and the development of the plan for the historic district of Borgata di Santa Lucia in Syracuse.

Issue linkage is considered through increased R&D expenditures triggering improved technological innovations that advance energy efficiencies. Model calculations demonstrate that incentive.,,, exist for non-cooperating countries like the USA to join a climate control coalition if nations cooperate on technological innovations. Restrictions on trade Such as sanction mechanisms against non-cooperating Countries are not necessarily an incentive to join a coalition. Technological spillover effects lead to improved economic Situations and increased energy efficiencies in non-cooperating countries. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article investigates the relation between climate policy uncertainty and firm investment in China. We quantify climate policy uncertainty in China based on the news from two leading mainland newspapers: the Renmin Daily and the Guangming Daily. Using the sample of Chinese A-share companies from January 2003 to September 2021, we find robust evidence that firms exhibit lower levels of investment when facing to higher climate policy uncertainty. Specifically, we also show that this negative effect is more profound for state-owned enterprises, carbon-intensive enterprises, and enterprises with lower risk taking. The results also give evidence that the effect of climate policy uncertainty on firm investment can last up to three quarters and disappear within 1 year. Finally, we propose that investment irreversibility is plausible channel through which climate policy uncertainty discourages investment. Overall, these results shed light on the real effects of climate policy uncertainty and the determinants of investment.

AB  - Prompted with the ongoing and projected climate change, a wide range of cities have committed, not only to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions but also to implement different climate change adaptation measures. These measures serve to ensure the wellbeing of the urban population. In practice, however, the planning of realistic adaptation measures is a complex process. Prior to starting such endeavor, it may therefore be useful to explore the maximum potential benefit that can be gained through adaptation measures. In this work, simple, extreme yet realistic adaptation measures are proposed in terms of changes in albedo and vegetation fraction. The impact of these land-use scenarios is explored by use of the land surface model SURFEX on the summer climate in terms of heat waves and the urban heat island for the city of Brussels. This is done for different periods in the future using the greenhouse gas scenario RCP8.5.

AB  - Vibrio vulnificus is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen, occurring in warm low-salinity waters. V. vulnificus wound infections due to seawater exposure are infrequent but mortality rates are high (similar to 18%). Seawater bacterial concentrations are increasing but changing disease pattern assessments or climate change projections are rare. Here, using a 30-year database of V. vulnificus cases for the Eastern USA, changing disease distribution was assessed. An ecological niche model was developed, trained and validated to identify links to oceanographic and climate data. This model was used to predict future disease distribution using data simulated by seven Global Climate Models (GCMs) which belong to the newest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Risk was estimated by calculating the total population within 200 km of the disease distribution. Predictions were generated for different "pathways" of global socioeconomic development which incorporate projections of greenhouse gas emissions and demographic change. In Eastern USA between 1988 and 2018, V. vulnificus wound infections increased eightfold (10-80 cases p.a.) and the northern case limit shifted northwards 48 km p.a. By 2041-2060, V. vulnificus infections may expand their current range to encompass major population centres around New York (40.7 degrees N). Combined with a growing and increasingly elderly population, annual case numbers may double. By 2081-2100 V. vulnificus infections may be present in every Eastern USA State under medium-to-high future emissions and warming. The projected expansion of V. vulnificus wound infections stresses the need for increased individual and public health awareness in these areas.

AB  - The global increasing trend in total greenhouse gas emissions in recent decades has triggered the need for climate-related development financing. This study analyzes the effects of climate-related development mitigation finance and renewable energy consumption on greenhouse gas emissions in the Congo Basin. Using panel data from 2002 to 2020, panel regression estimates empirically reveal (1) a minimal significant increase in green-house gas emissions with respect to an increase in climate-related development mitigation finance (2) An in-crease in climate-related mitigation finance significantly promotes the consumption of renewable energy (3) An increase in renewable energy consumption reduces greenhouse gas emissions (4) An increase in renewable en-ergy consumption reduces the effect of climate-related mitigation finance on greenhouse emissions. This study suggest the continuous flow of climate-related development mitigation finance from donor countries and bodies to developing countries on a more regular basis and the putting in place of a mechanism that tracks climate funds to ensure that they are effectively used in generating renewable energies such as solar, hydroelectric, biomass, wind and geothermal energies.

AB  - Feedbacks within the climate-economy system are complex. The research analyzing the relationship between human activities and the climate is considerable, with particular focus on intra-system feedback effects: environmental tipping points, and climate-triggered social tipping points, like migration, to a lesser extent (Kopp et al., 2016; van Ginkel et al., 2018). Due to their cross-disciplinary nature (Guerrero et al., 2018), two-way interactions between the environment and society, whereby movement in either system can trigger inter-system feedbacks (Lade et al., 2013; Yletyinen et al., 2019) as humans respond to a changing environment thereby further changing the environment, have only recently received attention by a growing inter-disciplinary research community. With the aim of improving climate policy and its tools, such as the social cost of carbon, we describe these social-ecological system (SES) feedbacks and place them in the existing taxonomy for tipping points applied by mainstream climate-economy models. Drawing lessons from SES research and related interdisciplinary literature, we discuss the value of and method by which to modify social-cost integrated assessment models (SC-IAMs), like Nordhaus' Dynamic Integrated Climate Economy. As it is critical that climate policy include these risks to the stability of the climate-economy system, we conclude with a research agenda for the identification, quantification, and integration of climate-society feedbacks into SC-IAMs.

AB  - Human history is shaped by landmark discoveries in science and technology. However, across both time and space the rate of innovation is erratic: Periods of relative inertia alternate with bursts of creative science and rapid cascades of technological innovations. While the origins of the rise and fall in rates of discovery and innovation remain poorly understood, they may reflect adaptive responses to exogenously emerging threats and pressures. Here we examined this possibility by fitting annual rates of scientific discovery and technological innovation to climatic variability and its associated economic pressures and resource scarcity. In time-series data from Europe (1500-1900CE), we indeed found that rates of innovation are higher during prolonged periods of cold (versus warm) surface temperature and during the presence (versus absence) of volcanic dust veils. This negative temperature - innovation link was confirmed in annual time-series for France, Germany, and the United Kingdom (1901-1965CE). Combined, across almost 500 years and over 5,000 documented innovations and discoveries, a 0.5 degrees C increase in temperature associates with a sizable 0.30-0.60 standard deviation decrease in innovation. Results were robust to controlling for fluctuations in population size. Furthermore, and consistent with economic theory and micro-level data on group innovation, path analyses revealed that the relation between harsher climatic conditions between 1500-1900CE and more innovation is mediated by climate-induced economic pressures and resource scarcity.

AB  - Kidney autotransplantation is a surgical procedure with multiple indications and advancing technological approaches. Kidney autotransplantation is used to address complex kidney-related diseases including renal vascular lesions, ureteral diseases, tumors, loin pain-hematuria syndrome, and conditions affecting a solitary kidney or both kidneys. Renal artery lesions, including aneurysms and stenoses, often necessitate kidney autotransplantation in cases involving renal artery bifurcation or distant failure of endovascular repair. Complex ureteral lesions such as ureteral avulsions are commonly treated with kidney autotransplantation. Renal tumors, especially centrally located tumors or those involving the renal hilum, are treated using this technique while preserving renal function. It is worth emphasizing that this would be a rarely used last-resort technique in the modern era of minimally invasive nephron-sparing surgery. Kidney autotransplantation may be indicated for the rare condition of loin pain-hematuria syndrome when conservative measures fail. Additionally, individuals with solitary or bilateral kidney disease benefit from kidney autotransplantation to preserve their renal function. Traditional open-kidney autotransplantation involves renal extraction, workbench repair, and renal reimplantation. Technological advancements have introduced minimally invasive techniques including laparoscopic- and robot-assisted kidney autotransplantation, which reduce surgical trauma and recovery times. These techniques have shown promising outcomes, and robotic platforms have the potential to further reduce complications. In this study, we reviewed diverse indications and recent technological innovations in the field of kidney autotransplantation.

AB  - Characterizing the genomic landscape of cancers is a routine part of clinical care that began with the discovery of the Philadelphia chromosome and has since coevolved with genomic technologies. Genomic analysis of tumors at the nucleotide level using DNA sequencing has revolutionized the understanding of cancer biology and identified new molecular drivers of disease that have led to therapeutic advances and improved patient outcomes. However, the application of next-generation sequencing in the clinical laboratory has generally been limited until very recently to targeted analysis of selected genes. Recent technological innovations and reductions in sequencing costs are now able to deliver the long-promised goal of tumor whole-genome sequencing as a practical clinical assay.

AB  - Clonal evolution represents the natural process through which cancer cells continuously search for phenotypic advantages that enable them to develop and expand within microenvironmental constraints. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), clonal evolution underpins leukemic progression and therapeutic resistance, with differences in clonal evolutionary dynamics accounting for its characteristically diverse clinical course. The past few years have witnessed profound changes in our understanding of CLL clonal evolution, facilitated by a maturing definition of high-risk CLL and an increasing sophistication of next-generation sequencing technology. In this review, we offer a modern perspective on clonal evolution of high-risk CLL, highlighting recent discoveries, paradigm shifts and unresolved questions. We appraise recent advances in our understanding of the molecular basis of CLL clonal evolution, focusing on the genetic and non-genetic sources of intratumoral heterogeneity, as well as tumor-immune dynamics. We review the technological innovations, particularly in single-cell technology, which have fostered these advances and represent essential tools for future discoveries. In addition, we discuss clonal evolution within several contexts of particular relevance to contemporary clinical practice, including the settings of therapeutic resistance to CLL targeted therapy and immunotherapy, as well as Richter transformation of CLL to high-grade lymphoma.

AB  - The energy sector in India is highly dependent on coal as a fuel. At present, most of the domestically produced thermal coal is burned raw or after minimal beneficiation. This practice often results in higher operating and maintenance costs, poorer utilization efficiencies, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. To improve the prevailing conditions, the Government of India is taking steps to increase clean coal production by promoting the installation of coal preparation plants across the country. The identification of optimal separation densities and blending protocols for these precombustion cleaning facilities greatly influences the economics of the fuel supply chain and India's quest for additional low-cost energy. Traditionally, preparation plants have utilized float-sink (washability) data to determine suitable density separation set points for their processing circuits. Very often, these set points are based on the cumulative ash content required to meet contract specifications within India's bulk commodity coal markets. Unfortunately, the current study indicates that the optimal separation densities are largely independent of coal washability characteristics. This article demonstrates the use of micro-price optimization to identify optimal density set points that maximize coal production for Indian coal feedstocks. This fundamental optimization technique assigns a unit price to each particle passing through the coal supply chain. This approach is in sharp contrast to the prevailing practice that assigns bulk prices to piles/lots of mixed coal and rock. Case studies for 12 different coal samples from India showed that (1) the historic constant cumulative ash method for determining set points is suboptimal, (2) the separation density of all plants/circuits should be held near-constant irrespective of feed washabilities, and (3) misplacement of high-ash rock and low-ash coal must be prevented to avoid large reductions in the inherent worth of India's coal reserves.

AB  - Global mangrove loss is occurring from deforestation and extreme climatic events, but changes to the coastal carbon cycle following mangrove mortality and/or loss are not well understood. In 2015/2016, a massive climate-driven mangrove dieback event occurred over similar to 1000 km of Australian coastline. To assess carbon loss following mortality, carbon fluxes in adjacent living and dead forest areas were compared 8 and 20 months postforest dieback. Dead areas experienced an increase in soil CO2 efflux by similar to 189%, and a decrease in oceanic dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) outwelling of similar to 50% relative to living areas. DIC outwelling (predominantly carbonate alkalinity) and soil CO2 efflux accounted for 81% and 16% of losses from the living forest, in comparison to 51% and 47%, respectively, from the dead forest. The dieback drove a shift from a dominance of oceanic carbon outwelling to increased atmospheric CO2 emissions and decreased alkalinity exports. This shift was likely driven by increased oxygen sediment permeation and the loss of mangrove net primary productivity. Combining our new observations with literature data, we found a logarithmic relationship between soil carbon loss and time since mangrove loss. Using this relationship, we estimate ongoing global carbon losses from historical mangrove deforestation and dieback could be 13.7 +/- 9.4 Tg C yr(-1), which is eightfold higher than previous estimates and offsets global mangrove carbon burial by similar to 60%. Even if no future deforestation occurred, we estimate ongoing carbon losses to the atmosphere and ocean from current global mangrove losses of 27 Tg C over the next 30 yr.

AB  - Housing plays a significant role in impelling demand for natural resources and driving economic growth in high-income countries. Public policies, commercial prerogatives, and other inducements have encouraged construction and occupancy of ever-larger homes and this pattern has persisted in the face of decreasing household size, declining fertility, ageing populations, and increasing complexity of domestic relationships. This situation has created a perverse mismatch between available housing stocks and residential requirements. Additionally, imperatives to curtail greenhouse-gas emissions and to hasten progress on the United Nations 2030 Agenda demand new planning priorities. Building on the sufficiency turn in the field of sustainable consumption, this paper first formulates parameters for estimating an environmentally tenable and globally equitable amount of per person living area. It then highlights five emblematic cases of "space-efficient" housing. While acknowledging that prevalent spatial norms are evolving, the conclusion discusses the profound challenges of achieving a successful sustainable consumption transition.

AB  - The New Territories Small House Policy in Hong Kong has been controversial, in that the interests of male indigenous villagers in terms of housing are prioritized at the expense of the rest of the population. This colonial era policy, currently under the protection of the Basic Law, has profound implications on how rural land outside the village environs should be used, particularly so when development pressures are mounting. How planning control decisions on small house applications are made under these conditions, thus, becomes an important and timely policy research topic. This paper, thus, studies these decisions in Greenbelt zone (GB), Agriculture zone (AGR), and Unspecified zone (UNSP), between January 1st, 1990 and June 30th, 2017, using non-aggregate planning statistics. The findings show that the Town Planning Board (TPB) is more likely to reject small house applications that propose a larger site area for each small house in AGR and GB zones, but not those that essentially propose a small-scale small house development (i.e. up to 5 houses). Also, land-use policies in these three zones are found to vary geographically. Further, the TPB's decisions are flexible in that they are subject to other exogenous factors, such as housing policies and housing market conditions.

AB  - The American renaissance in nuclear energy - in part brought about by liberalization, competition and consolidation - is a good example of what can happen when a dedicated industry embraces change. Liberalization of the American electricity market underscores the economic and strategic value of nuclear energy. It has also helped bring to light how very competitive nuclear energy is compared with other forms of generation. As evidenced by the exciting trend toward license renewal, corporate leaders view nuclear power plants as valuable economic assets. Moreover, the strong public, policymaker and regulator support for license renewal is a strong indication that - to date - adding the functional equivalent of at least 25 new nuclear plants is viewed as an, energy and environmental imperative and we expect more plants to follow in the near future. Concern over greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution underscore nuclear energy's strategic value as a baseload capable, emission-free generation source. As these concerns grow in parallel with increased energy demand, nuclear energy will increasingly be valued as a national asset by the public and policymakers alike. Moreover, when monetized, nuclear energy's emission free-nature will lower substantially its already competitive generation cost.

AB  - Considering the rapid pace of global warming, it is crucial to decarbonize our energy supply to meet both electric power and thermal energy demands. This study evaluates the application of a combined cooling, heat, and power system for commercial applications in a maritime temperate climate to assess the feasibility of meeting thermal and electrical demand with medium-size commercial generators fueled with blends of hydrogen and natural gas. Demand load data analysis has been conducted using open-source datasets to identify building categories with representative thermal and electrical demands. A large hospital was chosen for a representative case study to define system component capacity and operation optimization to minimize estimated costs and greenhouse gas emissions. Along with the generator, the combined cooling, heat, and power system included thermal energy storage and an absorption cooler, supplemented with conventional boiler and an electric (vapor compression) cooling system. The optimized system was compared to a conventional combination of grid electrical supply for power; cooling from an electrical chiller; and heat load from a natural gas boiler. A hierarchical clustering al-gorithm was employed to identify five representative days to cover the entire year while keeping the optimi-zation tractable. The system was sized using nested optimization, where operation over the year was optimized for a given system component sizing, then the sizing was adjusted, and the operation re-optimized in an iterative process. This ensured that the final system specification was optimized for both component size (capacity) and operation. The results show that a combined cooling, heat, and power system can provide economic and greenhouse gas emissions benefits for electricity grids with marginal CO2 intensities greater than 230-260 g/ kWh. Adding up to 50% hydrogen to the natural gas can reduce this break-even intensity by up to 12%. Net cost savings on the order of 5% can also be achieved at the break-even greenhouse gases grid intensity. Depending on the grid CO2 intensity and fuel composition, combined cooling, heat, and power can save more than 14% compared to the conventional system in 20 years.

AB  - Extreme heat exposure has been associated with hypertension. However, its interactive influences with air pollution, green and blue spaces are unclear. This study aimed to explore the interaction between heatwaves, air pollution, green and blue spaces on hypertension. Cohort data enrolled 6448 Chinese older adults aged 65 years and over were derived from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) between 2008 and 2018. Nine heatwave defini-tions, combining three heat thresholds (92.5th, 95th, and 97.5th percentiles of daily maximum temperature) and three durations (>= 2, 3 and 4 days) were used as time-varying variables in the analysis and were the one-year exposure before survival events. Fine particulate matter (PM <= 2.5 mu m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5)), the Normalized Dif-ference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the average proportion of open water bodies were used to reflect the air pollu-tion, green and blue space exposures, respectively. PM2.5, green and blue space exposures were time-varying indicators and contemporaneous with heatwaves. Mixed Cox models with time-varying variables were fitted to assess the multiplicative and additive interaction of heatwaves, PM2.5, and green and blue spaces on hypertension, measured by a traditional product term with the ratio of hazard ratio (HR) and relative risk due to interaction (RERI), respec-tively. A positive multiplicative (HRs >1) and additive interaction (RERIs >0) between heatwaves and higher PM2.5 levels was observed. There was a synergistic effect between heatwaves and decreasing greenness levels on hyperten-sion incidence on additive and multiplicative scales. No significant interaction between heatwaves and blue space was observed in the analysis. The combined effects of heatwaves, air pollution, green and blue space exposures on the risk of hypertension varied with age, gender, and educational attainment. This study's findings complemented the existing evidence and revealed synergistic harmful impacts for heatwaves with air pollution and lack of green space on hypertension incidence.

AB  - In the light of global warming, renewables such as solar photovoltaics (PV) are important to decrease greenhouse gas emissions. An important issue regarding implementation of solar panels on large scale, is the limited available area. Therefore, it can be interesting to combine PV with alternative applications, as a ways of not requiring "additional" space. One example is a photovoltaic noise barrier (PVNB), where a noise barrier located along a highway or railway is used as substructure for PV modules. Even though a PVNB is not a novel concept, the absence of economic assessments in literature can be a barrier to their wider implementation. In this paper, a feasibility study of a PVNB in Belgium is conducted, using a cost benefit analysis including a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis. Besides purely economic aspects, also ecological benefits are monetized. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the ecological benefit of noise reduction, which is valuated using a noise sensitivity depreciation index applied to real estate prices, is of major importance in determining the net present value of the case study. On the contrary, the impact of reducing CO2 emissions seems to be negligible when expressed in monetary terms. The results suggest that the PVNB as a whole and also its separate components -.e. the PV array and the noise barrier can be profitable projects, when ecological benefits are included.

AB  - This study focused on the assessment of gas emissions and bioenergy potential of the combustions of bamboo leaves (BL), shoot leaves (BSL) and branches (BB) in the air atmosphere. The main combustion stage of the three residues occurred at between 200 and 600 degrees C, with three peaks of mass loss. The pattern of mass loss rate was BSL > BB > BL, with BSL having the best combustion characteristic parameters. The main evolved gases were CO2 and H2O at between 200 and 600 degrees C. Organic gaseous compounds were decomposed in the range of 200-400 degrees C. Air pollutants were produced in the range of 200-500 degrees C. N-containing gas pollutants were 0.01-0.1 times CO2, while SO2 was produced in a very small amount. BL produced more gas pollutants than did BSL and BB, while the controls over the gas pollutants should be more concentrated in the range of 200-400 degrees C. The joint optimizations of derivative thermogravimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, remaining mass, and conversion degree showed 653.2 degrees C and 5 degrees C/min as the optimum operational conditions for bioenergy utilization, while BB performed as the best feedstock. Among three iso-conversion methods used to estimate activation energy, Flynn-Wall-Ozawa led to best correlation. The Coats-Redfern method pointed to the second order reaction model (f (alpha) = (1-alpha)(2)) as the most likely reaction mechanism. Overall, the bamboo residues were promising as the environmentally friendly and renewable feedstock. Our findings can provide the basis for bioenergy generation, pollution control, and optimal efficiency when the industrial-scale combustions of the bamboo residues are adopted. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Sorghum bicolor (L.) is an important bioenergy source. The stems of sweet sorghum function as carbon sinks and accumulate large amounts of sugars and lignocellulosic biomass and considerable amounts of starch, therefore providing a model of carbon allocation and accumulation for other bioenergy crops. While omics data sets for sugar accumulation have been reported in different genotypes, the common features of primary metabolism in sweet genotypes remain unclear. To obtain a cohesive and comparative picture of carbohydrate metabolism between sorghum genotypes, we compared the phenotypes and transcriptome dynamics of sugar-accumulating internodes among three different sweet genotypes (Della, Rio, and SIL-05) and two non-sweet genotypes (BTx406 and R9188). Results: Field experiments showed that Della and Rio had similar dynamics and internode patterns of sugar concentration, albeit distinct other phenotypes. Interestingly, cellulose synthases for primary cell wall and key genes in starch synthesis and degradation were coordinately upregulated in sweet genotypes. Sweet sorghums maintained active monolignol biosynthesis compared to the non-sweet genotypes. Comparative RNA-seq results support the role of candidate Tonoplast Sugar Transporter gene (TST), but not the Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporter genes (SWEETs) in the different sugar accumulations between sweet and non-sweet genotypes. Conclusions: Comparisons of the expression dynamics of carbon metabolic genes across the RNA-seq data sets identify several candidate genes with contrasting expression patterns between sweet and non-sweet sorghum lines, including genes required for cellulose and monolignol synthesis (CesA, PTAL, and CCR), starch metabolism (AGPase, SS, SBE, and G6P-translocator SbGPT2), and sucrose metabolism and transport (TPP and TST2). The common transcriptome features of primary metabolism identified here suggest the metabolic networks contributing to carbon sink strength in sorghum internodes, prioritize the candidate genes for manipulating carbon allocation with bioenergy purposes, and provide a comparative and cohesive picture of the complexity of carbon sink strength in sorghum stem.

This article is based on the premises that communities can develop resilience by actively building and engaging the capacity to thrive in an environment characterized by change, and that community resilience is an important indicator of social sustainability. Community resilience, as defined herein, is the existence, development, and engagement of community resources by community members to thrive in an environment characterized by change, uncertainty, unpredictability, and surprise. The U. S. Roundtable on Sustainable Forests commissioned a research project to develop a theoretically and empirically based definition of community resilience as well as an associated measurement instrument. In this article, the research is presented, the emergent definition and dimensions of community resilience are posited, and the Community Resilience Self Assessment is introduced.

AB  - Under the background of global climate change, the role of carbon storage in mitigating the increase of atmospheric CO2 concentrations is of paramount importance. However, land use and land cover change (LULC) resulting from urban sprawl disturbs the level and distribution of carbon storage. This study aims to explore the spatiotemporal variability of carbon storage and the correlations between that and urban development for China's 369 cities in 2000, 2010, and 2020. The InVEST model and several multiple linear regression models are employed and the results show that: (1) Cities in western China sequester a large amount of carbon (maximum greater than 2000 TgC) and only some of them, from 2010 to 2020, can maintain a positive change in carbon storage. The rest of China shows a negative change, but a higher carbon storage per area (maximum greater than 0.01 TgC/km2 in the east). Moran's I shows that such variability has a significant spatial autocorrelation. (2) The intensification of the population, the growth of economy, and urbanization are the main factors influencing carbon storage, which are not only reflected on the national scale but also have different local characteristics in different regions. Cities in China's inland regions (e.g., western, some central, and northeastern China), most of which are developing cities, show more diversified impacts of their urban development on carbon storage. However, in developed cities, mostly concentrated in the eastern region, such impacts and variations show a more unified trend. Considering that environmental policy is often a national action, therefore, to strengthen the carbon sequestration capacity of cities, it is necessary to formulate not only a unified leading policy from the national level but also the practical policies of local governments of cities that match their development stages.

AB  - Biomass is the primary source of renewable energy in Poland. Its share in renewable energy production in Poland has decreased in recent years, but it still maintains a nearly 70% share. Poland has extensive forest and straw resources, such as pellets, which can be used for stable biomass production. The main objective of this research was to understand the potential of plant biomass production for energy purposes in Poland and other European Union (EU) countries in terms of sustainable development. The period of analysis covered 2000-2022. Secondary data from Statistical Poland and Eurostat were used. The primary research method was the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, which aimed to check the stationarity of stable biomass. Moreover, we calculated the Vector Auto-Regressive (VAR) model, which was used to develop the forecast. The indigenous production of solid biomass in 2022 decreased to 363,195 TJ, while in 2018, it was 384,914 TJ. Our prognosis confirms that biomass will increase. The prognosis based on the VAR model shows an increase from 365,395 TJ in 2023 to 379,795 (TJ) in 2032. Such countries as France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and Finland have a bigger potential for solid biomass production from forests because of their higher area. As a result, Poland's biomass production competitiveness is varied when compared to other EU nations; it is lower for nations with a large forest share and greater for those with a low forest cover. The two main benefits of producing solid biomass are its easy storage and carbon dioxide (CO2) neutrality. The main advantage is that solid biomass preserves biodiversity, maintains soil fertility, and improves soil quality while lowering greenhouse gas emissions and environmental pollutants. The ability to leave added value locally and generate new jobs, particularly in troubled areas, is the largest social advantage of sustained biomass production.

AB  - Simple Summary In soil, the connection between microbial diversity and plant health is vital in terms of achieving the food security. Here, we suggested the study on soil microbial diversity in diverse cropping systems of banana adopted and followed by small holder farmers over the years. We tracked down the bacterial and fungal diversity in mono cropping and intercropping systems using advanced molecular techniques. Our outcomes likewise uncovered that the impact of cropping systems on bacterial and fungal increments in plant roots and rhizosphere soil. Hence, safeguarding of soil microbial diversity is profoundly significant taking into consideration of the contributions for plant buildups and rhizodeposits into the soil. Improvements in the crop productivity, soil health, and sustainable intensification should be premised on the better understanding of interactions between the cropping systems and soil microbial diversity. In this study, we assessed variations in the microbial communities across the traditional banana-based cropping systems of contrasting monocrop vigor (vigorous or V vs. non-vigorous or NV) and the cropping system (monocrop or MC vs. intercropped or IC) using 16S rDNA (V3-V4) and ITS2 amplicon deep sequencing via Illumina platform. Sequencing results of the bacterial and fungal communities showed high variability among MC and V cropping systems. The abundances of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria were significantly higher in NV (non-vigorous) and V (vigorous) cropping systems; and the abundances of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes in the MC (monocropping) than IC (intercropping). There were high relative abundances of Pseudomonas (6.1-37.43%), Bacillus (4.5-20.4%), Rhizobium (1.4-6.5%), and Devosia (1.5-6.7%) in the cropping systems. The dominant family of fungal class Incertae_sedis was Mortierellales, which accounted for 8.79-41.12% of total taxa. This result indicated that the cropping systems are vital for supporting the dynamic microbial diversity specifically beneficial for bacterial communities that helps in promoting synergistic plant-soil interactions and total productivity under resource poor conditions of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).

AB  - Epoxy composites play a crucial role in modern materials technologies, with their exceptional properties such as high strength and thermal and chemical resistance, making them ideal for a wide range of industrial applications, including aerospace, automotive, construction, and energy. This review article provides a comprehensive overview of the current trends and advancements in epoxy composites, focusing on mechanical properties and their optimization. Attention is given to technological innovations, including the use of nanotechnologies, hybrid reinforcement, and eco-friendly materials, which are key to enhancing the performance and sustainability of these materials. The analysis shows that the introduction of nanomaterials, such as graphene, titanium dioxide, and silicon dioxide, can significantly improve the strength, fatigue resistance, and electrical properties of epoxy composites, opening new possibilities in advanced technologies. Another significant contribution is the development of hybrid composites, which combine different types of fibers, such as carbon, aramid, and glass fibers, enabling the optimization of key properties, including interlayer strength and delamination resistance. The article also highlights the importance of environmental innovations, such as bio-based resins and self-healing mechanisms, which enable more sustainable and long-term effective use of composites. The combination of theoretical knowledge with practical applications provides valuable guidance for designing materials with precisely defined properties for future industrial use. This text thus offers a comprehensive view of the possibilities of epoxy composites in the context of increasing demands for performance, reliability, and environmental sustainability.

AB  - Adequate knowledge of solubility of acid gases in ionic liquids (ILs) at different thermodynamic conditions is of great importance in the context of gas processing and carbon sequestration. Thus, a precise estimation of this key parameter seems inevitable in the design prospective of IL-based separation processes. This paper introduces another interesting application of least square support vector machine (LSSVM) to forecast hydrogen sulfide (H2S) solubility in various ILs. Genetic algorithm (GA) is also employed to obtain optimal magnitudes of hyper parameters (including gamma and sigma(2)) which are embedded in the LSSVM technique. Utilizing 465 data samples (e.g., where 11 ionic liquids are included), the new strategy presented in this study demonstrates great predictive performance so that the coefficient of determination (R-2) and mean squared error (MSE) are determined to 0.997594 and 6.6507E-05, respectively. Provided accurate solubility, such a competent tool has high potential to be combined with existing PVT and chemical engineering software packages for the proper design of process equipment in gas sweetening operations.

AB  - Quality of environmental impact assessments (EIAs) has been criticized, in part due to a lack of accounting in these tools for differing spatial and temporal scales inherent in ecological data. In the United States, leases of outer continental shelf blocks for offshore wind projects and their construction and operation plans require EIAs in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the 1978 Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act. This study evaluated consideration of spatiotemporal scales of stressors, receptors (specifically cetaceans), and effects in eight federal offshore wind energy EIAs against 26 criteria extracted from federal regulations. The criteria analysis determined that EIAs do not consistently or comprehensively address spatiotemporal scales with respect to federal requirements. Deficiencies in addressing spatiotemporal scales may result from imprecise regulations, intent to simplify encyclopedic documents, or lack of data resulting in incomplete assessments, inappropriate mitigation actions, and projects delays. Recommendations to improve compliance with federal regulations include making federal guidance binding, focusing on non-trivial impacts of species, tiering information, and incorporating outcomes of marine spatial planning.

They attempt to solve these problems in order to improve the environmental sustainability of their green building projects by using different construction methods. However, the selection of the construction method for building projects involves a complex decision-making process. To solve this problem of construction method selection, this investigation presents a Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach. The study yields a comprehensive and systematic structure that employs quantitative assessments for priority construction method selection for each green building project and also aids construction companies with regard to their practical application.

The cultural importance of this new machine, however, remains less fully analyzed. This essay explores one facet of that history through a discussion of the commodification of launches in France and Great Britain. These two countries, which have larger middling classes as well as a higher degree of commercialization in general, provided a fertile environment for aeronauts seeking to instruct and entertain an audience willing to fund ballooning. Balloonists had to invent ways to market this scientific discovery and determine how best to attract paying customers. The audience was entertained while simultaneously empowered to act as witnesses to what balloonists presented as a scientific experiment.

AB  - This paper explores the articulation and mobilization of competing notions of energy (in) justice and energy future visions in the struggle over the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project (TMX) in British Columbia, Canada. The TMX is a controversial fossil fuel project because it leads to the appropriation of First Nations lands, gender violence, and the unequal distribution of the socio-environmental costs of tar sands operations. Despite these impacts, the Canadian state argues that the TMX contributes to economic growth, job creation, and increased tax revenues, thereby legitimizing tar sands expansion on Indigenous lands. Drawing upon literature on Indigenous climate/energy justice, we problematize conventional understandings of energy justice and energy futures by examining multiple, interconnected, and often neglected dimensions of justice in the TMX conflict. Through critical discourse analysis, this paper explores how First Nations opposing this pipeline mobilize different notions of justice to envision alternative energy futures. Our study shows how they challenge Canada's fossil fuel future vision by asserting jurisdiction over the lands crossed by the TMX and demanding the cancellation of this pipeline. Centering counter-hegemonic perspectives in discussions about tar sands development provides a starting point for imagining and building more just energy futures.

AB  - In recent decades, heated debate around green technology and its equitable access has aroused the concern of international scholars. This paper provides a review on the exclusion of green technology referred to as 'green techno-apartheid' and examines selected key eco-cities (i.e. Masdar, Songdo IBD and Bangalore) considered in the 2013 United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Report on 'City-Level Decoupling' (2013). Metropolitan planning is a crucial instrument in addressing the challenges of urban social sustainability and is thus considered an important mechanism for developing a platform to approach issues of equitable access to green technology. The study reviews five metropolitan plans: the 'London Plan' (London, England), the 'Municipal Plan 2011 for Greater Copenhagen' (Copenhagen, Denmark), the 'Economically Strong and Sustainable Structural Vision: Amsterdam 2040' (Amsterdam, Netherlands), the 'Hong Kong 2030: Planning Vision and Strategy' (Hong Kong, China) and the 'Metropolitan Plan for Sydney 2036' (Sydney, Australia). The results of the study suggest that while all these plans focus on promoting green technology within a framework of ecological modernisation, they lack appropriate tools for achieving equitable modernisation and enhancing social equity. Consequently, it is essential that researchers and planners take further steps and develop effective instruments to improve equitable access to green technologies and achieve long-term urban social sustainability.

AB  - International demand for wood-based biomass for bioenergy production is growing, and private forestlands in the southeastern United States have the potential to supply that demand. The southeastern United States (Southeast) is the world's largest exporter of wood pellets for bioenergy, primarily to the United Kingdom (UK) and the European Union (EU). However, wood-based biomass production accounts for only a small share of total wood removals from private forestlands in the Southeast. There is sufficient wood-based biomass in the Southeast to support greater production of wood pellets for domestic and international markets without redirecting timber from sawtimber and pulpwood production. In 2018-19, we conducted 39 semi-structured interviews with private forest landowners, foresters, loggers, and biomass production facility managers in Alabama, Florida, and Georgia to obtain their views on wood-based biomass production in the Southeast. Although landowners were interested in supplying wood for biomass as a byproduct of timber harvesting, they seldom participated in wood-based biomass production because of limited and unreliable access to biomass markets. Loggers and production facility managers had not invested in biomass production because they remain skeptical about the financial viability of wood-based biomass. Continued obstacles to biomass production include: price competition with fossil fuels and conventional wood products; inconsistent domestic government support for biomass production; concerns about meeting the sustainability requirements to export wood-based biomass to the UK and EU; and the high costs associated with harvesting low-grade wood for biomass. The barriers to biomass expansion in the southeastern United States remain primarily economic and political rather than biophysical.

AB  - Over the past years, the penetration of photovoltaic (PV) systems into the distribution network has experienced significant augmentation as the pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere keeps increasing while the prices of the solar components keep reducing. Despite the benefits PV systems bring to the distribution network, the high penetration of this technology into the distribution network could lead to reverse power flow (RPF) when the PV systems produce more than the local loads require. This RPF could result in the malfunctioning of protective devices and their coordination. This research addresses this problem by utilizing electric vehicles (EVs) that are currently revolutionizing the transport sector. Here, the charging of EVs during the day is intel-ligently controlled to mitigate RPF as a result of the excess power produced by the PV systems. Resolving RPF is achieved through a control system that measures the power flow on each phase of the main grid substation. If at any instance negative power is detected (reverse power), quantified EVs needing recharge are instantly incor-porated into the network for charging through the automatic closure of the power switches of the required number of charging points with EVs whose total power demand equals the amount of reverse power detected. The excess power is hence absorbed and stored by the EVs. The proposed method is tested on an expanded IEEE 13 node test feeder and simulated using ETAP software. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in eliminating RPF which occurs from 10:00 am to 12:00 noon by connecting the required number of EVs during that timeframe. The proposed method involves the distribution network operators working in synergy with the transport sector to effectively solve the problem of RPF in the distribution network.

AB  - Solar photovoltaics (PV) play a critical role in advancing the sustainable energy transition, but growing concerns about PV waste highlight the need for circular economy solutions within the solar value chain. Meanwhile, concerns for the social impact of the circular economy call for a circular society, emphasizing social and environmental justice and requiring organisational forms that enable economic democracy. In many European countries, citizen energy cooperatives have successfully promoted renewable energy adoption in a democratically controlled and participatory way. However, evidence on the role of cooperatives in a circular economy remains limited. In this paper, we use survey data from Flanders (Belgium), to investigate perspectives of citizen energy cooperative members and non-members on circular solar business models. Our findings reveal that cooperative members exhibit greater interest and trust in solar Product-Service Systems models and PV reuse, driven not only by financial considerations but also by environmental consciousness and cooperative values. This study provides empirical evidence supporting the role of citizen energy cooperatives in fostering the circular economy and recommends cooperatives to ensure participation of disadvantaged communities to contribute to a circular society. The research identifies avenues for future research and contributes to the broader discourse on organising circular societies.

AB  - This article examines how the difficulties in finding sustainable environmental interactions may be rooted in the institutionalized thinking and organizing from which these attempts emerge. A major question addressed is why do agencies and organizations support special interests better than collective ones. There is a long-standing set of political/economic explanations that attribute the structure of agriculture to the political power of established economic interests. The diverse explanations share one conclusion in common: agricultural policy and the structure of agriculture itself in the United States favors the production of commercial food outputs through the use of commercially available inputs instead of promoting the maintenance and enhancement of viable biological, community and food systems. The emphasis on commercial inputs and outputs is compatible with decision-making by individual farmers. Epistemological explanations for why United States agriculture has developed along a path based on individual and commercial inputs and outputs rather than biological and community systems are complementary with political/economic explanations. Current agricultural models and policies are limited in that they are based on mechanical Newtonian assumptions. Discipline boundaries have impeded true implementation of interdisciplinary methodologies and the development of generalized models because the assumptions, cultures, and paradigms within the disciplines have not been overcome. In addition, different organizations have not overcome the differences in the way they transform data into information. This is true of agencies, organizations, and academic disciplines. Can large organizations or agencies handle diversity, given such barriers? For agriculture to play a role in protecting biodiversity, the heterogeneity of agrosystems will have to increase. Recommendations on the structure of organizations to maintain biological diversity in agricultural systems point to resiliency, checks and balances, redundancy, and a substantial research and extension effort to overcome barriers to effectiveness.

AB  - It is an imperative to find a proper way to maintain a balance between the economic development and natural environment's carrying capacity, which is needed for the wellbeing and sustenance of human as well as non-human world. Balancing the economic growth and environmental quality has always been a challenge for business. In recent years, business has brought immeasurable wealth and prosperity. However, it has also caused unintended environmental degradation. Economic development is necessary to face the need of growing population but it should not add to a deteriorating environment. There is a need for broader ethical responses for environmental sustainability. The search for a sustainable future requires an integration of economic development with ethical objectives and scientific knowledge. Sustainability is a concept of continuance, relationships, and orientations. The paper deals with three interrelated ethical concepts, (1) corporate moral status, (2) corporate moral status to include human beings, (3) corporate moral status to include natural environment as a path of environmental sustainability.

AB  - Social responsibility and environmental sustainability issues began to be paid attention in Vietnam due to the impressive economic development in recent years. However, corporate social responsibility (CSR) is still quite a new management concept, especially for small and medium enterprises. Managers are facing multiple obstacles in executing CSR programs in accordance with international standards. Regarding corporate environmental sustainability (CES), the idea of sustainable development is a rising trend in today's business reality. Essentially, CSR is regarded as a part of the overall sustainability issues. For the purpose of studying the impact of CSR and CES on corporate financial performance (CFP), quantitative method has been used to examine the relation between CSR and CFP. Qualitative method has been applied to verify the relation between CSR, CES, and CFP. On the basis of findings, several useful suggestions are made for managers to improve business performance and sustainable development in Vietnam.

AB  - This study examines the effects of corporate sustainability factors (CSFs)-specifically gender diversity, energy practices, and environmental practices-on innovation and their subsequent impact on firm performance in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. By integrating Absorptive Capacity Theory, we explore how these CSFs drive innovation, contributing to broader sustainable development goals. We analyze the impact of innovation on firm performance using the resource-based view (RBV). Utilizing secondary data from the World Bank Enterprise Survey (WBES), we employ a two-stage instrumental variable regression (IV-2SLS) to address endogeneity and establish causal relationships. Our findings reveal that stakeholder engagement through gender diversity, energy practices, and environmental practices significantly enhances innovation, which, in turn, drives firm performance. Diverse leadership fosters creativity and innovation, while energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable practices reduce costs, improve brand reputation, and align with sustainable development goals. These insights underscore essential policy implications for promoting environmental policy, clean production, and sustainable innovation ecosystems. Encouraging MENA firms to engage stakeholders and adopt sustainable practices can drive economic prosperity and contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

AB  - Background: Active school transportation (AST) is an important source of physical activity for children and a potentially important climate change mitigation strategy. However, few studies have examined factors associated with AST in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We used baseline data from a longitudinal survey to investigate correlates of AST during the second wave of COVID-19 (December 2020). We collected survey data from 2291 parents of 7- to 12-year-olds across Canada and linked this information with data on neighborhood walkability and weather from national databases. We assessed potential correlates representing multiple levels of influence of the social-ecological model. We used gender-stratified binary logistic regression models to determine the correlates of children's travel mode to/from school (dichotomized as active vs motorized), while controlling for household income. We examined the correlates of travel mode for both the morning and afternoon trips. Results: Consistent correlates of AST among Canadian children during the COVID-19 pandemic included greater independent mobility, warmer outdoor temperature, having a parent who actively commuted to work or school, living in a household owning fewer vehicles, and living in a more walkable neighborhood. These findings were largely consistent between boys and girls and between morning and afternoon school trips. Conclusions: Policymakers, urban planners, and public health workers aiming to promote AST should focus on these correlates while ensuring that neighborhoods are safe for children. Future research should monitor the prevalence and correlates of AST as COVID-19 restrictions are removed.

AB  - The plastic packaging, and in particular the multilayer flexible packaging, has several characteristics that make it essential in everyday life. However, the sustainability of used materials is undermined by the difficulties encountered for their recycling. The purpose of this study is to assess both the technical feasibility, and above all the environmental sustainability of an effective process enabling the recycling of polyamides-polyethylene multilayers packaging films. The technique used for the separation of the polymers is based on a selective dissolution, carried out using monoethylene glycol. The experimental tests made possible to identify the best conditions for treating the films and for maximizing yields and final products quality. The Life Cycle Assessment of the recycling process modelled at an industrial level, firstly allowed to determine the main process hotspots (i. e. the energy consumption). The LCA analysis was then extended, examining the life cycle of polyamidespolyethylene films with different end-of-life treatments, i.e. incineration, energy recovery and recycling. The results showed that the recycling process, carried out through the selective dissolution of the films, allows to reduce the overall environmental impacts of these materials along their life cycle. Therefore the recycling process analysed here can be considered an effective approach to increase environmental sustainability and recovery of raw materials.

AB  - Background: Hypertension is one of the major causes of disease burden affecting the Finnish population. Over the last decade, evidence-based care has emerged to complement other approaches to antihypertensive care, often without health economic assessment of its costs and effects. This study looks at the extent to which changes proposed by the 2002 Finnish evidence-based Current Care Guidelines concerning the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of hypertension (the ACCG scenario) can be considered cost-effective when compared to modelled prior clinical practice (the PCP scenario). Methods: A decision analytic model compares the ACCG and PCP scenarios using information synthesised from a set of national registers covering prescription drug reimbursements, morbidity, and mortality with data from two national surveys concerning health and functional capacity. Statistical methods are used to estimate model parameters from Finnish data. We model the potential impact of the different treatment strategies under the ACCG and PCP scenarios, such as lifestyle counselling and drug therapy, for subgroups stratified by age, gender, and blood pressure. The model provides estimates of the differences in major health-related outcomes in the form of life-years and costs as calculated from a 'public health care system' perspective. Cost-effectiveness analysis results are presented for subgroups and for the target population as a whole. Results: The impact of the use of the ACCG scenario in subgroups (aged 40-80) without concomitant cardiovascular and related diseases is mainly positive. Generally, costs and life-years decrease in unison in the lowest blood pressure group, while in the highest blood pressure group costs and life-years increase together and in the other groups the ACCG scenario is less expensive and produces more life-years. When the costs and effects for subgroups are combined using standard decision analytic aggregation methods, the ACCG scenario is cost-saving and more effective. Conclusion: The ACCG scenario is likely to reduce costs and increase life-years compared to the PCP scenario in many subgroups. If the estimated trade-offs between the subgroups in terms of outcomes and costs are acceptable to decision-makers, then widespread implementation of the ACCG scenario is expected to reduce overall costs and be accompanied by positive outcomes overall.

AB  - Migration to South Africa is motivated by the pursuit of employment, safety, and improved living conditions. However, immigrants encounter significant challenges, such as restricted access to essential services, which were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Malawian immigrants in South Africa, addressing the lack of attention given to this immigrant population by highlighting their vulnerabilities. Using a qualitative exploratory and descriptive approach, in-depth interviews were conducted with 24 Malawi immigrants who were over 18 years old and had established residency in South Africa before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Five key stakeholders were also interviewed for additional perspectives and to ensure triangulation and improve data reliability. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis strategies and coding with Nvivo12 software. The study highlighted the exacerbated struggles of Malawian immigrants in South Africa amid the COVID-19 pandemic, uncovering systemic discrimination in healthcare, marked by longer wait times and reluctance from health workers to treat undocumented immigrants. The study also revealed a dire security situation, with immigrants living in high-crime areas and feeling particularly targeted due to their foreign status, a situation worsened by the pandemic's economic effects. Additionally, the economic downturn induced by COVID-19 significantly impacted employment opportunities, with many immigrants facing prolonged unemployment and job losses, especially in sectors where they traditionally found work. The detailed accounts of participants highlight not only the multifaceted challenges imposed by the pandemic but also the critical need for inclusive policies and support systems that ensure healthcare access, safety, and economic resilience for immigrants, particularly during global health emergencies. Future research should focus on effective interventions for socioeconomic integration and well-being, particularly for immigrants from other African countries.

AB  - Societies once could choose between changing direction or dealing with climatic disaster; now it is necessary to do both at once. The best-laid plans for mitigation would be hard enough to fulfill in a stable climate, but they will be vastly harder in the climate chaos ahead. If simultaneous mitigation and adaptation are still achievable, such a difficult balance cannot also take on the burden of supporting unrestrained economic growth. The failing efforts so far have been dominated by a search for synergistic ways to mitigate, adapt, and grow economies at the same time, while wishing away the predictable trade-offs between these goals. Wealthy polluting countries have enforced this optimistic spirit in international climate debates, in part to counter the language of loss and damage, which they have seen as a direct challenge. Key to their effort has been a reframing of adaptation that flips the focus from the vulnerability of exposed populations to their resilience. However, the reality of implementing plans for resilience is running into problems, and those populations are instead taking up the banner of climate justice. Debt- and disaster-plagued Puerto Rico illustrates the failure of both adaptation and mitigation through growth and the promise of climate justice as a means to articulate other forms of balance.

AB  - This paper describes a new model, Climate and Regional Economics of Development (CRED), which is designed to analyze the economics of climate and development choices. Its principal innovations are the treatment of global equity, calculation of the optimum interregional flows of resources, and use of McKinsey marginal abatement cost curves to project the cost of mitigation. The unconstrained, optimal climate policy in CRED involves very large capital flows from high-income to developing countries, to an extent that might be considered politically unrealistic. Under more realistic constraints, climate outcomes are generally worse; climate stabilization requires either moderate capital flows to developing countries, or a very low discount rate. In CRED, more equitable scenarios have better climate outcomes; the challenge of climate policy is to persuade high-income countries to accept the need for both international equity and climate protection. The paper ends with an agenda for further model development. A technical appendix describes the model relationships and parameters in greater detail. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Barriers to bioenergy technology implementation have received increased attention in recent years. This paper contributes to the identification and analysis of barriers and drivers behind bioenergy market growth, here labelled "critical factors". It presents a framework for the analysis of both existing and projected bioenergy market potential, using economic concepts and models from transaction cost theory and industrial organization. The framework can be used for assessments of the potential for market growth of different bioenergy systems by decision makers in administration and industry. The following critical factors are identified: Integration with other economic activity, Scale effects on bioenergy markets, Competition in bioenergy markets, Competition with other business, National policy, Local policy and local opinion. The framework is demonstrated with five cases of real bioenergy markets: Pellet residential heating in USA, bioenergy power in USA, pellet residential heating in Sweden, biomass district heating in Sweden, and biomass district heating in Austria. Different applications of the framework are discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - South Africa is a country found on extreme forms of inequality along race, gender, and class lines. Thus, transformation addressing these inequalities of the apartheid past became a critical factor in the re-organisation of society at the onset of democracy in 1994. One essential intervention in addressing mainly the economic disparities of the past was Black Economic Empowerment (BEE), introduced by the African National Congress (ANC) government to overcome the economic legacy of apartheid. The BEE programme, renamed the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) in 2007, measures the transformation performance of companies across all sectors of the economy, according to a specified scorecard. In the absence of a media-specific transformation policy, the Act serves as its transformation policy standard. This paper critiques the B-BBEE policy instrument in relation to print media transformation using Critical race theory, and related concepts, such as racial capitalism, and racial liberalism. The paper finds that despite the racial diversification of the racial composition of the media, B-BBEE is largely an illusion. The B-BBEE strategy has not changed the racial character of the economy, and fundamentally resulted in the co-optation of a small black elite into the wealthy white capitalist elite inherited from the apartheid era, where the "power relationship" reminiscent of apartheid still exists and white privilege intersects with other forms of subordination such as gender and class. Policies supporting media transformation must become "race conscious" in a way that openly confronts racism and engages with systematic racism and exclusion.

AB  - This paper analyzes the investment/environment overlap using a two stage model of two jurisdictions. Capital exports are modeled as choice variables for capital owners who weigh income considerations against the effects of capital exports on the quality of their local environments and on environmental policy. This framework reveals that capital owners have an incentive to cross-haul polluting factors across jurisdictions when direct controls are used to regulate emissions and that this cross-hauling induces policyrnakers to ratchet up environmental policies in both locations. The importance of instrument type and commitment on environmental policy is also analyzed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

AB  - In the past few decades, the world has witnessed a rapid growth in mobile communication and reaped great benefits from it. Even though the fourth generation (4G) mobile communication system is just being deployed worldwide, proliferating mobile demands call for newer wireless communication technologies with even better performance. Consequently, the fifth generation (5G) system is already emerging in the research field. However, simply evolving the current mobile networks can hardly meet such great expectations, because over the years the infrastructures have generally become ossified, closed, and vertically constructed. Aiming to establish a new paradigm for 5G mobile networks, in this article, we propose a cross-layer software-defined 5G network architecture. By jointly considering both the network layer and the physical layer together, we establish the two software-defined programmable components, the control plane and the cloud computing pool, which enable an effective control of the mobile network from the global perspective and benefit technological innovations. Specifically, by the cross-layer design for software-defining, the logically centralized and programmable control plane abstracts the control functions from the network layer down to the physical layer, through which we achieve the fine-grained controlling of mobile network, while the cloud computing pool provides powerful computing capability to implement the baseband data processing of multiple heterogeneous networks. The flexible programmability feature of our architecture makes it convenient to deploy cross-layer technological innovations and benefits the network evolution. We discuss the main challenges of our architecture, including the fine-grained control strategies, network virtualization, and programmability. The architecture significantly benefits the convergence towards heterogeneous networks and enables much more controllable, programmable and evolvable mobile networks. Simulations validate these performance advantages.

AB  - In this study, we conceptualize feminist engagement with neo-liberalism, austerity, and crisis management and analyze potential to advance a feminist "recovery" political agenda. Feminist discursive analysis of crisis and a focus on narrative enables analysis of continuity and change in feminist responses to the pandemic and exposes the nature of opportunities and constraints for mobilization on gender equality. A case study of responses to the pandemic in Ireland and empirical data in areas of care, income support and domestic violence is presented to reflect on gendered analysis of austerity and feminist responses to same, on gendered effects of COVID-19 and feminist responses to pandemic crisis management. The case studies allow us to interrogate feminist's use of crisis to advance social transformation. We discuss whether and how feminist actors in Ireland built on learning from previous crises to generate opportunity to advance feminist demands, to break continuities by reframing old problems and to mobilize in relation to COVID-19. We find some continuity over time, but also greater awareness of connective tissues of multiple crises, making overall strategies of feminist actors and organizations less reactive, more innovative, inclusive and independent than the previous crisis with greater potential for social transformation.

AB  - The benefits or harms of external and internal consequences for the viability of ecosystems are revealed through the impact on the quality of human life. The issues of assessing these benefits or harms are significant for the whole society and are therefore analyzed from both theoretical and practical perspectives. The article seeks to theoretically examine the coherence between humans and ecosystems, ensuring the social and economic well-being of present and future generations in the context of cultural ecosystem services (CES). As well, the article seeks to present the empirical research, carried out on the possibilities of adapting human activities to CES in the specific area, i.e., coastal-rural area, evaluating the past, present and future CES potential in the Lithuanian coastal zone, Nemunas Delta and Curonian Lagoon in Lithuania. Elderships located near the Curonian Lagoon or within the protected area of the Nemunas Delta Regional Park were selected for the study. For this purpose, the empirical study involved representatives of different (public and private) sectors and stakeholders. The research was carried out in local tourism cultural centers and elderships with four group respondents (tourists, farmers, entrepreneurs, eldership employees). The research revealed the past and the current situation of CES potential and showed the possible CES potential future development directions. The article described the opportunities for the rural population (a potential supply of cultural ecosystems) to achieve diversification of economic activities and the needs of tourists (a potential demand for cultural ecosystems) to achieve service differentiation. Therefore, the recommendations have been formulated on how to exploit future CES of a specific territory by "employing" available natural resources, i.e., the ecosystems.

AB  - Changes to cultural norms as a result of electrification can promote gender equity. This paper contributes to the energy transitions literature addressing research complexity from investigating consumption behaviours and opportunities for behaviour change. We ask: how cultural norms influence productive uses of energy technologies and how norms may change as a result of electrification? A scoping and critical review of literature, and empirical study applying grounded theory analysis and the energy cultures framework suggests the value of exploring existing and emerging energy cultures, particularly the nature of material cultures, norms and practices. Qualitative methods used include key informant interviews, transect walks and observation. The application is in the Bugesera District of Rwanda. The main study finding is that there are relationships between minigrids, fuels, values, beliefs and traditions that influence uptake and vice-versa. The emphasis on of productive use is revisited to suggest inclusion of norms such as Agakiriro - making wealth through small scale business enterprises; Ubudehe - mutual assistance welfare practice; new material realities of the modern Rwandan household; local and international technological innovations; old programs - One Laptop Per Child; imihigo - a tradition of goal setting translating to performance contracts, and Made in Rwanda - enhancing the domestic market through value chain development. Inclusion of gender concerns in the push for productive use of electricity and in renewable energy policy can promote sustainable value chain creation and inclusive business model development. Finally, we reflect on policy considerations for stakeholders working in energy development in Rwanda and elsewhere.

AB  - Purpose: Catering services play important role in the Spanish economy, accounting for 6.2% of GDP in 2021. To overcome the adverse economic impacts of COVID-19, catering services are considered one of the drivers to stimulate economic growth. Hence, the main aim of this paper is to analyse the sociodemographic profile of the family's main breadwinner who allocates most of his expenditure budget on different catering services before and during the pandemic caused by the COVID-19 in Spain. Design/methodology/approach: The official Family Budget Survey in Spain was used. This offers information on expenditure by families in 2019 and 2020. CHAID multivariate analysis was employed. This has proved a valuable tool in predicting expenditure, as well as determining the cause-effect relationship of this expenditure. Findings: Findings establish the main breadwinner's expenditure on catering services based on predictors such as "year" affected by the pandemic; "type of employment contract"; "gender"; and "age". A gender "pub-gap" in consumption in bars and cafes has been revealed, and families with a male breadwinner, on a permanent contract, between the age of 40 and 60 spent the most on catering services. Originality/value: This research presents a new interdisciplinary approach to family breadwinners as a company whose spend on catering is shaping the economic recovery and leading to new answers for hospitality management. Identified factors can lead to improved decision-making and contextualisation of economic models for food service providers in a post-pandemic future.

AB  - Natural regeneration of forests is the most cost-effective and most technically straightforward strategy to mitigate climate change. Natural forests account for 71% of China's forested area, but their carbon stocks and sequestration potentials remain unclear. Here, we compiled data from 762 natural forest sites across China and found that natural forests had a carbon stock of 9.40 +/- 1.45 Pg C in 2010. When naturally regenerated to the over-mature stage, existing natural forests can additionally sequestrate 8.67 +/- 6.93 Pg C in the next two centuries, accounting for 48% of the carbon carrying capacity of the natural forest ecosystem in China, i.e. 18.07 +/- 6.78 Pg C. Future carbon sequestration potential in natural forests is dominated by the tree layer at 6.88 +/- 6.87 Pg, followed by the shrub layer at 1.02 +/- 0.55 Pg, floor layer at 0.72 +/- 0.74 Pg and herb layer at 0.05 +/- 0.10 Pg. The natural forests are expected to achieve 70% of their future carbon sequestration potential by 2100. We also note that assisted regeneration via tree planting can play a significant role in natural forest restoration, as the carbon densities of natural and planted forests are rarely significantly different at the same age under 60 years old. Therefore, the preservation and expansion of natural forests is the key strategy for achieving long-term carbon sequestration.

AB  - Cyanobacteria-derived organic carbon has been reported to intensify greenhouse gas emissions from lacustrine sediments. However, the specific processes of CH4 4 and CO2 2 production and release from sediments into the atmosphere remain unclear, especially in eutrophic lakes. To investigate the influence of severe cyanobacteria accumulation on the production and migration of sedimentary CH4 4 and CO2, 2 , this study examined the different trophic level lakes along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The results demonstrated that eutrophication amplified CH4 4 and CO2 2 emissions, notably in Lake Taihu, where fluxes peaked at 929.9 and 7222.5 mu mol/m2 & sdot;h, 2 & sdot;h, mirroring dissolved gas levels in overlying waters. Increased sedimentary organic carbon raised dissolved CH4 4 and CO2 2 concentrations in pore-water, with isotopic tracking showing cyanobacteriaderived carbon specifically elevated CH4 4 and CO2 2 in surface sediment pore-water more than in deeper layers. Cyanobacteria-derived carbon deposition on surface sediment boosted organic carbon and moisture levels, fostering an anaerobic microenvironment conducive to enhanced biogenic CH4 4 and CO2 2 production in surface sediments. In the microcosm systems with the most severe cyanobacteria accumulation, average CH4 4 and CO2 2 concentrations in surface sediments reached 6.9 and 2.3 mol/L, respectively, surpassing the 4.7 and 1.4 mol/L observed in bottom sediments, indicating upward migration of CH4 4 and CO2 2 hotspots from deeper to surface layers. These findings enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying lake sediment carbon emissions induced by eutrophication and provide a more accurate assessment of lake carbon emissions.

AB  - To improve fuel economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, magnesium alloys are being considered for automotive and aerospace applications because of their high strength-to-weight ratio. The structural applications of magnesium components require understanding of low cycle fatigue (LCF) behavior, since cyclic or thermal stresses are frequently encountered in many structural applications. The objective of this study was to examine LCF behavior and the role of twinning on cyclic deformation characteristics in a semi-solid processed (thixomolded) AZ91D magnesium alloy. The semi-solid thixomolded alloy showed a significantly higher fatigue life than its die cast counterpart especially at the lower strain amplitudes. The alloy was cyclically stable at lower strain amplitudes (0.1-0.2%); exhibited cyclic softening followed by cyclic hardening for the remaining life at intermediate strain amplitudes (0.3-0.8%) and cyclic hardening at higher strain amplitudes (1.0-1.2%). As the total strain amplitude increased, the stress amplitude and plastic strain amplitude increased, while the pseudoelastic modulus decreased. Unlike the wrought magnesium alloys reported in the literature, the hysteresis loops of the thixomolded AZ91D alloy were symmetrical in tension and compression. However, a strong non-linear or pseudoelastic stress-strain characteristic remained in both ascending and descending phases especially at higher strain amplitudes due to the occurrence of twinning and detwinning during cyclic deformation. Two types of twins (wider lenticular extension twins and narrower banded contraction twins) were observed in some favorably oriented larger primary alpha-Mg grains near the fracture surface. Fatigue life increased with decreasing strain ratio, and partial mean stress relaxation occurred mainly in the initial 10-20% of fatigue life. Fatigue crack initiation was observed to occur from the specimen surface or near-surface defects, and crack propagation was characterized by striation-like features. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Excessive emissions of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) pollutants are leading to increased eutrophication of water bodies. Biological N and P removal processes have become a research priority in the field of sewage treatment with the aim of improving sewage discharge standards in countries worldwide. Denitrifying P removal processes are more efficient for solving problems related to carbon source competition, sludge age conflict, and high aeration energy consumption compared to traditional biological N and P removal processes, but they are easy to produce nitrous oxide (N2O) in the process of sewage treatment. N2O is a greenhouse gas with a global warming potential approximately 190-270 times that of CO2 and 4-21 times that of CH4, which was produced and released into the environmental in denitrifying P removal systems under conditions of a low C/N ratio, high dissolved oxygen, and low activity of denitrifying phosphorus accumulating organisms (DPAOs). This paper reviews the emission characteristics and influencing factors of N2O during denitrifying P removal processes and proposes appropriate strategies for controlling the emission of N2O. This work serves as a basis for the development of new sewage treatment processes and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in future wastewater treatment plants.

AB  - In this paper Kenya's climate change mitigation ambitions are analysed from an energy system perspective, with a focus on the role of renewable and other low-carbon energy technologies. At COP-21 in 2015 in Paris, Kenya has committed to a 'nationally determined contribution' of reducing domestic greenhouse gas emissions by 30% in 2030 in comparison to a business-as-usual projection. An efficient exploitation of the country's renewable energy resources is key to achieving this target. We use the TIAM-ECN model to characterize plausible development pathways for the Kenyan energy mix until 2050 under different climate change mitigation scenarios. We conclude that the power sector can expand with mostly renewable energy options even in the absence of stringent greenhouse gas abatement targets. On the contrary, on the demand side a substantial deployment of low-carbon technologies is triggered only when ambitious emission reduction objectives are in place. The introduction of these technologies entails additional energy system costs, ranging in 2050 from 0.5% to 2% of the country's GDP. Our analysis supports the feasibility of Kenyan climate management goals, provided that adequate investments in renewable and other low-carbon energy technologies are timely made available.

AB  - Global population growth and urbanization necessitate countless more buildings in this century, causing an unprecedented increase in energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, waste generation and resource use. It is imperative to achieve maximal efficiency in buildings quickly. The building envelope is a key element to address environmental concerns, as it is responsible for thermal transfers to the outdoors, causing energy demand and carbon emissions. It also requires cladding, thus consuming a significant amount of finite resources. This paper investigates the relationship between surface area and indoor space to unravel the sustainability of building forms. Firstly, we demonstrate what the optimal form is. Secondly, as a single definite form is of little use in practice, we develop a scale-independent metric to measure the degree of optimality of building forms and show its practical use. This newly developed metric can significantly help in early design stages, by quantifying how much a building form deviates from optimality and identifying the domain of alternative geometries to bring us closer to it. This compactness measure also represents a theoretical basis for further research, to explore how optimality changes when additional parameters are factored in. It therefore contributes to both theory and practice to support global efforts towards sustainable built environments.

AB  - COVID 19 pandemic is the worst crisis that mankind has seen since World War-II. It has exposed glaring loopholes in the healthcare system and led to a global health crisis. In absence of any specific treatment or vaccine, countries began to enforce strict lockdown measures leading to a complete shutdown of economic activities. The purpose of this study is to identify key exit strategies that can be implemented to mitigate the impacts of COVID 19. Identification and categorisation of parameters have been achieved using multi criterion decision making techniques of Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) and Cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification MICMAC analysis. The study highlights a classification of key strategies based on their driving power and dependence which may enable Government to strengthen the disease surveillance system and effectively reduce the impact of the disease. The findings of the study suggest that Environmental Sustainability and Human Well-being; Online Awareness and Capacity Building Programme; Graded Surveillance-Targeted Restrictions and Stricter norms for Inter-State Mobility; and Harmonization between Centre, State and Local Authorities are the most important strategies that needs to be factored in while planning for the post lockdown economic recovery. With countries eager to resume economic activities, the strategies identified in our study can assist the governments and policymakers across the world in devising their exit plans while giving due consideration to each of the strategies to counter the disruptions brought about by the COVID 19 pandemic.

AB  - Sustainable agriculture has a pending goal in the revalorization of agrofood residues. Wine lees are an abundant residue in the oenological industry. This residue, so far, has been used to obtain tartaric acid or pigments but not for being qualitatively characterized as a source of polar and mid-polar compounds such as flavonoids, phenols and essential amino acids. Lees extracts from 11 Spanish wineries have been analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in high resolution mode. The high-resolution power of LC-MS/MS has led to the tentative identification of the most representative compounds present in wine lees, comprising primary amino acids, anthocyans, flavanols, flavonols, flavones and non-flavonoid phenolic compounds, among others. Attending to the profile and content of polar and mid-polar compounds in wine lees, this study underlines the potential of wine lees as an exploitable source to isolate interesting compounds.

AB  - The impact of the transport sector on global greenhouse gas emissions has triggered the development of regulations to limit carbon dioxide emissions. The measurement process for vehicle emissions is based on laboratory type-approval tests, which results in gap compared with on-road usage profiles. Although recently introduced vehicle technologies have increased energy efficiency, regulatory restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions necessitate additional solutions. The use of biofuels, such as ethanol, fosters carbon dioxide emissions mitigation in developing countries, such as Brazil. Flex-fuel vehicles are an important alternative technology for the transition to zero-emission vehicles. In addition to vehicle emissions, the fuel production chain also has emissions which depend on the efficiency of the process and feedstock origin. Consequently, this study focuses on flex-fuel vehicles by quantifying the gap between certification and real-world driving energy consumption and by calculating the well-to-wheel impacts accounting for user behaviour choices when refuelling the vehicles. The results show 15.1 and 24.2 % higher fuel consumption in real driving conditions compared to laboratory tests using gasoline and ethanol, respectively. The analysis of the impacts on a well-to-wheel basis confirms the effectiveness of ethanol in mitigating the impacts at the energy production stage. Based on the fuels used in this study, first-generation ethanol leads to a 58 % reduction in carbon dioxide emissions compared with gasoline. Considering second-generation ethanol, the difference increases to up to 73 % lower emissions than gasoline. These results contribute to increasing consumer awareness, which plays an important role in mitigating environmental impacts.

AB  - For a long time, fossil fuel has been a part of our everyday lives and has constantly led to the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the environment. The release of methane (CH4) into our surroundings can be caused by the decomposition of organic wastes produced by our daily activities; CH4 produced by human activity is responsible for at least 25 % of global warming. CH4 is a known potent greenhouse gas that can trap about 35 times more heat than CO2. These greenhouse gases play a role in climate change and global warming. It, therefore, becomes important to explore measures for decarbonizing our environment. Biomethane production using our generated waste is a promising decarbonization approach with significant potential for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. This paper overviews potential biomass methanation feedstocks and investigates several technologies, such as anaerobic digestion, combined pyrolysis and methanation, and combined gasification and methanation. SWOT analysis of waste conversion to biomethane was conducted, and important points related to the scaling-up of biomethane production processes were outlined. Also, insights into prospects for promoting biomass methanation deployment were provided. In conclusion, biomass methanation has great potential for producing sustainable energy. Hence, collaboration between industrialists, researchers, government agencies, and stakeholders including an understanding of the financial investments, return on investments, or potential subsidies and incentives could enhance the practicality of the proposed solution. Research and development should be continuously carried out as they are necessary to scale up and promote the technology. Also, there should be technical training for stakeholders as it is essential for the smooth development of the sector.

AB  - Prior studies mentioned that extracts of polyphenolics-abundant edible flora might provide compositions of reversible electron shuttles for bioenergy extraction; however, detailed mysteries behind such phenomena still remained open to be explored. This first-attempt study selected a medicinal herb Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi and its main flavonoid ingredients to quantitatively decipher their electron-mediating activities for bioenergy applications. The main ingredients with strong shuttling activities (e.g., baicalin, baicalein and wogonin) were chemical structure-associated to disclose electrochemical and bioenergetics characteristics for comparative analysis. Evidently, baicalin owned the most promising electron shuttling capabilities. Although extract of flavonoids-rich S. baicalensis Georgi also showed promising redox-mediating characteristics, typical ingredient-baicalein still exhibited high biotoxicity to bacterial CO2 respirometric production, thereby resisting fully expression of electron transfer capabilities. Supplementation of baicalin and extract of S. baicalensis Georgi to microbial fuel cells (MFCs) was conducted to quantify such stimulating capabilities of bioelectricity generation. That is, with toxicity attenuation, processed flavonoids-rich medicinal herbs were possibly electroactive for bioenergy extraction due to favorable electron-shuttling activities.

AB  - To achieve the dual goals of minimising global pollution and meeting diverse demands for environmental justice, energy transitions need to involve not only a shift to renewable energy sources but also the safe decommissioning of older energy infrastructures and management of their toxic legacies. While the global scale of the decommissioning challenge is yet to be accurately quantified, the climate impacts are significant: each year, more than an estimated 29 million abandoned oil and gas wells around the world emit 2.5 million tons of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. In the US alone, at least 14 million people live within a mile of an abandoned oil or gas well, creating pollution that is concentrated among low-income areas and communities of colour. The costs involved in decommissioning projects are significant, raising urgent questions about responsibility and whether companies who have profited from the sale of extracted resources will be held liable for clean-up, remediation and management costs. Recognising these political goals and policy challenges, this article invites further research, scrutiny and debate on what would constitute the successful and safe decommissioning of sites affected by fossil fuel operations - with a particular focus on accountability, environmental inequality, the temporality of energy transitions, and strategies for phasing out or phasing down fossil fuel extraction.

AB  - While deforestation rates decline globally they are rising in the Western Amazon. Artisanal-scale gold mining (ASGM) is a large cause of this deforestation and brings with it extensive environmental, social, governance, and public health impacts, including large carbon emissions and mercury pollution. Underlying ASGM is a broad network of factors that influence its growth, distribution, and practices such as poverty, flows of legal and illegal capital, conflicting governance, and global economic trends. Despite its central role in land use and land cover change in the Western Amazon and the severity of its social and environmental impacts, it is relatively poorly studied. While ASGM in Southeastern Peru has been quantified previously, doing so is difficult due to the heterogeneous nature of the resulting landscape. Using a novel approach to classify mining that relies on a fusion of CLASlite and the Global Forest Change dataset, two Landsat-based deforestation detection tools, we sought to quantify ASGM-caused deforestation in the period 1984-2017 in the southern Peruvian Amazon and examine trends in the geography, methods, and impacts of ASGM across that time. We identify nearly 100,000 ha of deforestation due to ASGM in the 34-year study period, an increase of 21% compared to previous estimates. Further, we find that 10% of that deforestation occurred in 2017, the highest annual amount of deforestation in the study period, with 53% occurring since 2011. Finally, we demonstrate that not all mining is created equal by examining key patterns and changes in ASGM activity and techniques through time and space. We discuss their connections with, and impacts on, socio-economic factors, such as land tenure, infrastructure, international markets, governance efforts, and social and environmental impacts.

AB  - Purpose Transformative value is a central tenet of transformative service research (TSR) because it affects individual and community well-being, quality of life and sustainability. Although transformative value plays a significant role in well-being, the literature suffers from a lack of sound interdisciplinary conceptual frameworks that delineate how transformative value is created in services throughout the service consumption process. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine the nature and role of service communications during the various stages of the service consumption process to enable the creation of transformative value for people and the environment. Design/methodology/approach To achieve the above goal, the authors integrate agenda-setting theory (media theory) combined with framing and relational dialectics (communication theories) as well as TSR. Findings In line with the objectives of the study, the authors propose an integrative framework named Transformative Value Creation via Service Communications (TVCSC) that explains how firms set their transformative corporate agendas through their dialectics with consumers, society and media. This transformative agenda is reflected in the marketing mix of their services (7Ps) as communicated with various means, physically and digitally (sales/frontline personnel, advertising, CSR, social media and website). Recommendations for a transformative marketing mix are provided. Furthermore, TVCSC illustrates how value is co-created in all customer-firm interactions via relationship dialectics throughout the service consumption process to result in transformative value outcomes. Research limitations/implications The proposed framework identifies several research gaps and provides useful future research directions. Originality/value This is the first comprehensive framework that explains how transformative value is created through the various communications in services and is the outcome of value co-creation interactions of the service consumption process.

AB  - This article examines the instrumentalization of women's rights and the transformation of the gender rights regime in the context of democratic backsliding in Turkey. I show how the Islamically rooted Justice and Development Party governments and their allies used women's rights in constructing authoritarian rule and promoting a conservative gender agenda. The governing elites had different needs at different political stages and instrumentalized women's rights to meet those needs. First, they needed to legitimize their rule in a secular context, so they expanded liberal laws on women's rights. Second, in the process of backsliding, they sought to construct and legitimize their conservative ideology, so they reinterpreted existing laws to promote conservative goals. Finally, they wanted to mobilize conservative women in support of the newly authoritarian regime, so they built new institutions and marginalized existing women's NGOs. The article contributes to the literature on regime types and gender rights by shifting the focus from regime type to regime change.

AB  - Many steel refineries generate significant quantities of coke oven gas (COG), which is in some cases used only to generate low pressure steam and small amounts of electric power. In order to improve energy efficiency and reduce net greenhouse gas emissions, a combined cycle power plant (CCPP) where COG is used as fuel is proposed. However, desulfurization is necessary before the COG can be used as a fuel input for a CCPP. Using a local steel refinery as a case study, a proposed desulfurization process is designed to limit the H2S content in COG to less than 1 ppmv, and simulated using ProMax. In addition, the proposed CCPP plant is simulated in Aspen Plus and is optimized using GAMS to global optimality with net present value as the objective function. Furthermore, the carbon tax is considered in this study. The optimized CCPP plant was observed to generate more than twice the electrical efficiency when compared to the status quo for the existing steel refinery. Thus, by generating more electricity within the plant gate, the need to purchase electricity reduces, and hence reducing the lifecycle of CO2 emissions considerably.

AB  - The occurrence of the mycotoxins deoxynivalenol (DON) and ochratoxin A (OTA) in the winter wheat of 1997 and 1998 grown under organic farming conditions was investigated using ELISAs (R-Biopharm(R)) for quantification. The influence of delayed drying of the grain after harvest on the development of DON and OTA was determined in storage trials (moisture: 17% and 20%; temperature: 20 degreesC; duration: four and six weeks). The Tox5 PCR assay was used both to detect Fusarium species with the potential to produce trichothecenes and as a measure of their relative DNA content during the storage trials. The intensity of the PCR signals was correlated with the DON concentration. Fusarium species were identified microscopically by standard methods. All the freshly harvested grain samples were contaminated with DON and showed further increases in the DON concentration during storage. OTA contamination was found in 14.3% of the 1997 samples and in 24.1% of the 1998 samples. OTA increased during storage trials of the 1997 samples but not in the 1998 samples.

AB  - The demand for humanitarian and development aid has risen to an unprecedented level in recent years. With a pressing need for new solutions, designers have started using digital fabrication (3D printing, CNC milling and laser cutting) to produce life-saving items. However, many organisations are failing to create the impacts they desire, and the social aspect of sustainability has been largely overlooked. This paper addresses this gap in knowledge by investigating guidelines for Design for Social Sustainability, specifically looking at digital fabrication for humanitarian and development projects. Building on existing literature and conducting three in-depth case studies of healthcare related products, the research develops a framework for Design for Social Sustainability. It provides useful guidelines to help plan and evaluate digital fabrication projects in the humanitarian and development sector. The findings show how design can trigger social sustainability at product, process and paradigm levels. Specifically, the case studies reveal the potential for digital fabrication to lead to more systems-focused, radical social sustainability. The paper concludes that an iterative and holistic approach to Design for Sustainability is needed, that begins by examining the social dimension first.

AB  - The biomass exploitation takes advantage of the agricultural, forest, and manure residues and in-extent, urban and industrial wastes, which under controlled burning conditions, can generate heat and electricity, with limited environmental impacts. Biomass can - significantly - contribute in the energy supplying system, if the engineers will adopt the necessary design changes to the traditional systems and become more familiar with the design details of the biomass heating systems. The aim of this paper is to present a methodology of the design of biomass district heating systems taking into consideration the optimum design of building structure and urban settlement around the plant. The essential energy parameters are presented for the size calculations of a biomass burning-district heating system, as well as for the environmental (i.e. Greenhouse Gas Emissions) and economic evaluation (i.e. selectivity and viability of the relevant investment). Emphasis has been placed upon the technical parameters of the biomass system, the economic details of the boiler, the heating distribution network, the heat exchanger and the Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

AB  - In situ observing networks are increasingly being used to study greenhouse gas emissions in urban environments. While the need for sufficiently dense observations has often been discussed, density requirements depend on the question posed and interact with other choices made in the analysis. Focusing on the interaction of network density with varied meteorological information used to drive atmospheric transport, we perform geostatistical inversions of methane flux in the South Coast Air Basin, California, in 2015-2016 using transport driven by a locally tuned Weather Research and Forecasting configuration as well as by operationally available meteorological products. We find total-basin flux estimates vary by as much as a factor of two between inversions, but the spread can be greatly reduced by calibrating the estimates to account for modeled sensitivity. Using observations from the full Los Angeles Megacities Carbon Project observing network, inversions driven by low-resolution generic wind fields are robustly sensitive (p<0.05) to seasonal differences in methane flux and to the increase in emissions caused by the 2015 Aliso Canyon natural gas leak. When the number of observing sites is reduced, the basin-wide sensitivity degrades, but flux events can be detected by testing for changes in flux variance, and even a single site can robustly detect basin-wide seasonal flux variations. Overall, an urban monitoring system using an operational methane observing network and off-the-shelf meteorology could detect many seasonal or event-driven changes in near real timeand, if calibrated to a model chosen as a transfer standard, could also quantify absolute emissions.

AB  - This paper aims to examine two closely related issues based on social awareness of greenhouse gas emissions. The first aim is to find whether firms choose to include carbon accounting in their financial and accounting statements. The second aim is to find what the explanatory factors are behind the decisions managers take to reflect them. A sample of 119 firms from different developed and developing countries and industries for 2011 was employed. We then formulated a dependence model in which the dependent variable was whether or not the company included carbon accounting in its annual reports. By using two logit regression models, our findings show that not all the firms analysed publish such information in their annual accounts and that only the variables related to emission trading schemes and no Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) indicators on climate change positively affect the firm's decision to reflect carbon accounting.

AB  - The aim of this research is to explore the determinants of sustainable consumption with respect to Goal-Framing theory. The study has adopted high and low involvement product categories to identify which motivational factor is more relevant in each of the categories. This is a validation and extension to the Goal-framing theory conducted in the context of developing nation settings. There are three motivational factors, gain, hedonic and normative motivations taken as a predictor to consumer intentions to adopt sustainable products. The integrated effects of the motivational factors were also determined to have a comprehensive study on them with respect to sustainable consumption. The study follows a quantitative research method technique and gathered the data using an adapted questionnaire For both the samples, different sample sizes were acquired as per their nature, PLS-SEM technique was used to test the measurement and structural models. For both the samples, different results are obtained and suggestions are given accordingly. The study provides insights to the policymakers and practitioners. Further areas of research in the area are also suggested.

This paper combines the existing knowledge on antecedents of sustainable consumption (SC) to enhance the understanding and highlights the significance of new research. It also identifies new research ideas in the area of sustainable/green consumption. The review reveals the sparse work done in examining the impact of certain socio-psychographic antecedents and the sustainable consumption process as a whole. This review, though a selective rather than exhaustive, identifies 28 independent variables as antecedents of SC and it suggests to look at the linear and nonlinear effects of individual level factors as well as institutional level factors.

AB  - This paper argues that pollution-intensive sectors may be subject to opposing forces of comparative advantage since these sectors are also typically capital intensive, yet regions with low environmental regulations tend to be those that are the least capital abundant. We examine therefore, whether compositional changes in pollution arising from trade liberalization originate due to differences in capital-labor endowments and/or differences in environmental regulations. The contribution of the paper is threefold; first, we provide a comprehensive empirical analysis of the determinants of four common pollutants, paying particular attention to the nature of the trade-induced composition effect; second, we investigate whether the result of Antweiler et al. (Amer. Econom. Rev. 91 (2001) 877), who find evidence that both environmental regulations and capital-labor endowments determine sulfur dioxide concentrations, also holds for sulfur dioxide emissions; third, we examine whether this result holds for altogether different pollutants. Our results, while providing partial support for Antweiler et al., also raise a number of points for discussion. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A need for an integrative framework that adopts a tiered approach is warranted. Four guiding principles proposed as key components of a sound framework include capabilities, social inclusion, meaningfulness to those in poverty, and sustainability. Twelve domains are defined and compatible with the guiding principles. Finally, a process for developing a comprehensive, principle based indicator framework of poverty solutions is outlined.

AB  - Economics, demographics, land use change, and transport interact in complex and dynamic ways. To inform urban policy decision-making it is important to develop tools that incorporate the interactions of these systems in meaningful ways. Historically, models of these systems have been developed in isolation, and many agencies have already invested large amounts of time and money into developing these independent models. It is thus often desirable to couple existing models, rather than to develop a completely new integrated model. Coupling together independently developed models introduces many challenges including dealing with different spatial and temporal scales, base datasets and levels of aggregation, as well as bringing up deeper questions around the underlying paradigms, assumptions and limitations of the models. This paper describes the key challenges encountered when coupling an existing integrated model of land use change, economic activity, and population (the 'Integrated Scenario Explorer' model) with an existing transport model (the 'Wellington Transport Strategy Model') for the Wellington region in New Zealand. The case study results show that the coupling produces substantial differences in the urban land use change looking forward to 2041, specifically it affects the location of the urban intensification. The paper summarises the important considerations for modellers when coupling independently developed models, highlights the importance of understanding the underlying theories of the component models, and emphasises the need to develop pragmatic solutions that are guided by the intended use of the resulting integrated model.

AB  - This study examines an overlooked dynamic in sociological research on greenhouse gas emissions: how local areas appropriate the global carbon cycle for use and exchange purposes as they develop. Drawing on theories of place and space, we hypothesize that development differentially drives and spatially decouples use- and exchange-oriented emissions at the local level. To test our hypotheses, we integrate longitudinal, county-level data on residential and industrial emissions from the Vulcan Project with demographic, economic and environmental data from the U.S. Census Bureau and National Land Change Database. Results from spatial regression models with two-way fixed-effects indicate that alongside innovations and efficiencies capable of reducing environmentally harmful effects of development comes a spatial disarticulation between carbon-intensive production and consumption within as well as across societies. Implications for existing theory, methods and policy are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to address the growing demands for clean energy, coupled with the efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, this study concerns a newly developed hybrid renewable energy system, which integrates solar and wind energy options, augmented with compressed air energy storage and battery storage solutions. The novelty of this paper stems around the diversification of energy storage solutions, which allows for meeting a highly variable demands in a more efficient and carbon-free manner. The present system is designed to provide a sustainable solution for the communities and is, in this regard, applied to supply the essential energy needs for a small city of about 5000 homes. The electricity is generated through a wind farm as well as power production from the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) and stored depending on the demands. The district heating and cooling loads are supplied from parabolic trough dishes, concentrated on a solar tower and processed through heating and refrigeration subsystems. Following the system development, the comprehensive thermodynamic analysis, optimization study and life cycle assessments are comparatively conducted. The proposed energy system ach-ieves the energy and exergy efficiencies of 50.3 % and 44.1 % respectively. The ORC subsystem accounts for the highest exergy destruction in the system. The solar farm achieves an energy efficiency of 85 % and an exergy efficiency of 65 %, respectively. The ORC subsystem accounts for 59.7 % of the environmental impact throughout all impact categories due to the system irreversibilities and heat losses.

AB  - Connected vehicle (CV) technology has show in great potential in enhancing safety, mobility, and environmental sustainability of road way transportation system s by enabling vehicles and in frastructure to exchange real-time information through wireless communications. The information available through CV technology has heen used to develop a variety of onboard driver assistance tools and applications. This paper presents an innovative, safety-focused CV application called the high-speed differential warning (HSDW). The application identifies potential hazards resulting from high-speed differentials between HSDW-equipped vehicles (ego-vehicles) and surrounding remote vehicles and then provides alerts to drivers of ego-vehicles to help them take appropriate actions. In this research, real-world scenarios and parameters of the HSDW application are first identified. A driver response strategy for each scenario is then developed in consonance with findings from a public survey on the HSDW application. Next, a comprehensive evaluation of various scenarios is conducted with a well-calibrated Paramics traffic microscopic simulation tool set up for a real-world traffic network. Finally, the safety performance of HSDW-equipped vehicles, unequipped vehicles, and overall traffic is analyzed with the surrogate safety assessment model. Results demonstrate that the proposed HSDW application improves the safety performance of ego-vehicles without com promising the mobility and environmental sustainability performance of the overall traffic.

AB  - There are a number of established, scientifically supported metrics of sustainability. Many of the metrics are data-intensive and require extensive effort to collect data and compute the metrics. Moreover, individual metrics do not capture all aspects of a system that are relevant to sustainability. A pilot project was initiated to create an approach to measure, monitor, and maintain prosperity and environmental quality of a regional system. The goal was to produce a straightforward, inexpensive methodology that is simple to use and interpret. This requires historical data be readily accessible, metrics must be applicable to the relevant scale, and results must meet the needs of decision-makers. Because sustainability is a multidimensional concept, the research group consisted of a multidisciplinary team that identified the major components of an environmental system. We selected metrics to capture the multidimensionality of sustainability in environmental systems and included: (1) emergy to capture the quality-normalized flow of energy through the system; (2) ecological footprint to capture the impact of humans on the system; (3) green net regional product to estimate human prosperity and well being within the system; and (4) Fisher information to capture the dynamic order of the system. We were able to compute metrics for a test geographic region using existing datasets. Preliminary analysis indicates that each metric reveals a somewhat different trend. These preliminary findings support the idea that characterization of sustainability requires a multidisciplinary approach and demonstrate the need to measure multiple aspects of an environmental system.

AB  - As the global population exceeds 8 billion and is projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, the demand for sustainable food production has become increasingly pressing. This study investigates the integration of aquaponics into solar-assisted plant factories as an innovative solution to enhance agricultural productivity and minimize environmental impacts. The aquaponics establishes a closed-loop nutrient cycle, utilizing fish waste to nourish plants and optimize water recycling. Employing a two-tiered design, optimized through the Design of Experiments (DOE), the system enables effective resource management and operational efficiency. Operational data reveal the system's ability to maintain favorable temperature and humidity conditions, promoting uniform plant growth. The analysis identifies the mist irrigation method and LED lighting as critical factors that positively influence both root and leaf growth, establishing an optimal combination for sustainable cultivation. These findings underscore the potential of renewable energy-powered plant factories as a viable model for sustainable food production, contributing to local food self-sufficiency and regional economic revitalization. This research highlights the importance of advancing innovative agricultural practices to address the dual challenges of population growth and climate change, advocating for the development and implementation of sustainable technologies to secure future food production.

AB  - While the potential benefits of integrating digital technologies and supply chain management have been widely reported, less is known concerning the current state-of-the-art literature on big data-driven sustainable supply chains. Therefore, this study aims to systematise published studies which address the implications of big data for sustainable supply chain management. Through a systematic literature review, this work makes three significant contributions: (a) it provides an overview of extant literature on this topic in recent years; (b) it proposes seven gaps in the literature in order to foster future investigations on big data-driven sustainable supply chains; (c) it offers four lessons for business practitioners aiming to use big data for sustainable supply chain practices. These lessons suggest that: developing big data analytics capability has to become a business priority in order to effectively build competitive sustainable supply chains; big data has benefits for each of the dimensions of the triple-bottom-line in supply chains; the implementation of big data for sustainability in supply chains presents some challenges for firms; the development of complementary organizational capabilities is needed to overcome challenges and facilitate the benefits of big data technology for sustainable supply chain management.

AB  - The negative impact of business activities on resources and sustainability include pollution and environmental externalities, which are becoming more severe and attracting worldwide attention. This study investigates a mechanism for motivating supply chain members to collaboratively produce environmentally friendly products (EFPs), with an investment in pollution reduction and prevention and by considering environmental regulations and incentive policies From the perspective of supply chain members, we focus on studying optimal pricing strategies for environmentally sustainable supply chains and the relationship between firm performance and environmental policy incentives. By treating the EFP as an investment project, its economic feasibility can be evaluated in the context of the supply chain. Unlike traditional supply chain models, in our model, government policy incentives are shared within the supply chain through transfer price negotiations between manufacturers and suppliers. This study addresses the impact of government policy incentives on value transition and profit allotment in the collaborative supply chain system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Environmental policy instruments allow incorporating the problem of using the natural resources into the decision-making process of individual agents. One of the most efficient instruments for environmental protection are economic instruments, the indirect methods of influencing agents' behaviour. The aim of the article is to present the state of the Polish system of economic instruments in the light of other European countries' experiences (especially the European Union countries) and prospects for the use of economic instruments in the environmental policy during the oncoming years. The study is based on a subject literature review, reports ordered by the Polish Ministry of Environment and publications published by The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the European Environment Agency (EEA). The analysis suggests that economic instruments are widely used in the Polish environmental policy. The main economic instruments in this policy are environmental charges and fines. Some of these charges and fines have been used in the Polish environmental policy for several dozen years. Revenues from these instruments are earmarked for environmental expenditures. There are also some new, interesting economic instruments applied in the Polish environmental policy, such as: depositrefund systems, tradable energy certificates and emissions trading scheme. There are some opportunities for expanding the use of economic instruments for the environmental policy in Poland. For example, there could be increased the use of some environmental charges or taxes, and the environmental insurance. Poland could also implement an environmental tax reform.

This paper argues that more realistic discontinuous schedules are suggested by the development economics literature and these have interesting and counter-intuitive policy implications. The cases examined suggest more stringent environmental regulations and the use of continuous fine functions.

AB  - Since Confederation in 1867, official Canadian settler government policy on the environment has sought to simultaneously preserve "wilderness" and exploit natural resources for market gain. In the 1960s, the nascent North American modern environmental movement pushed for stronger regulation on pollution and toxics - and a more institutionalised state-led response to environmental problems emerged. Throughout the last five decades, three principal "eras" of federal government reaction have emerged in response to mounting scientific evidence and public pressure to act on environmental issues. The first, from the late-1960s to mid-1980s, saw the development and implementation of early environmental policy and programmes. The second era, from the mid-1980s to mid-2000s co-occurred alongside the rise of the sustainable development paradigm, and is marked by the Canadian government's attempt at leadership on the global stage. The third era, from the mid-2000s to 2015, demonstrates a shift from environmental regime-building and multilateral collaboration toward rollbacks and obstructionism. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, the government of Canada reversed decades of progress and cooperation on the environment and sustainable development through its muzzling of government scientists, superficial co-optation of climate policy, rollbacks of environmental legislation and disparagement of environmental activists. In total, by shifting the federal government from a position of ineffective benevolence on environmental issues to one of contention and antagonism, the Harper government's approach represents a departure from Canadian environmental governance norms and sought to remake the identity of Canada as an energy superpower inextricably tied to its oil and gas industry.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystem is a significant natural source of CH4 emission in the atmosphere. To fully understand the dynamics of methane emissions in reservoirs, it is essential to grasp the temporal and vertical distribution patterns, as well as the factors that influence the methanogenic bacterial communities within the sediments. This study investigates the methane dynamics, carbon isotope fractionation (delta(CH4)-C-13), and abundance of functional microorganisms along the geochemical gradient in the in situ sedimentary column of Hongfeng Reservoir (China). Notably, the methane concentration in sediment in summer ranged in 15.39-127.22 mu mol/L, which is twice as high as wintertime concentrations in the surface layer near the sediment-water interface (0-10 cm depth). Illumina sequencing of the sediments identified 11 genera affiliated with methanogenic archaea, with dominant genus Methanosaeta reaching a relative abundance of 34.95% in summer. The total carbon (TOC) content in sedimentary columns in different seasons is positively correlated with Methanosarcina (P < 0.05). In addition, seasonal discrepancies are observed in the sediment profiles for total nitrogen (TN), sulfate (SO42-), and ferrous iron (Fe2+) concentrations. The concentration of total nitrogen (TN) is higher in summer than in winter. In summer, sulfate accumulates in the middle layer of the sedimentary column, while in winter, the maximum concentration of sulfate in the surface layer reaches 0.65 mmol/L. These geochemical gradients drive the biological transformation of nitrogen, sulfur, and iron, may also be linked to the consumption of methane. Thus, it is established that the temporal and spatial dynamics of methanogenic communities in sediments significantly influence the fluctuations in methane release fluxes within reservoirs, highlighting the necessity to account for seasonal biological variations when assessing greenhouse gas emissions from reservoirs.

AB  - Inter-regional electricity flows have mitigated the mismatch between electricity generation and demand. How-ever, not only environmental impact transfers but also economic benefits are embodied in electricity flows. Whether electricity flows affect the equity of regional economic-environmental sustainability, the exploration is not sufficient. In this paper, a multi-model framework has developed to trace the transfers of electricity envi-ronmental impacts (measured by metal-water-carbon) and economic benefits (measured by valued added) and the degree of equity in the economic-environmental sustainability embodied in electricity flows of China. The results reveal significant asymmetry between where the electricity metal-water-carbon and the electricity value added embodied in electricity flows are transferred. In total, 15.0%, 17.4% and 13.1% of consumption-based electricity metal-water-carbon were outsourced through the electricity flow network, respectively, while only 9.3% of consumption-based electricity value added was outsourced. Wealthier provinces (e.g., Beijing and Guangdong) outsourced a large share of electricity metal-water-carbon to other provinces through the electricity flow network but retained a large share of electricity value added. The REI index between the electricity metal -water-carbon and the electricity value added indicates that money and environmental impacts flowing in the opposite directions have higher inequity. Some provinces, including Shaanxi (the highest REI value at 2.02 was observed for Shaanxi-Gansu), have gained economic benefits from electricity flows, exploiting the advantages of their electricity structures. This study offers insights into helping policymakers better address the potential environmental and economic implications of electricity flows to ensure the sustainable growth of electricity production and consumption.

AB  - The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is an important social index number, central to monetary policy, well being measurement, optimal pricing, and tax and contract escalation. Shelter costs have a large weight in the CPI, so their movements receive much attention. The CPI incorporates two shelter indexes: Rent, covering renters, and Owners' Equivalent Rent (OER), covering owners. Between 1999 and 2006, Rent and OER inflation twice diverged markedly; this occurred again recently. Because these indexes share a common data source-a large sample of market rents-such divergence often prompts questions about CPI methods, particularly the OER utilities adjustment. (This adjustment is necessary to produce an unbiased OER index, because many market rents include utilities, but OER is a rent-of-shelter concept.) The utilities adjustment procedure is no smoking gun. It was not the major cause of these divergences, and it generates no long-run inflation measurement bias. Nonetheless, it increases OER inflation volatility and can drive OER inflation far from its measurement goal in the short run. This article develops a theory of utilities adjustment and outlines a straightforward improvement of Bureau of Labor Statistics procedures that eliminates their undesirable properties. The short-run impact on inflation measurement can be very sizable.

It is shown here that, for an optimal regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, a closed-loop feedback control system based on climate models is necessary. Furthermore, the concept of the Internal Model Principle (IMP) is crucial in attaining the proposed limits of the temperature increase. This is due to the presence of inaccuracies in the existing climate models, and to a lack of knowledge.

AB  - Climate policy uncertainty (CPU) has been a topical issue given its widespread impacts, but its effect on corporate investment efficiency is arguable. Based on a sample of Chinese listed firms, we find that higher CPU results in lower investment levels while higher investment sensitivity to investment opportunities. This suggests that CPU improves investment efficiency by pushing firms to reduce investment expenditures and align their investment decisions more in line with investment opportunities. We name this finding as the pushback effect of CPU and find that it is more pronounced for firms with overinvestment or tight financial conditions.

AB  - Regional inequality significantly infiuences sustainable development and human well-being. In China, there exists pronounced regional disparities in economic and digital advancements; however, scant research delves into the interplay between them. By analyzing the economic development and digitalization gaps at regional and city levels in China, extending the original Cobb-Douglas production function, this study aims to evaluate the impact of digitalization on China's regional inequality using seemingly unrelated regression. The results indicate a greater emphasis on digital inequality compared to economic disparity, with variable coefficients of 0.59 for GDP per capita and 0.92 for the digitalization index over the past four years. However, GDP per capita demonstrates higher spatial concentration than digitalization. Notably, both disparities have shown a gradual reduction in recent years. The southeastern region of the Hu Huanyong Line exhibits superior levels and rates of economic and digital advancement in contrast to the northwestern region. While digitalization propels economic growth, it yields a nuanced impact on achieving balanced regional development, encompassing both positive and negative facets. Our study highlights that the marginal utility of advancing digitalization is more pronounced in less developed regions, but only if the government invests in the digital infrastructure and education in these areas. This study's methodology can be utilized for subsequent research, and our findings hold the potential to the government's regional investment and policy-making.

AB  - The main objective of this study is to get the asymmetric effects of environmental policy stringency on CO2 emissions in top emitter's economies named China, USA, India, Russia, and Japan by using non-linear panel ARDL approach. The non-linear model infers that an increase in environmental policy stringency improves the environmental quality by reducing CO2 emissions in the long run. While a negative change in environmental policy stringency is also reducing the CO2 emissions in the long run. Indeed the asymmetric effects between positive and negative change in the environmental policy stringency are also confirmed in magnitude only in the long-run, thus the policymakers should consider positive as well as negative changes while devising the rules and regulations related to the environment. The study suggests that the high polluted economies need to revisit green environmental regulations policies.

Design/methodology/approach - The sample consists of 897 annual observations from 238 firms from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru for 2018-2020. The data were collected from the Refinitiv database. The proposed model and hypotheses were tested using the feasible generalized least squares estimation technique with heteroscedasticity and panel-specific AR1 autocorrelation. Findings - The results reveal that the presence of CSR committees positively influences the SDGs. Gender diversity positively moderates the relationship between CSR committees and SDGs. Leverage and firm size also positively impact the SDGs. On the other hand, board size and CEO duality negatively affect SDGs disclosure. Research limitations/implications - This study extends the scope of stakeholder theory by suggesting that CSR committees and gender diversity enable a better relationship for the firm with its stakeholders.Practical implications - The findings support policymakers and managers in improving sustainability disclosure. In addition, the results demonstrate the importance of CSR committees and gender diversity to meet the stakeholders' demands.Social implications - This study demonstrates how firms can improve sustainability issues through gender diversity and CSR committees.Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study complements previous literature by being the first to examine the moderating effect of gender diversity on the association between CSR committees and SDGs disclosure in the Latin American context.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the efficiency of the countries over the period of 10 years by applying data envelopment analysis (DEA). Based on rational and factual parameters such as freedom of press, freedom of religion, percentage of export in Gross Domestic Product (GDP), index of globalization, life expectancy at birth, gender ratio etc., this paper attempts to measure the efficiency of happiness. A combination of social and economic factors has been used to measure technical efficiency. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it measures the relative efficiency of all the countries included in the study. The nations have been ranked as per their relative efficiency and the peer group has been formed. Second a comparison between the rich and the poor countries have been done to test empirically whether the economic growth enhances the happiness among people. Presently, more than 3,000 studies have been published on happiness and Veenhoven in 2004 created a database called World Database of Happiness. The World Database of Happiness has attempted to present the available research findings on happiness. Part of the findings on happiness in nations is available in 'States of nations'. For the research purpose, States of Nations and the data published by have been considered. Although happiness has been quantified and the existing literature has sufficient empirical evidences of the same, in the present context, the relative efficiency has been calculated for the countries on basis of objective and subjective happiness parameters. As per the literature, happiness has two aspects (1) objective and (2) subjective. Objective parameters are external to the individuals and covers material living parameters viz. GDP growth, income, nutrition, mortality rate, literacy etc. However, Subjective indicators measure the quality of life of the individuals. These are summarized as ''subjective well-being''. The various parameters considered in the study capture different aspects of happiness. The result shows how the government can increase the happiness of the people by analyzing the behavior and expectations. People express their preference explicitly about political parties, religion believes, law and order situation, trust in official institutions etc. Although, the behavior of people largely depends upon availability of goods and services in the market, the government can make budgets according to priority or preferences of people. Another way to increase happiness can be done by analyzing the peer group, which is an outcome of DEA. This shows the nations which are similar in terms of their economic and social conditions. The government can compare the prevailing conditions in different countries that improve the condition in their respective country. This could be an effective method as some of the parameters can be replicable in order to make people happier. The limitation of this study is lack of availability of data for many countries. As the number of countries increases, a change in the relative efficiency can be observed. Therefore, a future study can be conducted where the relevant data can be collected and a more global result can be obtained.

AB  - The success of global climate initiatives (SDG-13, COP28) heavily depends on the actions of major fossil fuels consuming countries, as their continued reliance on these energy sources greatly impedes progress towards global climate objectives. Transitioning from the dominance of fossil fuels to the expansion of renewable energy is crucial for ensuring Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Conference on Parties (COP) objectives under UN climate change initiatives, as well as for achieving environmental sustainability. This study investigates the proactive role of renewable energy in enhancing environmental sustainability and evaluates the impact of fossil fuel consumption, real gross domestic product (RGDP), square of RGDP, and patents on carbon emissions in major fossil fuels consuming countries from 1990 to 2020 after considering and disregarding the EKC model. Two-way additive and interactive fixed effect models demonstrate a statistically significant negative effect of renewable energy on carbon emissions. A method of moments quantile regression endorses the asymmetric negative effects of renewable energy across different quantiles of CO2 emissions. According to the quantile regression, a low CO2 emitting country's environmental quality is largely sensitive to the consumption of renewable energy. Also, after considering heterogeneity, cross-sectional dependence and endogeneity issues, the effect of renewable energy remains unchanged. On the contrary, unlike renewable energy, fossil fuel consumption, real GDP, square of real GDP, and patents have positive effects in most cases, worsening environmental quality by increasing CO2 levels. Therefore, based on these findings, our study emphasizes pivotal policy implications aimed at fostering a better environment in major fossil fuels consuming countries.

AB  - Subordinate governments act as both agents of superior environmental policies and economic development leaders of the areas under their jurisdiction. The effectiveness of superior-level environmental policy is determined by the degree the subordinate governments are motivated to strengthen environmental regulation. Bottom-up punishment is introduced in the traditional top-down financial rewards to form a two-way atmospheric quality punishment incentive mechanism for the subordinate governments to improve environmental regulation. We take the atmospheric quality punishment incentive implemented in Shandong Province as a case, and the results show that the prefectural governments were encouraged to improve environmental regulation. However, the emission reductions were observed along with the decreased economic output in pollution intensive firms, not based on decreased intensity of key atmospheric pollutant emissions. In this case, the weighting and penalty price established for key pollutants should be increased, so that the subordinate governments can better assume the role of superior environmental policy agent.

AB  - Transnational climate governance (TCG) is an example of complex governance in which national governments no longer serve as reliable gatekeepers between nonstate and subnational actors and global governance. The articles in this special issue demonstrate that TCG and complex governance do not eliminate the importance of domestic political institutions and actors in explaining national variation in engagement with TCG. Rich democracies provide the most favorable political setting for participation in TCG. National policies that favor climate change mitigation produce greater engagement with TCG on the part of nonstate and subnational actors. The same political ecology that produces favorable national policies supports TCG participation: NGO presence and activism, affluent consumers that encourage corporations to engage with TCG, subnational governments with political incentives and fiscal space to undertake cross-border activism. Although direct effects by TCG on greenhouse gas emissions may be limited, TCG may have longer-run and second-order effects that are larger, particularly if commitments are more precise and binding. Overall, TCG illustrates a complementary rather than competitive relationship between national governments and complex governance, a relationship that should be investigated in other issue areas.

AB  - Carbon sequestration capacity of vegetation plays an important role in global carbon emission reduction. Based on vegetation carbon sequestration, this paper establishes a carbon footprint pressure index to evaluate the carbon foot-print pressure in 60 sample countries, and discusses the driving factors that influence carbon footprint pressure in various countries through IPAT equation and Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index decomposition approach. The results indicate that the global carbon footprint pressure shows an upward trend from 2000 to 2015, mainly owing to population growth and rapid socioeconomic development; technological progress has a certain inhibitory effect on the rise of carbon footprint pressure. Furthermore, the overall carbon footprint pressure in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries shows a downward trend, while the carbon footprint pressure in non-OECD countries is rising, even exceeding the economic growth rate, which is probably related to the transfer of a large number of implied carbon emissions from OECD countries to non-OECD countries.

AB  - There is a close relationship between solar activity and the Earth's surface temperature, but this relationship has weakened with recent global warming. To better understand this puzzle, temperature records need to be extended, and the relationship between long-term variation in temperature and solar activity needs to be examined. In this study, we reconstruct April-September temperature variation back to 1563 using tree ring maximum late wood density (MXD) data from Balfour spruce in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP). Spatial correlation analysis indicates that our reconstruction is representative of temperature variability over the large-scale TP. On the 22 year time scale, the reconstructed April-September temperature corresponds generally to solar activity over the past three centuries. Spectral analyses also indicate that the significant periodicities of similar to 11years, 54years, and 204years observed in the MXD chronology correspond to the Schwabe cycle, the fourth harmonic of the Suess cycle, and the Suess solar cycle, respectively. However, disparities between temperature change and solar activity are identified in two periods, the 1880s-1900s and the 1980s-present. These results suggest that solar forcing is the critical driver for long-term temperature variability in the TP, but other factors may uncouple surface temperature and solar activity in some periods. One possible cause of the weak effect of solar activity on temperature during the 1880s-1900s is internal climate variability, while human-activity-induced greenhouse gas emissions have likely superseded solar forcing as the major driver of the rapid warming observed since the 1980s.

AB  - What would it mean to put environmental sustainability at the heart of education? This article describes a process of inclusive, participatory manifesto-making to identify young people's (aged 16-18 years) and teachers' priorities for education for environmental sustainability across the UK. Drawing on analysis of qualitative data from over 200 teachers and young people who participated in futures and visualisation workshops, we identify key educational priorities at the levels of classroom, school, community and policy, based on consensus between teacher and youth perspectives. Whilst consensus-seeking comes with a risk of favouring 'soft' actions which reinforce unsustainable practices and systems, the process of identifying more desirable futures and immediate barriers that must be negotiated to reach them has the potential to create spaces for more critical pedagogies and practices. There is a need for policy makers and school leaders to recognise the interests of teachers and young people to enable greater participation in decision making at different scales, and to ensure that those with the greatest capacity bear their burden of responsibility for education for environmental sustainability.

AB  - Energy efficiency in buildings is a crucial lever for lowering greenhouse gas emissions and a mass market for silica aerogel as retrofitting material. Their durability is therefore a major concern. When applying the precautionary principle, industrial companies have difficulties in estimating the service lifetime of innovative materials such as aerogel. Thus, their costs remain high and market penetration low until the durability of the materials they produce is confirmed. In this paper, commercial silica aerogels were exposed to accelerated ageing over long periods. Microstructural evolutions were tracked by nitrogen and water sorption while thermal conductivities were characterized by heat fluxmeter measurements. 96 and 384 days at 70 degrees C and 90%RH were sufficient to produce noticeable changes in the physico-chemical properties of certain products but almost none in others. The first change observed was an increase of hydrophilicity, followed by a loss of specific surface area, and a shifted and enlarged pore size distribution. The measurements confirmed that microstructure changes induce higher thermal conductivities. Depending on the specific type of aerogel product, the accelerated ageing tests lead to a significant, but limited increase of thermal conductivity of up to 2,5 mW/(m.K). The main hypotheses for explaining this phenomenon are the growth of neck size between two silica particles and the presence of water in the pores. In addition, it is shown for the first time for a wide range of aerogels that pore size distribution and hydrophobization are the key parameters for tuning aerogel durability in severe conditions. Consequently, the mesoporous community has a framework of tests and mechanisms to design aerogels for their specific efficiency/cost/durability requirements.

AB  - Greenhouse gas emissions and global warming have become vital problems to human society. About 40% of the carbon dioxide is emitted from electric power generation in the United States. Due to the lack of consideration in the system design and the lack of a real time systematic management method for energy consumption, the energy efficiency of industrial manufacturing systems is extremely low. Most of the existing research work related to energy efficiency improvement only focuses on a single-machine manufacturing system while little work has been done to achieve the optimal energy efficiency for a typical system with multiple machines and buffers. In this paper, an analytical model is developed to establish a systems (or holistic) view of energy efficiency in typical manufacturing systems with multiple machines and buffers that dynamically control energy consumption considering both energy states and production constraints. The complex interaction between the adopted energy control decisions and system state evolutions are modeled by Markov Decision Process. An approximate algorithm for the real time application is introduced to find a near-optimal solution. A numerical case study on a section of an assembly line is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB  - Coal-fired power plants are the main source of global electricity. As environmental regulations tighten, there is need to improve the design, operation and control of existing or new built coal-fired power plants. Modelling and simulation is identified as an economic, safe and reliable approach to reach this objective. In this study, a detailed dynamic model of a 500 MWe coal-fired subcritical power plant was developed using gPROMS based on first principles. Model validations were performed against actual plant measurements and the relative error was less than 5%. The model is able to predict plant performance reasonably from 70% load level to full load. Our analysis showed that implementing load changes through ramping introduces less process disturbances than step change. The model can be useful for providing operator training and for process troubleshooting among others. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Microcogeneration systems guarantee the reduction of primary energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in residential sector, by reducing fossil fuels demand and grid losses with respect to conventional energy conversion systems. Energy, environmental and economic benefits can be obtained sharing the cogenerated thermal and electric energy among different end-users to increase the operating hours of the microcogeneration plant with respect to the scenario in which energy demand of each end-user is satisfied by a single cogeneration system. This paper analyses a microcogeneration system used to satisfy electric, space heating and domestic hot water demands of two separate residential buildings located in Spain in a load sharing approach. It consists of a natural gas fuelled internal combustion engine with a thermal and electric power of 12.5 kW and 5.5 kW, respectively. An auxiliary boiler with a nominal thermal power of 24 kW, is also included. The domestic hot water and the heating requirements are managed by means of two different thermal energy storages. The proposed energy conversion systems were experimentally analysed in a test facility in Vitoria Gasteiz (Spain). The models representing the components and the buildings have been implemented in TRNSYS 17. The energy, environmental and economic performance of proposed system are compared with those achieved by a traditional system based on separated energy production. The results highlight that the load sharing between users with different load profiles leads to better environmental and thermo-economic results with respect to the conventional system. The microcogeneration plant works for about 3000 hours per year achieving a primary energy saving of 12.1% and a reduction of equivalent CO2 emissions equal to 27.8%. The payback period of the analysed solution is equal to 11.9 years unless economic support mechanisms are considered. The results of this study show that the introduction of a microcogeneration system in load sharing approach leads to energy, environmental and economic benefits even considering two separate residential buildings, occupied by users with different behaviour.

AB  - In Ecuador, the growth of the transportation sector has significantly increased greenhouse gas emissions. According to experts, this sector currently contributes to 49.8% of total greenhouse gas emissions in this country. This poses significant challenges for environmental sustainability, emphasizing the urgent need for effective strategies to mitigate these emissions and promote environmentally friendly practices. Therefore, this study focuses on developing a dynamic simulation of energy scenarios for the year 2035 in the transportation sector, with the goal of transitioning to sustainable mobility, as fossil fuels are the main pollutants in the country. This study proposes system dynamics models using VENSIM 6.0b software to estimate the total energy demand and pollutant emissions in the transportation sector. The results suggest that if Ecuador aligns with global mobility trends and implements public policies promoting the use of electric vehicles, total CO2 emissions could potentially decrease from 50,161,432 kilobarrels of oil equivalent (kBOE) to 20,589,720 kBOE by the year 2035.

AB  - The dynamic soil properties for soil health (DSP4SH) is a Science of Soil Health Initiative that was designed to collect, process, and publicize scientifically rigorous datasets that inform sound indicators and interpretations. The Soil and Plant Science Division of the United States Department of Agriculture - Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS) and university cooperators collected a suite of standardized soil health metrics across eight states (Oregon, Washington, Kansas, Minnesota, Illinois, Connecticut, North Carolina, and Texas) within five soil survey regions (Northwest, North Central, Northeast, Southeast, and South Central). The DSP4SH database provides a substantial dataset of soil health metrics assessed. The dataset is composed of dynamic soil properties (DSP) data collected from each management system or ecological state represented by one to three independent plot replicates. Each plot has a minimum of three pedons. Nine groups from the DSP4SH monitoring network provided datasets used in developing the database. The submitted data includes 37 laboratory measured parameters, 60 variables of layer/horizon descriptions, 41 variables for laboratory analysis conducted at the Kellogg Soil Survey laboratory, and 12 variables for the management systems. An additional 31 variables were developed for site or plot description. Additional variables were developed to normalize the dataset. In preparation for DSP assessment, all tables (except for dataset from KSSL lab) were categorized by management system or ecological state. The categories were business as usual (BAU), the reference condition (Ref) and the soil health management (SHM). The overarching goal of DSP4SH phase 1 and 2 dataset publication is to promote increased accessibility, further analysis of the data, and overall understanding of the benefits of surveying dynamic soil properties for soil health.

AB  - Many climate models predict that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions may cause a threshold response of the North Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (MOC). These model predictions are, however, uncertain. Reducing this uncertainty can have an economic value, because it would allow for the design of more efficient risk management strategies. Early information about the MOC sensitivity to anthropogenic forcing (i.e., information that arrives before the system is committed to a threshold response) could be especially valuable. Here the focus is on one particular kind of information: the detection of anthropogenic MOC changes. It is shown that an MOC observation system based on infrequent (decadal scale) hydrographic observations may well fail in the task of early MOC change detection. This is because this system observes too infrequently and the observation errors are too large. More frequent observations and reduced observation errors would result in earlier detection. It is also shown that the economic value of information associated with a confident and early prediction of an MOC threshold response could exceed the costs of typically implemented ocean observation systems by orders of magnitude. One open challenge is to identify a feasible observation system that would enable such a confident and early MOC prediction across the range of possible MOC responses.

AB  - We analyse the extent and evolution of informality and inequality in the Serbian labour market between 2002 and 2007, using data from the Living Standard Measurement Surveys. Two surprising results emerge. First, the level of informal employment has risen significantly over the period, despite strong economic growth and the introduction of a range of market-oriented reforms. Secondly, the level of inequality in earnings seems to have remained more or less constant over the period, in contrast to the experience of other countries at a similar stage of transition. We show that informal employees earn significantly less than those in the formal sector, controlling for a range of other variables, and informality plays an increasingly important role in explaining earnings inequality.

AB  - Background: Manufacturers of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) are facing new challenges that compel them to outperform their competitors economically, and to consider environmental and social impacts. Customer demands regarding sustainability are channelled upstream to these manufacturers through retailers. This resulted in manufacturers being very conscious of the sustainability of their production processes, as well as their packaging. To that extent, FMCG manufacturers are encouraged to integrate sustainability, with other supply chain partners, to improve sustainability performance across the supply chain. Aim: The purpose of this study is to explore the extent to which FMCG manufacturers in South Africa apply sustainability to their supply chain integration. Setting: The study was conducted among South African FMCG manufacturers. Method: The study applied a generic qualitative research design. Altogether 12 semi-structured interviews were conducted with middle to senior supply chain managers. Results: Having a clear sustainability focus, supported by leadership and embedded into the corporate culture, is key to integrating sustainability internally and thus improving the sustainability performance. The findings indicate that customers do not pressure firms to adhere to their sustainability expectations. Instead, sustainability expectations are driven internally. Firms find it difficult to align the three sustainability aspects equally, due to the local variables and context in which they operate. Therefore, economic sustainability is considered most important and firms act on environmental and social sustainability aspects within strict economic constraints. Conclusion: Academically, the study adds to the literature by creating an understanding of sustainable supply chain integration (SSCI) from a South African perspective. For practitioners, the study encourages firms to collaborate with supply chain partners on sustainability, as this opens up opportunities to create shared value through joint sustainability problem-solving.

AB  - In China, forestry logging and wood processing produce hundreds of thousands of tons of sawdust every year, which is either discarded or burned. These nonecofriendly practices result in some challenges associated with greenhouse gas emissions. Sawdust-based biochar tailored for anodes of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) can effectively realize value-added utilization of sawdust. The purpose of the current work is to prepare TiO2/biochar nanocomposites to improve the electrical conductivity and structural stability of the anode. However, poor interfacial interaction between TiO2 and carbon in the TiO2/C composites arising from their heterogeneous nature leads to structural deformation of the composites used as anodes of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). A strategy of constructing ionic liquid-coupled biochar/TiO2 interfaces is proposed to obtain chemically bonded interfaces between TiO2 and sawdust-derived biochar. In this study, TiO2/C-880 composites are prepared by one-step carbonization of TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) and sawdust at 880 degrees C previously dissolved in 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium ([Bmim]H2PO4)/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The morphologies of TiO2/C-880 demonstrate that the TiO2 is encapsulated by porous biochar with intimate interfaces, and the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results indicate the formation of N-Ti-O/N-O-Ti and Ti-O-P bonds that bridge the two components. TiO2/C-880 electrodes have high reversible specific capacities (404 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1)) and desirable long-term cyclic stability (100 mAh g(-1) at 2 A g(-1) throughout 2500 cycles). Moreover, large diffusion coefficients (DLi+) ranging from 5.9 x 10(-11) to 1.2 x 10(-9) cm(2) s(-1) are obtained from galvanostatic intermittent titration (GITT) curves. The N-Ti-O/N-O-Ti and Ti-O-P bonds at the interfaces offer routes for fast Li+/electron transport, which account for the high performance of the TiO2/C-880 electrodes. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Understanding mechanisms allowing plants to thrive in challenging conditions is critical for predicting their responses to global environmental change. An often overlooked ecological adaptation is marcescence, where leaves and stems are retained beyond their typical shedding time, with implications for nutrient recycling and carbon sequestration. Marcescence can be expected in plants with conservative resource-use strategies, especially in environments with limited resources and marked seasonality, such as deserts and alpine regions. However, the extent to which marcescence occurs in different taxa across different habitats and its relationship to seasonality and plant functioning as reflected in ecophysiological traits remains understudied. We studied 600 individuals across 40 Himalayan herb species found in desert, steppe, alpine and subnival habitats, spanning 3000-5400 m elevation. Marcescence was observed in 37 of the 40 species evaluated, with 57% of the sampled individuals displaying dead phytomass, indicating the widespread nature of this phenomenon in Himalayan ecosystems. Environment and plant traits emerged as significant factors influencing the amount of dead-standing biomass. These findings remained robust after accounting for intraspecific variation and phylogenetic inertia. Desert and steppe species exhibited greater marcescent biomass, characterized by 10-fold more dead stem biomass than alpine and subnival plants. In contrast, the proportion of dead phytomass increased with elevation due to increased dead leaf fraction. Taller desert species with heavily lignified stems and limited nitrogen and phosphorus content had high levels of stem marcescence, which not only may aid litter photodegradation and nutrient recycling but also deter herbivory and promote seed dispersal (tumbleweed). Conversely, slow-growing alpine and subnival plants with higher water-use efficiency, foliar C:N ratios and parenchymatic storage tissue rich in mobile carbohydrates had a high proportion of marcescent leaves, which may aid survival in these resource-limited environments by providing delayed nutrients through moisture-conserving mulch that also provides insulation and protection from frost. This study provides new insights into the complex interplay of habitat, seasonality and plant traits in dead phytomass retention in Himalayan plants. Marcescence is prevalent in resource-conservative species in highly seasonal, resource-limited habitats and may significantly shape the functioning and biodiversity of Himalayan ecosystems.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Mineral development has contributed greatly to China's economic and social development. Many challenges remain, however, including environmental pollution and resource waste in practice, as well as a dearth of systematic theoretical research. The goal of this study is to analyze the economic and social effects of various mineral developments in China from diversified perspectives, so as to provide the basis for the formulation of China's mineral development policy. The input-output effects, industrial linkage effects and income distribution effects of different mining industries are quantitatively analyzed by adopting basic hypotheses of input-output economics, industrial linkage model and income distribution antitheses based on the latest available official data from China Statistical Yearbook from 2004 to 2010 and the 2007 Input-Output Table of China. The empirical results obtained in this study indicate that all mineral development industries, especially coal mining and washing, and petroleum and natural gas extraction industries, have given a strong impetus to the increase of China's fixed asset investment and GDP. Moreover, they have provided a large number of jobs, thereby alleviating ongoing employment pressure, and they have also played a positive role in promoting China's technology investment. The analysis of industrial linkages demonstrates that mining industries are basic to the national economy and produce a significant impetus to its downstream industries, but create weak pull effects in terms of national economic development. From the perspective of income distribution, mining industries play an important role in increasing China's fiscal revenue and per capital income. Hence, China's mineral development policy should (1) encourage additional investment in technology for exploration and development to insure sufficient supply and expand the input effects; (2) attract additional talent to work in remote regions; (3) optimize the industrial structure and promote the industrial transformation in resource regions; (4) adjust the interest distribution between the central and local governments to enable the local regions to become more self-sufficient; and (5) enhance the legal environment so that companies can more readily undertake their social responsibilities voluntarily.

AB  - An enduring debate in the political economy of development turns upon the question of whether trade-offs exist between economic growth and the equitable provision of basic human needs (such as adequate nutrition, shelter, and education) in poor areas. Much of the empirical work on this "growth-welfare" debate has supported the argument that improvements in basic welfare and enhanced economic performance are mutually reinforcing processes. But if the relationships between improved welfare and factors of growth have been fruitfully examined, the effects of growth and growth-oriented policies upon subsequent levels of poverty and inequality are less clear, In a past issue of this journal, political scientists Bruce E. Moon and William J. Dixon argue that higher rates of economic growth do not improve a nation's ability to meet the basic needs of its population. However, two problems undermine Moon and Dixon's analysis and cast doubt upon the accuracy of their conclusions. I address this concern, constructing and estimating a dynamic model of the impact of growth upon basic welfare that tries to account for these problems. The findings confirm Moon and Dixon's general conclusion, but suggest that the impact of growth related factors upon basic needs outcomes may be less enduring than they had supposed, with beneficial consequences of either positive externalities or effective government intervention (or both) soon out-weighing any detrimental effects of sustained growth.

AB  - This paper explores the effect of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) on industrial pollution using China's real-time pollution data and a novel news-based EPU index constructed by Davis, Liu, and Sheng (2019). Empirical results suggest that EPU can significantly promote sulfur dioxide (SO2) readings in cities experiencing higher ex-ante fiscal pressure, and this effect is more profound during the daytime. Given that SO2 is the main contributor to industrial pollution, and local governments have less incentive to monitor illegal pollutant discharges during the nighttime period, our findings indicate that rising EPU will harm the environment by motivating local authorities to reduce environmental supervision and thus increase industrial pollution. We also find that promoting regional innovation and strengthening external environmental regulations can mitigate the pollution effect of economic policy uncertainty.

AB  - The present paper contributes to the debate on eco-innovations (EIs) by comparing their role within the framework of two contrasting theoretical perspectives: the neoclassical vs. the evolutionary viewpoint. In the neoclassical approach, EIs play a crucial role in achieving the goal of environmental sustainability mainly through their contribution to the technological progress that can offset the negative effects of the exhaustion of natural resources. By contrast, evolutionists analyse EIs in their dynamic and multi-dimensional nature, recognising the important role played by organisational, social, and institutional innovations for environmental sustainability. In this framework, the deterministic neoclassical perspective seems to be particularly useful to investigate specific characteristics of EIs, such as efficiency and role of environmental regulation. By contrast, the evolutionary theories are suitable to investigate radical innovations and to avoid any technology bias, by stressing the need for consideration of social and institutional dimensions.

AB  - Salt marshes are an integral part of coastal ecosystems that are changing rapidly with sea level rise (SLR). Because marshes provide important ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration and shoreline protection, it is critical to understand how their economic benefit values are likely to be affected by SLR. Such change, however, depends on the capacity of marshes to adapt to flooding by migrating inland. This study provides the economic value of changes in carbon and non-carbon benefits using predicted changes in salt marsh coverage in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island under three SLR scenarios and two marsh adaptation conditions. We apply regional carbon prices and a value function transfer approach to value other salt marsh service values. Results indicate an average annual value of $1,863/acre for carbon and $2,537/acre for non-carbon ecosystem services. This yields a mean discounted value of $592 million (M) (+14% compared to no change) over 90 years. We discuss alternative management strategies to enhance marshes' capacity to migrate inland, which may accrue as much as $659 M.

AB  - Firearm injury is a major cause of death, disability, and other harms to community well-being across the U.S. Economics and public health offer two complementary perspectives to conceptualize gun violence and formulate strategies to mitigate related harms. Economics offers methods and procedures for tabulating costs of firearm injury and offers an explicit, albeit imperfect normative framework to evaluate proposed interventions. Economics' focus on incentives, trade-offs, and resources constraints provides useful mechanisms for understanding illegal firearm markets and firearm use that can inform crime reduction efforts. Public health methods and interventions help to measure patterns of illness and disease, identify risks and protective factors, and inform prevention efforts for the most vulnerable individuals and communities. Public health also focuses attention on social determinants and structural factors in designing and evaluating interventions to prevent, address, and mitigate the consequences of gun violence.

AB  - Short rotation woody crops (SRWCs) including Populus species and their hybrids (i.e., poplars) are ideal for incorporating biomass production with phytotechnologies such as phytoremediation. To integrate these applications, 15 poplar plantings from nine long-term phytoremediation installations were sampled from 2012 to 2013 in the Midwest (Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin) and Southeast (Alabama, Florida, North Carolina) United States. In this review, we report summary results of this sampling and how performance at each site compared with comparable phytoremediation systems in the literature. We review significant genotypic differences from each planting within the context of provisioning (i.e., biomass production) and regulating (i.e., carbon sequestration) ecosystem services and how they relate to the need for a cleaner environment during times of accelerated ecological degradation. Overall, the contaminated poplar sites provided these ecosystem services comparable to noncontaminated poplar sites used for bioenergy and biofuels feedstock production. For example, phytoremediation trees at the Midwestern sites had biomass values ranging from 4.4 to 15.5 Mg ha(-1) y(-1), which was 20% less relative to bioenergy trees (p = .0938). Results were similar for diameter and carbon, with some genotype x environment interactions resulting in phytoremediation trees exhibiting substantially greater growth and productivity (i.e., +131% at one site). As illustrated in the current review, phytoremediation success can be increased with the identification and deployment of genotypes tailored to grow well and tolerate a broad diversity of contaminants (generalists) (i.e., 'DN34', 'NM6', '7300501') versus those that significantly outperform their counterparts under unique site conditions (specialists) (i.e., '220-5', '51-5', 'S13C20').

AB  - Urban areas' population has grown during the last century and it is expected that over 60% of the world population will live in cities by 2050. Urban parks provide several ecosystem services that are valuable to the wellbeing of city-dwellers and they are also considered a nature-based solution to tackle multiple environmental problems in cities. However, the type and amount of ecosystem services provided will vary with each park vegetation type, even within same the park. Our main goal was to quantify the trade-offs in ecosystem services associated to different vegetation types, using a spatially detailed approach. Rather than relying solely on general vegetation typologies, we took a more ecologically oriented approach, by explicitly considering different units of vegetation structure and composition. This was demonstrated in a large park (44 ha) located in the city of Almada (Lisbon metropolitan area, Portugal), where six vegetation units were mapped in detail and six ecosystem services were evaluated: carbon sequestration, seed dispersal, erosion prevention, water purification, air purification and habitat quality. The results showed that, when looking at the park in detail, some ecosystem services varied greatly with vegetation type. Carbon sequestration was positively influenced by tree density, independently of species composition. Seed dispersal potential was higher in lawns, and mixed forest provided the highest amount of habitat quality. Air purification service was slightly higher in mixed forest, but was high in all vegetation types, probably due to low background pollution, and both water purification and erosion prevention were high in all vegetation types. Knowing the type, location, and amount of ecosystem services provided by each vegetation type can help to improve management options based on ecosystem services trade-offs and looking for win-win situations. The trade-offs are, for example, very clear for carbon: tree planting will boost carbon sequestration regardless of species, but may not be enough to increase habitat quality. Moreover, it may also negatively influence seed dispersal service. Informed practitioners can use this ecological knowledge to promote the role of urban parks as a nature-based solution to provide multiple ecosystem services, and ultimately improve the design and management of the green infrastructure. This will also improve the science of Ecosystem Services, acknowledging that the type of vegetation matters for the provision of ecosystem services and trade-offs analysis.

AB  - This article introduces a specific concept of consumer culture into the international and European discussion about new concepts and categories in comparative education. Basic meanings of consumer culture are presented in reference to consumer research, consumer culture theory, and a revisited concept of world polity. In addition to general reflexions, two educational programs from UNESCO-on sustainable consumption and lifestyles, and on cultural diversity and national cultural heritage-are analyzed to show how education and educational research can benefit from the concept of consumer culture. The article proposes to conceive consumer culture as the educational space of global cultural capitalism.

AB  - The greenhouse gases generated in the wastewater treatment process based on heterotrophic denitrification technology have become a dilemma between water environment protection and carbon emission reduction. Therefore, balancing the removal of nitrate pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions has become a key issue in "green denitrification". Based on the insufficient research of previous studies on C/N and global warming potential (GWP) in denitrification systems, this study constructed a series of batch experiments with different initial C/N to analyze their impact on the denitrifying enzymes specific activity concentration and the GWP caused by GHGs emissions. This study indicates that when the initial C/N is below 6.82, it leads to a decrease in the nitrous oxide reductase specific activity concentration by 0.11 similar to 12.45 %, but an increase in the nitric oxide reductase specific activity concentration by 5.96 similar to 22.01 %. In addition, when the initial C/N was between 2.34 similar to 6.82, the GWP caused by every complete reduction of 1 mg NO3--N has a better cost-effectiveness, with 0.09 similar to 0.13 mmol CO2-eq/mg NO3--N. Overall, the results of the study provide a reference for balancing the nitrate removal and the GWP caused by GHGs emission in wastewater treatment.

AB  - The new digital age introduces a continuous stream of technological innovations. Yet, little is known about how these technological innovations influence workplace behavior. Drawing on the stressor-strain model, this study examined the possibility that emotional exhaustion would explain the effect of technological insecurity on individual performance. This study further posited that leader-member exchange would interact with technological insecurity to influence emotional exhaustion and, through it, individual performance. This study found that technological insecurity negatively associates with individual performance. Results also indicated that emotional exhaustion carries the negative consequences of technological insecurity. This study further found that the effects of technological insecurity attenuate at high levels of leader-member exchange. Finally, this study discussed implications for theory and practices as well as offered future research directions.

AB  - Co-pyrolysis can enhance the sewage sludge sequestrated carbon quantity through the introduction of other carbon containing precursors. In this work, wind turbine blade waste (WTBW) was used to perform a co-pyrolysis system of sludge at 600 degrees C, in presence of activating agent KOH. The optimum mass proportion of WTBW was 40% for carbon material preparation in terms of surface area, and the apparent activation energy. The apparent activation energy was observed to decrease from 53.5 kJ/mol to 33.1 kJ/mol as the WTBW mass proportion increased from 0 to 40%. The maximum BET surface area was found to be 498.3 m(2)/g, whereas, 36% more micro-pores were generated in the carbon mateirals. The major functional groups in the co-pyrolysis carbon material were found to be hydroxyl and aldehydes. The co-pyrolysis of WTBW and sewage sludge will be a promising way to improve the carbon sequestration from sewage sludge. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bioassay incubation experiments conducted with nutrients and local atmospheric aerosol amendments indicate that phosphorus (P) availability limited phytoplankton growth in the low-nutrient low-chlorophyll (LNLC) ocean off Barbados. Atmospheric deposition provides a relatively large influx of new nutrients and trace metals to the surface ocean in this region in comparison to other nutrient sources. However, the impact on native phytoplankton is muted due to the high ratio of nitrogen (N) to P (NO3:SRP>40) and the low P solubility of these aerosols. Atmospheric deposition induces P limitation in this LNLC region by adding more N and iron (Fe) relative to P. This favors the growth of Prochlorococcus, a genus characterized by low P requirements and highly efficient P acquisition mechanisms. A global three-dimensional marine ecosystem model that includes species-specific phytoplankton elemental quotas/stoichiometry and the atmospheric deposition of N, P, and Fe supports this conclusion. Future increases in aerosol N loading may therefore influence phytoplankton community structure in other LNLC areas, thereby affecting the biological pump and associated carbon sequestration.

AB  - Buildings constructed with cross-laminated timber (CLT) are increasing in interest in several countries. Since CLT is a sustainable product, it can help the building industry to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, buildings constructed with CLT are increasing in building height, thereby increasing the load on the junctions and structural building elements further down in the building. Several studies have investigated how the load impacts the sound transmission between apartments. The majority found that an increasing load could have a negative effect on the vertical sound insulation. However, the findings are limited to a few measurements or building elements, and the studies only investigate junctions with resilient interlayers. This article aims to investigate if the building height, and thereby the load, affect the vertical airborne sound insulation between apartments on different stories in different cross-laminated timber buildings, with or without the presence of viscoelastic interlayers, and to quantify the effect. Four CLT buildings with different building systems, building heights, and the presence of viscoelastic interlayers in the junctions were measured. The airborne sound insu-lation between different apartment rooms was measured vertically for stories on the lower and higher levels. The difference in airborne sound insulation was calculated separately for each building, and the measurements indicate that the vertical airborne sound insulation reduces further down in the buildings. Therefore, results show that increasing load, by an increasing number of stories, has a negative effect on the vertical airborne sound insulation.

AB  - The effects of food availability and infection with the microsporidium Nosema adaliae on alkaloid production in the two-spotted lady beetle, Adalia bipunctata L., was examined. Alkaloid production (relative percent adaline in reflex-fluid) and pathogen load (spore counts) were quantified for both uninfected and N. adaliae-infected A. bipunctata. Alkaloid content was significantly higher for beetles fed irregularly than for those fed daily. For beetles infected with N. adaliae, spore counts were significantly higher for those fed irregularly compared to those fed daily. These results suggest that adaline content in reflex-fluid is influenced by infection and that irregular food supply increases pathogen load.

AB  - Winter food supply very likely influences the life history of reindeer Rangifer t. tarandus. We therefore examined how lichen biomass affects winter diet composition, body mass and reproduction in 14 herds of semi-domesticated reindeer in northern Finland. Diet composition was assessed microhistologically on faeces collected from the actual winter feeding sites of reindeer. When lichen was scarce at these sites reindeer included vascular plants and mosses in their diet. Calf dressed weight depended on both ground lichen biomass and the intensity of supplemental feeding, doe dressed weight depended on lichen biomass alone. One explanation for this difference between calves and does is the connection between food supply and calf mortality: low lichen biomass may promote newborn mortality, which, in turn, frees breeding females from investing further in current reproductive investment. Relative offspring weight (calf/female weight ratio) depended on both lichen biomass and supplemental feeding. Low lichen availability appeared to enhance the impact of density-independent factors on reproduction, because the annual variation in reproductive rate increased with decreasing lichen biomass.

AB  - Restoration practices in marginal lands for food production are the most important sustainability challenge for humans at the global level. Nature-based solutions (NBS) are among the best interventions to improve soil health, which directly enhances the soil productivity and biodiversity for improved sustainability of ecosystems. Our field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of three inoculants, two of which were bacterial: Azotobacter chroococcum (T1), Acetobacter diazotrophicus (T2), and the third fungal: Aspergillus awamori (T3) on soil properties, plant biomass, enzymatic activities (phosphatase, dehydrogenase activity), and soil carbon stock in marginal lands. The experimental results clearly revealed that the inoculations significantly enhanced plant growth and biomass (p < 0.01). The soil enzyme (dehydrogenase and phosphatase) activities increased under T3 and T2 treatments in response to inoculation. Interestingly, the significant results were observed in T3 and T1 treatment in the 4th year of observation for soil carbon stock (53.06 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) and 51.41 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively). The total soil carbon stock was found to be 38.60 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) in control plots. The inoculation enhanced (p <= 0.05) the soil biological properties like microbial biomass carbon as 267.62 +/- 18.73 mu gg(-1) to 894.24 +/- 41.65 mu g g(-1). We conclude that selected inoculations in marginal lands can provide a suitable option for eco-restoration and can sequester more atmospheric CO2 in to stable carbon pools to achieve UN Sustainable Development Goals and food security.

AB  - Recognizing the importance of sustainable consumption in addressing the grave challenge of climate change, the present study investigates the effects of non-conscious exposure to money ("money priming") on Sustainable Consumption Attitudes (SCAs). In two experiments we examine money priming's impact on SCAs and assess the role of materialism and altruism as mediating factors. In Experiment I money priming was found to increase materialism and decrease SCAs, although materialism did not mediate this relationship. Experiment II demonstrated that money priming decreased altruism and SCAs, with altruism mediating the effect of money priming on SCAs. We explain how these new research findings extend the existing body of knowledge on the role of money priming in shaping individual values and SCAs and discuss the implications of our results for consumer decision making, marketing strategy, and public policy.

AB  - The photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into high-value chemicals is an ideal pathway to adjust the energy structure and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In this work, we reported a facile synthetic strategy of new photocatalyst (ZnFe2O4/FeP-CTFs), where ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles (NPs) was in situ growth on iron porphyrin covalent triazine-based frameworks (FeP-CTFs) via one-pot ionothermal method. Such strategy can effectively prevent ZnFe2O4 from agglomerating and blocking the pore structure of CTFs. Notably, a series of experiments demonstrated that anchoring sites of FeP-CTFs can effectively promote the crystal-plane ratio of high catalytic performance, in the assistance of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+), promoting higher photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity (178 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) for CO) of the as-prepared ZnFe2O4/FeP-CTFs under visible light compared with pure ZnFe2O4, FeP-CTFs, and their physical mixtures. A combination of experimental measurements and density functional theory calculation reveals that the strong interactions between ZnFe2O4 NPs and FeP-CTFs support can facilitate the charge separation of photogenerated carriers and thereby benefit to photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

AB  - With the objective to reduce fossil fuels consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, the integration of solar thermal energy into energy-intensive processes represents the most effective solution. This paper investigates the best solar integration scenarios to an industrial dryer unit through an exergy analysis. The exergetic balance for each subsystem is conducted, and a sensitivity parametric analysis was carried out. The optimization using the Genetic Algorithm was then conducted to define the optimum solar operating conditions. The exergetic evaluation showed an important exergy destruction at the dryer and combustion chamber, accounting for 58% and 42% of the inlet exergy flow, respectively. The sensitivity analysis outcomes showed that the exergy efficiency is clearly increased by increasing both drying temperature, decreasing the inlet moisture content, with preheating the combustion air temperature. Considering these variables, the optimization problem enabled enhancing the exergy efficiency by 40% and 30% for the overall process and flash dryer, respectively, when increasing drying temperature to 850 degrees C, an inlet moisture content of 14.9% and a preheated air combustion of 150 degrees C. Finally, the solar field could be integrated to the industrial dryer to preheat the ambient air for the combustion chamber to the setpoint temperature of 150 degrees C.

AB  - Energy transition requires actions from different sectors and levels, mainly focused on achieving a low-carbon and high-renewable integration society. Among the different sectors, the transport sector is responsible for more than 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions, mostly emitted in cities. Therefore, initiatives and analysis focused on electric vehicles integration powered by renewables is currently a desirable solution to mitigate climate change and promote energy transition. Under this framework, this paper proposes a multi-indicator analysis for the estimation of CO2 emissions combining renewable integration targets, reduction emission targets and realistic renewable resource potentials. Four scenarios are identified and analyzed: (i) current situation with conventional vehicles, (ii) replacement of such conventional by electric vehicles without renewable integration, (iii) and (iv) integration of renewables to fulfill emission reduction targets for 2030 and 2050 respectively. The analysis is evaluated in the state of Maine (United States). From the results, a minimum renewable penetration of 39% and 82%, respectively, is needed to fulfill the emission reduction targets for 2030 and 2050 by considering 100% conventional vehicle replacement. Different combinations of available renewable resources can reduce emissions by more than 35%.

AB  - The textile industry accounts for approximately 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions. There is a significant opportunity to decarbonize the textile industry by electrification of process heating where low- or zero-carbon electricity is used. Electrified process heating can be achieved through cross-cutting technologies without modifying the textile process equipment and/or through replacing the existing equipment with technologies that employ electromagnetic or resistance heating techniques for specific end-use applications. This paper aims to investigate the potential for electrification of process heating in the textile wet-processing industry in three of the top textile-producing and exporting regions in the world. To do this, two separate technology pathways, i.e., electrification through (a) industrial heat pumps and (b) textile end-use processes are developed and analyzed. The results show that the total potential final energy and CO2 savings due to electrification in both scenarios could be substantially large due to the lower energy intensity of the electrified heating systems. Moreover, the costs per unit of textile production are found to be lower in the case of industrial heat pumps compared to other systems. It is concluded that wide-scale electrification of process heating in the textile wet-processing industry will require major changes to the electricity system and individual sites, and the coordination efforts among different stakeholders to plan these changes must be intensified.

AB  - Key pathways for the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) have remained elusive, particularly in organic rich ecosystems. In this work, the occurrence of AOM driven by humus-catalyzed dissimilatory iron reduction was investigated in sediments from a coastal mangrove swamp. Anoxic sediment incubations supplied with both goethite (alpha-FeOOH) and leonardite (humic substances (HS)) displayed an average AOM rate of 10.7 +/- 0.8 mu mol CH4 cm(-3) day(-1), which was 7 and 3 times faster than that measured in incubations containing only goethite or HS, respectively. Additional incubations performed with C-13-methane displayed Pahokee Peat HS-mediated carbonate precipitation linked to (CH4)-C-13 oxidation and ferrihydrite reduction (similar to 1.3 mu mol carbonate cm(-3) day(-1)). These results highlight the role of HS on mitigating greenhouse gases released from wetlands, not only by mediating the AOM process, but also by enhancing carbon sequestration as inert minerals (calcite, aragonite and siderite).

AB  - We analyse the wood and concrete designs of the Walludden building described by Borjesson et al. (Energy Policy 28 (2000) 575) in terms of their embodied energy, employing an environmentally extended input-output framework in a tiered hybrid life-cycle assessment. and in a structural path analysis. We illustrate the complexity of the inter-industry supply chains underlying the upstream energy requirements for the building options. Land demonstrate that higher-order inputs are difficult to capture in a conventional process analysis. Our Calculations show that Borjesson and Gustavsson's estimates of energy requirements and greenhouse gas emissions are underestimated by a factor of about 2, and that corresponding greenhouse gas balances are positive at about 30 t C-eq. Nevertheless, Borjesson and Gustavsson's general result the concrete-framed building causing higher emissions still holds. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of fireworks as a sign of celebration is a common practice in many countries. During the last few years, this sector has been subjected to various social criticisms that have even led to a ban on their use in different places. One of the main causes is the environmental pollution they generate, due to emissions from combustion reactions associated with the use of pyrotechnic devices. Nitrate ester-based compounds as propellants are used in other solid rockets such as ammunition, but their use in pyrotechnics is currently limited to a small number of fireworks. This research analyses the substitution of black powder with nitrocellulose ([C6H7(NO2)3O5]n) as a propellant for aerial articles, as well as to the use of nitrocellulose as a perchlorate-free compound. In addition to achieving better clarity effects due to less smoke, the use of nitrocellulose reduces greenhouse gas emissions. However, this nitrogen-rich compound is more unstable, and the ignition sensitivity is higher. Therefore, the benefits and risks associated with this alternative compound need to be evaluated, but the evidence shown suggests a promising direction for the sustainable evolution of pyrotechnic compositions.

AB  - Based on polling of citizens of different age groups living in Kyiv, Ternopil, Donetsk, Sumy, Zaporizhia, Poltava and Volyn regions of Ukraine, we tested the hypothesis that there is a low demand for the public good "a clean environment". We found that 60% of citizens are not satisfied with the level of awareness about the ecological situation in their places of residence, and that the Internet is the main source of information for respondents under 45 years old, while for the older generation its place is taken by TV. In general, young people are ready to engage in solving environmental problems and are well informed about the existence of international environmental organizations and movements. Up to 90% of the population is concerned about the threat of the global environmental crisis, and as the main threats they named transport and industry. Approximately 80% of citizens recognize ecology as a public good, but more than 90% are skeptical of the authorities' actions regarding the resolution of environmental problems, and more than 40% of citizens believe that the environmental situation in their places of residence has deteriorated in recent years. Up to 80% of the respondents consider it appropriate to invest in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but only 9% of respondents are ready to make a significant personal contribution to this. The vast majority of the population is ready to make contributions of not more than 1% of income to ensure a high quality environment, and only 35% of respondents are trying to buy environmentally friendly products. In general, the study confirms the hypothesis that there is a low level of demand among Ukrainian citizens for environmentally friendly products and a clean environment. We can explain this situation by the existence of numerous unsolved socio-economic problems of the domestic economy.

AB  - Employee performance and their new ideas, as well as their efforts to promote the company in positive ways help build the values of an enterprise. Properly motivated managers, white-collar, and blue-collar workers use their performance to affect the business efficiency, and therefore the success and sustainability of the enterprise. Selecting the right structure of motivation factors, especially those aimed at job category and gender, is the main role of enterprise management. The aim of this study is to analyze and define differences in the perception of the preferred level of motivation in terms of gender and job category. The questionnaires were given to randomly selected employees working in Slovak enterprises in order to ensure variability and randomness of respondent selection which is necessary for relevant data acquisition. Following the average, the order of the importance of motivation factors of 3720 respondents was defined. The Student's t-test and Tukey's HSD test were used. We confirmed that there are statistically significant differences in the perception of the motivation in terms of job category. Moreover, we proved the significant differences between genders in the job category of blue-collar workers. We did not observe differences between genders in the other job categories studied. The results reported should be accepted and implemented in motivational programs by the employees of human resource departments as a way to keep up with strategic human resource management.

We offer our assessment of the original article and trace its legacy, in particular Nordhaus's later series of DICE' models. From this work, many have drawn the conclusion that an efficient global emissions abatement policy comprises modest and modestly increasing controls. We use DICE itself to provide an initial illustration that, if the analysis is extended to take more strongly into account three essential elements of the climate problem - the endogeneity of growth, the convexity of damage and climate risk - optimal policy comprises strong controls.

AB  - The building sector is considered as the biggest single contributor to world energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, a good understanding of the nature and structure of energy use in buildings is crucial for establishing the adequate future energy and climate change policies. Availability of the updated data is becoming increasingly important in order to allow a rigorous analysis. In this paper, recent data on the world energy consumption in both residential and commercial buildings are reported. Past situation, current status and future trends are discussed and analyzed for selected countries. A breakdown of buildings energy consumption is realized in order to determine the influencing key parameters. A whole section of this paper is dedicated to give an overview of measures and policies adopted by different countries, allowing the monitoring, management and reduction of the energy consumption in buildings. Critical aspects of these policies are discussed based on the feedback of the early adopters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Improvement in energy efficiency is one of the main options to reduce energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. However, large-scale deployment of energy-efficient technologies is constrained by several factors. Employing a survey of 509 industrial and commercial firms throughout Ukraine and a generalized ordered logit model, we quantified the economic, behavioral, and institutional barriers that may impede the deployment of energy-efficient technologies. Our analysis shows that behavioral barriers resulted from lack of information, knowledge, and awareness are major impediments to the adoption of energy-efficient technologies in Ukraine, and that financial barriers may further impede investments in these technologies especially for small firms. This suggests that carefully targeted information provisions and energy audits will enhance Ukrainian firms' investments in energy-efficient technologies to save energy consumption, improve productivity, and reduce carbon emissions from the productive sectors.

AB  - This study evaluates the impact of building orientation, typology, and envelope characteristics on energy efficiency and CO2 emissions in urban dwellings in subtropical climate, with a focus on Cartagena, Colombia. North-facing dwellings consistently demonstrate superior energy performance, achieving an average efficiency increase of 4.27 +/- 1.77% compared to south-facing counterparts. This trend is less pronounced near the equator due to the sun's high zenith angle. Semi-detached homes exhibit 23.17 +/- 9.83% greater energy efficiency than corner houses, attributed to reduced exterior wall exposure, which lowers energy demand and CO2 emissions by 2.16 +/- 0.74 kg CO2/m2 annually. Significant disparities in emissions are observed across socioeconomic strata; homes in strata 3 and 4 show the lowest emissions (6.69 +/- 1.42 kg CO2/m2 per year), while strata 5 and 6 have the highest (10.48 +/- 1.42 kg CO2/m2 per year), due to differences in construction quality and glazing ratios. Roofing materials also play a key role, with thermoacoustic (TAC) roofs reducing emissions by up to 5.80% in lower strata compared to asbestos-cement roofs. Furthermore, sandwich panels demonstrate substantial potential, achieving CO2 emissions reductions of up to 51.6% in strata 1 and 2 south-facing median homes and a minimum saving of 9.4% in strata 5 and 6. These findings underscore the importance of integrating energy performance criteria into public housing policies, promoting construction practices that enhance sustainability and reduce greenhouse gas emissions while improving occupant comfort and property value.

The energy used in road passenger transport enables social and economic development and is the target of interventions to fight pressing urban environmental problems, energy security concerns and dangerous climate change. This review explores a systematic approach to describe interactions documented in the literature, between policies targeting energy use in road passenger transport to reduce petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions and sustainable development goals. Essential, uncertain and limited interactions are mapped out as a result, their overview indicates that a full reconciliation between these policies and sustainability goals is not always attainable. The careful alignment and contextual examination of interactions between measures and goals as exemplified in this approach can help inform practical transport energy policy that better match an agenda for sustainable development.

AB  - A real-life benchmark system comprising a Heat Exchanger Network operated as part of Crude Distillation Unit is considered. In such systems, the crude oil stream is typically split into parallel branches and the oil mass flows through the branches are kept in constant proportion, i.e., at constant split ratio, by the process control system. In this paper, linear control systems (proportional-integral-derivative controllers) are considered and the proposed control strategy is to adjust the parallel flows so that identical temperature values are maintained at the outlets from two parallel branches and consequently, the heat recovery in the network is maximized. The aim is to enhance the energy efficiency of the system and minimise greenhouse gas emissions. A mathematical model of the heat exchanger network was built and validated on the basis of real-life data recorded during operation of the crude distillation unit. Using MATLAB/Simulink, closed-loop control was simulated to enable comparative evaluation of the studied strategy of proportional-integral-derivative control and its potential to achieve energy savings in the operation of the distillation unit under fouling conditions. Compared to the strategy of constant split ratio, the proposed strategy of equal outlet temperatures from the network branches was found to increase the total heat recovery by about 1.5%. In the studied operation period, the heat-recovery increase fluctuated in the range 150-1100 kW and the average daily energy saving was estimated at 18 MWh.

AB  - Over the last years, gas-fired power capacity investments in electricity networks have increased in many countries due to its low-rate of greenhouse gas emissions and the continuous reduction in the natural gas price. Besides, new power-to-gas technologies have attracted attention in the sector as an alternative for harvesting large shares of renewable generation. Thus, the coupling between power and gas networks is becoming more critical. New complementarities arise from the synergies of the co-optimization of both power and natural gas systems operation in terms of reliability, sustainability, and economic efficiency. In this regard, jointly planning of power and natural gas systems could leverage potential benefits for the optimal coordination of both grids. In this survey, we present a comprehensive investigation of recent literature in the contexts of coordinated planning of the gas and electricity systems. We first provide a thorough study of energy systems planning. Later, the planning issues of both power and gas grids are investigated, including modeling aspects, typical operational constraints, and objectives that drive investments, as well as uncertainties associated. Then, international experiences are presented to compare the mathematical approaches to the planning of electricity and natural grids. Finally, discussion about future research opportunities and conclusions are presented.

While mimetic pressures and competitive dynamics have been recognized as drivers of green innovation, the impact of external uncertainties, such as climate change-induced disasters, on these dynamics remains underexplored. This study fills this gap by revealing how firms pursue renewable energy innovation amid competitive pressures and environmental challenges. Utilizing the behavioral theory of the firm and the threat rigidity model, we analyze US firms' pursuit of renewable energy innovation following climatological disasters from 2013 to 2018 through a difference-in-difference-in-differences approach. Our findings reveal that peers' pursuit of renewable energy innovation can dampen a firm's own pursuit of renewable energy innovation postdisaster, and this effect is less pronounced among multinational enterprise subsidiaries. Theoretically, this study deepens our understanding of how climatological disasters shape competitive dynamics and innovation, challenging the view that competition invariably drives innovation. Practically, it provides insights into effective resource allocation and prioritizing collaborations for sustainability. For policy-makers, the findings highlight the need for regulatory environments that encourage collaborative innovation and enhance resilience, directly contributing to Sustainable Development Goal 7 (affordable and clean energy) by promoting sustainable energy use.

AB  - The advent of the sharing/gig economy has created new forms of employment embedded in new labor practices. Advocates of the sharing economy frame it in salutary terms, lauding its sustainability, decentralization, and employment-generation capabilities. The workers of the gig economy are seen as independent contractors under law rather than employees, and the owners of the gig economy platforms celebrate this categorization as a form of entrepreneurship. In this paper, we use insights from the entrepreneurship literature to examine this claim critically. Taking Uber as an exemplar, we look at the arguments behind the company's contention that its drivers are actually "partners" who are engaged in entrepreneurship, and demonstrate why these claims are problematic. We utilize a stakeholders' theory framework that initiates a dialogue between ethics and entrepreneurship in order to focus on the mechanisms that help ensure ethical practices in the sharing economy and to examine the efficacy of these mechanisms. We also discuss the role of the entrepreneurship literature in promoting entrepreneurial behaviors that lead to income inequality. We conclude by arguing that the sharing economy reflects the intensification of an ongoing neoliberal trend that misuses the concept of entrepreneurship in order to justify certain forms of employment practices, and make a case for regulatory oversight.

AB  - In 2002, the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority drew up a long term strategy for improving recycling rates, providing waste processing and achieving resource and energy recovery. This strategy recognises the imperative to reduce disposal of biodegradable waste to landfill and thereby to reduce both greenhouse gas emissions and the carbon dioxide footprint arising from the conventional disposal of municipal waste. To implement the strategy, a 3-8 pound billion, 25-year private finance initiative contract was developed and awarded in April 2009 for the construction and operation of waste disposal facilities to process domestic refuse arising from nine of the ten boroughs within Greater Manchester. The new facilities include 25 household waste recycling centres, seven transfer loading stations, four in-vessel composting plants, a materials recovery facility and five mechanical biological treatment plants. This paper describes environmental benefits arising from the scheme including increased recycling rates, optimisation of carbon impact from transportation, energy from waste (by way of combined heat and power from generating and utilising biogas arising from on-site anaerobic digestion facilities), nutrient capture and recycling (through British Standard PAS100 and Animal By-product Regulations compliant composting) and improved environmental performance (including odour control) of the upgraded facilities.

AB  - The paper presents a life-cycle assessment of costs and greenhouse gas emissions for transit buses deploying a hybrid input-output model to compare ultra-low sulfur diesel to hybrid diesel-electric, compressed natural gas, and hydrogen fuel-cell. We estimate the costs of emissions reductions from alternative fuel vehicles over the life cycle and examine the sensitivity of the results to changes in fuel prices, passenger demand, and to technological characteristics influencing performance and emissions. We find that the alternative fuel buses reduce operating costs and emissions, but increase life-cycle costs. The infrastructure requirement to deploy and operate alternative fuel buses is critical in the comparison of life-cycle emissions. Additionally, efficient bus choice is sensitive to passenger demand, but only moderately sensitive to technological characteristics, and that the relative efficiency of compressed natural gas buses is more sensitive to changes in fuel prices than that of the other bus types.

AB  - The battery electric vehicle's environmental impacts are highly influenced by the emissions attributed to the electricity used to recharge the battery. The electricity generation's environmental assessment, however, is mainly based on static yearly mean shares of primary energy sources. To overcome this uncertainty, we develop a mixed-integer linear programming model to couple variable, hourly environmental impacts of electricity generation with representative user behavior in Germany. The model is then used to quantify and optimize the mitigation potential of environmental impacts for 2019, 2025, 2030, and 2050. Focusing on one method that minimizes the overarching environmental impacts could lead to ambiguous results. Instead, we aim to optimize charging behavior regarding each midpoint category and reveal the conflicting objectives among all the environmental categories that arise when aiming to minimize environmental impacts holistically. Considering greenhouse gas emissions, a reduction of 38% can be achieved through optimized demand timing for 2019. This charging strategy, however, increases the depletion of material resources by 72% compared to an optimal reference charging profile. The results for the future energy generation scenarios show that deviation between environmental impact categories can deviate and differences increase over the investigated time horizon. Nevertheless, by analyzing the differences between all impact category pairs, we found six categories, including climate change, within which differences are found to be less than 10%.

AB  - Trade has remained a pivotal ingredient to the economic prosperity of many resources rich Sub-Sahara African (SSA) states over the years. However, an examination of the environmental aspects of trading activities amidst vast natural resources is critical to positioning Sub-Sahara African states on environmental sustainability path in their quest for economic prosperity. Unlike most extant studies that only focused on fossil energy facets of energy consumption, this study provides a synthesis of the impacts of trade and natural resources on renewable energy consumption in a bid to address environmental sustainability challenges in the SSA region. The empirical dissection hinges on the ARDL approach for available renewable energy consumption data while incorporating other relevant factors like the SSA's income level, FDI, and urbanization trends among the countries. From the results, the duo of openness to trade and urbanization posits significant detrimental impacts on the level of renewable energy consumption in the SSA region, while the impacts created by resources rent on renewable energy consumption level were insignificant. Conversely, a rise in income level alongside higher FDI was observed to be leading to a significant positive effect on renewable energy utilization with estimated long-run elasticity of -0.126 and -0.105 respectively. This implies that poverty reduction and foreign capital inflow can significantly boost the adoption and use of renewables in the SSA. As such, policy frameworks to harness essential FDI inflow for environmental benefits in view of clean energy consumption amidst vast resources were highlighted for the SSA authorities, while also emphasizing the need to guide against potential regional pollution haven tendencies.

AB  - Global warming has recently become a significant concern for world leaders. Financial efficiency, environmental regulations, and green technologies are widely recognized as important contributors to a clean environment. Consequently, the primary motive of this study is to investigate the impact of financial efficiency, environmental regulations, and green technologies on CO2 emissions and energy efficiency in top polluted economies over the period 1995 to 2020. To that end, the study relies on the ARDL-PMG model, which can provide both short- and long-run estimates simultaneously. The findings of the model imply that environmental innovation and regulations helps improve energy efficiency and environmental quality in the long run. In contrast, financial development deteriorates the environmental quality and improves energy efficiency. Therefore, policy experts in top polluted economies must increase research and development activities to promote green technologies and introduce strict environmental-related regulations to complement other mitigating policies.

AB  - The recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) includes a number of incentive-based programs (e.g., tax credits) designed to motivate firms to develop new clean technologies for fighting climate change. However, the IRA also includes a fee firms incur for excessive methane emissions. This represents the first time the United States government has ever levied a fee on greenhouse gas emissions, and it raises an interesting research question-how should a budget-constrained regulator balance the use of both incentive and penalty-based levers for stimulating investment in clean technology development? In this paper, we examine a regulator's optimal penalty and subsidy decisions for motivating firms to invest in clean technology development. We illustrate how the level of competitive intensity in the market can influence a budget-constrained regulator with multiple competing objectives-the environment, firm profits, and consumer welfare. We find that a subsidy is always beneficial, irrespective of the regulator's objective. While imposing a firm penalty always benefits the environment, it always negatively impacts the sum of firm profits and consumer welfare. However, depending on the level of competition in the market, instances can occur where imposing a high penalty actually benefits total firm profits or consumer welfare (separately). Interestingly, a regulator that cares about all three dimensions of its objective equally, should always set the penalty to either its minimum or maximum value, depending on whether the environmental cost of the harmful product is high or low.

AB  - This study contributes to the environment-growth nexus literature by examining corruption's effect on envi-ronmental quality in 17 Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries between 1984 and 2018. We use four different indicators of environmental degradation (ecological footprint, carbon dioxide emissions, greenhouse gas emissions, and carbon emission intensity) to gain a comprehensive view of the relationship. This study's methodological value added is the application of the method of moments quantile regression, which enables us to account for different relationships between the independent variables and environmental quality at different levels of environmental degradation. The results indicate that corruption worsens environmental quality based on three of the four indicators of environmental degradation, while the impact appears to become less severe at higher levels of environmental deterioration. The results also indicate that traditional mean-based panel data estimation methods provide an incomplete picture of the factors behind environmental problems: The explan-atory variables' impacts tend to vary at different levels of environmental quality, and the impact's sign can even change when moving from the lowest to the highest environmental degradation quantiles. Overall, the results highlight the importance of curbing corruption to enable enforcement of more stringent environmental regulations.

AB  - There are many good reasons to promote sustainable development and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other combustion emissions. The air quality in many urban environments is causing many premature deaths because of asthma, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and dementia associated with combustion emissions. The global social cost of air pollution is at least $3 trillion/year; particulates, nitrogen oxides and ozone associated with combustion emissions are very costly pollutants. Better air quality in urban environments is one of the reasons for countries to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. There are many potential benefits associated with limiting climate change. In the recent past, the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have been increasing and the number of weather and climate disasters with costs over $1 billion has been increasing. The average global temperature set new record highs in 2014, 2015, and 2016. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the transition to electric vehicles and electricity generation using renewable energy must take place in accord with the goals of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. This work reviews progress and identifies some of the health benefits associated with reducing combustion emissions.

AB  - Greenhouse gas emissions from power plants that use fossil fuels cause a serious impact to the environment, for this reason the use of renewable energy technologies is an important alternative as a way of combatting climate change. The production of power via biomass is considered as a carbon neutral energy resource, but it is well known that the non-fossil CO2 emitted from this type of processes can also be captured. In order to do so, in this work it is proposed a match between a Biogas combined cycle power plant and postcombustion carbon capture process, to capture the CO2 produced by the biogas combustion, and also it considered a match with an organic Rankine cycle that uses the wasted energy of the combustion gases. Additionally, it is considered that the captured carbon is used to produce some value-added chemicals and fuels. Environmental and energetic evaluations were carried out for the coupling of those technologies. The implementation of the carbon capture plant, results on a diminution of the 87% of the emission of the combined cycle power plant. The life cycle analysis results show that the study case of Syngas production via dry reforming of methane, presents the lower global warming potential (0.088 CO2-eq kg/kg) and it was also found that the global warming potential has a reduction with the help of the mass integration between the different alternatives of CO2 utilization. Finally, it was found an annual reduction of 0.055 CO2-eq t for the system with mass integration compared with the cases without mass integration.

AB  - The history of film sound has usually been configured as a series of technological upheavals. In every case, the story has been told through technological innovations, as if changes in technology were alone responsible for the development of new sound strategies. The approach offered here differs markedly from these previous treatments of sound. Instead of concentrating on technological shifts, this article stresses technical decisions made by the soundmen and directors responsible for developing Hollywood's standard approach to sound. Through succinct analysis of two key films, The First Auto (Warner, 1927) and It Happened One Night (Columbia, 1934), along with briefer treatment of The Big Trail (Fox, 1930), a distinction is made between "shot-by-shot" treatment of sound and "scene-by-scene" treatment of sound. The systematic use of sound in It Happened One Night to establish and maintain a coherent sense of place gives rise to recognition of the increasingly common use of what the article terms "establishing sound." Parallel to Hollywood's familiar technique of introducing each scene with an "establishing shot," the use of establishing sound offers filmmakers an additional method of locating auditors and maintaining their relationship to the film.

AB  - Both UK and Germany have committed to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and tackling climate change. In the past decade, a surge of residential solar and storage applications has been accelerated by subsidies, cost reduction of the system and increasing energy prices. Many advantages of community energy storage have been identified and its applications have been widely investigated. However, its profitability is still questionable, and more work is needed to improve its accessibility. Here we compare and contrast community energy storage using lithium-ion batteries in the UK and Germany - two countries with different solar profiles and different electricity tariffs. Results indicate that the primary impacting factor on self-sufficiency is the solar generation, meaning that communities in Germany can be up to 30% more self-sufficient than their UK counterparts. Additionally, the profitability of households in Germany is also higher (achieving a simple payback time of less than 10 years) due to the subsidies for storage and on-site generation. The results highlight the importance of using a location-specific approach for system planning. For example, households in Germany should aim to fully exploit on-site generation, whilst UK households should improve generation output, for example by using a hybrid PV plus wind turbine system. In addition, more financial and regulatory support is needed in the UK to improve project feasibility.

AB  - Estimating the carbon sequestration potential of Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens) forests and optimizing management strategies play pivotal roles in enhancing quality and promoting sustainable development. However, there is a lack of methods to simulate changes in carbon sequestration capacity in Moso bamboo forests and to screen and optimize the best management measures based on long-term time series data from fixed-sample fine surveys. Therefore, this study utilized continuous survey data and climate data from fixed sample plots in Zhejiang Province spanning from 2004 to 2019. By comparing four different algorithms, namely random forest, support vector machine, XGBoost, and BP neural network, to construct aboveground carbon stock models for Moso bamboo forests. The ultimate goal was to identify the optimal algorithmic model. Additionally, the key driving parameters for future carbon stocks were considered and future aboveground carbon stocks were predicted in Moso bamboo forests. Then formulated an optimal management strategy based on these predictions. The results indicated that the carbon stock model constructed using the XGBoost algorithm, with an R-2 of 0.9895 and root mean square error of 0.1059, achieved the best performance and was considered the optimal algorithmic model. The most influential driving parameters for vegetation carbon stocks in Moso bamboo forests were found to be mean age, mean diameter at breast height, and mean culm density. Under optimal management measures, which involve no harvesting of 1-3 du bamboo, 30% harvesting of 4 du bamboo, and 80% harvesting of bamboo aged 5 du and above. Our predictions show that aboveground carbon stocks in Moso bamboo forests in Zhejiang Province will peak at 36.25 +/- 8.47 Tg C in 2046 and remain stable from 2046 to 2060. Conversely, degradation is detrimental to the long-term maintenance of carbon sequestration capacity in Moso bamboo forests, resulting in a peak aboveground carbon stock of 29.50 +/- 7.49 Tg C in 2033, followed by a continuous decline. This study underscores the significant influence of estimating carbon sequestration potential and optimizing management decisions on enhancing and sustaining the carbon sequestration capacity of Moso bamboo forests.

AB  - Soil turnover by tree uprooting in primary and secondary forests on the island of Puerto Rico was measured in 42 study plots in the months immediately after the passage of a Category 3 hurricane. Trunk basal area explained 61% of the variability of mound volume and 53% of the variability of mound area. The proportion Of uprooted trees, the number of uprooted trees, or the proportion of uprooted basal area explained 84-85% of the variation in hurricane-created mound area. These same variables explain 79-85% of the variation in mound volume. The study indicates that the soil turnover period from tree uprooting by Puerto Rican hurricanes is between 1600 and 4800 years. These rates are faster than soil turnover by landslides and background treefall in the same area and provide a useful age constraint on soil profile development and soil carbon sequestration in these dynamic landscapes.

AB  - The three recent Special Reports of the IPCC provide an opportunity to understand overarching climate risk, as they cover a wide diversity of risks to natural and human systems. Here we develop a scoring system to translate qualitative IPCC risk assessments into risk scores that, when aggregated, describe global risk from climate change. By the end of this century, global climate risk will increase substantially with greenhouse gas emissions compared to today (composite risk score increase of two- and fourfold under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively). Comparison of risk levels under +1.5 degrees C and +2 degrees C suggests that every additional 0.5 degrees C of global warming will contribute to higher risk globally (by about a third). Societal adaptation has the potential to decrease global climate risk substantially (by about half) under all RCPs, but cannot fully prevent residual risks from increasing (by one-third under RCP2.6 and doubling under RCP8.5, compared to today). Different frameworks, most notably expert assessments from the IPCC, have been developed to determine risk from climate change over this century. Estimated risk scores quantified from the IPCC assessments show a substantial increase in global composite risk by 2100 for low and high emissions.

AB  - Bangladesh is well on course to become one of the leading emerging market economies in the world. Hence, it can be expected that the economic growth of Bangladesh would substantially increase over the next decade. This, in turn, is likely to boost the energy consumption levels of the nation whereby meeting the surge in the energy demand would be a crucial agenda of the government. Therefore, it is important to understand the factors that influence the nation's energy demand. Against this backdrop, this paper aims to evaluate the macroeconomic determinants of total, renewable, and non-renewable energy demands in Bangladesh between 1980 and 2014. Besides, the analysis is conducted for both primary energy and electricity consumption levels. The econometric methods used in this study controlled for the structural break issues in the data. The key findings, in a nutshell, show that economic growth and household consumption expenditure positively influence the overall primary energy and electricity demands in Bangladesh while income inequality exerts opposite effects. Besides, technological innovations are found to be reducing the total and non-renewable energy demand in Bangladesh while increasing the demand for renewable energy. On the other hand, positive oil price shocks are found to be ineffective in influencing the renewable energy demand but slightly reducing the non-renewable energy demand. Finally, the causality estimates portray the feedback hypothesis in almost all the cases to highlight the inter-relationships between economic growth and energy demand in Bangladesh. Hence, in line with these findings several critically important policy implications are suggested for managing the overall energy demand in Bangladesh.

AB  - Around 50% of the wood harvested annually in Spain for industrial purposes is produced in the north-western region of Galicia. In this study, species-specific equations were developed for estimating dry harvest residues (kg) from stem volume (m3) in the fast-growing Pinus pinaster Ait., Pinus radiata D. Don and Eucalyptus spp., which generate around 95% of harvested wood. The presence of heteroscedasticity was taken into account in model fitting. Regional dry harvest residues were estimated using the equations and regional harvested volume records (m3), by assuming a mean harvested tree of diameter at breast height of 45 cm for pines and 25 cm for eucalyptus. A moisture content (M) of 25% was assumed for direct combustion of harvest residues; therefore, wet values were calculated from dry estimates, and a lower heating value (M = 25%) was used. The bioenergy potentially produced from the estimated harvest residues (M = 25%) was 377 ktoe year-1 in the period 2018?2019, equivalent to 4.7% of the total primary energy consumption in Galicia in 2018. Currently 70% of potential bioenergy production is concentrated in a sub-region representing 40% of the whole region. The approach used provides a direct link between regional or local harvested volume (registered or simulated) and accurate estimation of potential bioenergy from direct combustion of harvest residues, thus supporting decisionmaking related to climate change targets and to decreasing dependence on fossil fuels. However, further research that takes into account environmental, economical and social constraints in removing harvest residues is required.

AB  - The Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) represent the world's first effort toward the Paris Agreement goal of keeping global temperature increase well below 2 degrees C and pursuing 1.5 degrees C. Little is known about how much the proposed mitigation efforts can reduce the risks and economic damages from unabated climate change and about the consequences if key emitters drop the Paris Agreement. Here, we use CLIMRISK, an integrated assessment model designed to support climate policy at the global, national, and subnational scales where mitigation and adaptation policy decisions are made. We characterize the consequences of unabated climate change and the benefits of current climate policy proposals by means of probabilistic estimates of the economic damages of climate change and uni- and multivariate dynamic climate risk indices at a detailed spatial resolution. The results presented reveal that the economic costs and risks are highly unequally distributed between and within countries and larger than previously estimated when warming in urban areas and temporal persistence of impacts are accounted for. Costs and risks can be significantly limited by strict implementation of NDCs, but increase noticeably under noncompliance by large emitters, like the United States.

AB  - Progress toward the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is insufficient at a global scale. A thorough and interdisciplinary understanding of barriers and levers to sustainability, including synergies and trade-offs between SDGs, is utterly important but still limited. Ethnobiology is often advocated as a key discipline to address this research gap. We conducted a systematic literature review to explore (i) the visibility of ethnobiology within sustainability science, (ii) how ethnobiology understands the notion of sustainability, (iii) if ethnobiology literature on sustainability issues engages differently with nonacademic knowledge and people compared to other types of ethnobiology research, and (iv) which SDGs are addressed (explicitly or implicitly) by ethnobiology. Our study reveals a minimal overlap between sustainability science and ethnobiology literature. The articles reviewed never mention the SDGs explicitly, but often address them implicitly. Reviewed ethnobiological articles addressed themes of relevance to almost all SDGs, especially the linkages between SDGs 1-3 and 15, but always implicitly. Biodiversity's understanding (SDG 15) provides the basis for culture and Indigenous and local knowledge and ensures communities' food security (SDG 2), health and well-being (SDG 3), and prosperity (SDG 1). We found that ethnobiology does not examine sustainability through the lens of the global sustainability agenda, and that knowledge coproduction processes are rarely reported. While ethnobiology demonstrates its relevance to address SDGs and contribute to transformative change, this potential is not fully realized because of a persisting decoupling between place-based research and global sustainability frameworks.

AB  - The current climate emergency and the war in Ukraine have placed climate action and energy security at the top of the EU's agenda. The 'Fit for 55' legal package and REPowerEU Plan set out short- and medium -term measures to end EU dependence on Russian fossil fuels and address climate change. The new targets and policy instruments have the potential to accelerate decarbonization of the continent. However, from the perspective of the environment and social equity, serious concerns remain as to the sustainability of the transformation. For example, difficulties in achieving immediate independence from Russian fuels has led some EU countries to increase their use of coal. The accelerated roll -out of renewable energies has increased the demand for materials and land, sparking territorial conflicts and impacting biodiversity. Support from the Social Climate Fund will not meet all the demands of the most vulnerable sections of society for assistance with the costs derived from the energy transitions, such as cleaner heating systems and transport. This paper offers an overview of the EU's new measures to step up the energy transformation and assesses them through the lens of environmental sustainability and fair transition.

AB  - This article is a response to the global Beijing +25 call to take stock of the status of women and the assessment of current challenges to gender equality and women's empowerment. It presents a case study of the coordination capacity of government and civil society organisations in meeting the Beijing Platform for Action's strategic objectives in tackling gender-based violence (GBV) against women in Uganda through a multi-level coordinated and implemented programme. Drawing on established sectoral and district gender-mainstreaming policy and practices led by the women's ministry, the programme demonstrated what is possible in a collaborative partnership involving several stakeholders in prevention and response to GBV. The joint GBV programme created alliances that resulted in established services such as community guidelines for GBV prevention, legal services to support survivors, shelters for the temporary protection of women and children, and counselling services. Community groups that were created facilitated dialogues and initiated action on discussing power, inequality and behaviour change. In sum, the programme's high-level political commitment, technical and cultural leadership partially guaranteed the continuation of the GBV interventions and sustainability of the impacts. The major challenge was the enforcement of gender-sensitive public resources allocation that would engender planning and budgeting cultures. The renewed Beijing +25 bid for bold actions and commitments to end violence against women, needs to bolster support that beefs-up State-level concerns of inadequate technical skills, capabilities, and financial support to investigate cases of GBV against women. It needs to multiply actions to finance State-level measures that seek fundamental gender norms change. The article draws on qualitative and quantitative data collection techniques. A survey of 620 households was combined with key informant interviews and focus group discussions.

AB  - The oxidation of ammonia by autotrophic bacteria is a central part of the nitrogen cycle and a fundamental aspect of biological nutrient removal (BNR) during wastewater treatment. Autotrophic ammonia oxidation produces protons and results in net-CO2 production due to the neutralizing effect of bicarbonate alkalinity. Attention must be paid to the propensity for this produced CO2 to be transferred to the atmosphere where it can act as a greenhouse gas (GHG). In the context of BNR systems, bicarbonate-derived CO2 emissions should be considered distinct from the biogenic CO2 that arises from cellular respiration, though this distinction is not made in current GHG accounting practices. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of two experimental systems operated under autotrophic mode and buffered with bicarbonate, to investigate the relationship between ammonia removal and gaseous CO2 emissions. The first system consisted of continuously aerated lab-scale batch reactors, which were effective in demonstrating the important link between ammonia oxidizer activity, pH, and gaseous CO2 production. Depletion of the buffer system always led to a rapid decline in system pH and cessation of CO2 emissions when the pH fell below 7.0. The second system was a tubular continuous-flow biofilm reactor which permitted comparison of ammonia removal and CO2 emission rates. A linear relationship between ammonia removal and CO2 emissions was demonstrated and the quantified CO2 production was relatively close to that which was predicted based on the stoichiometry of nitrification, with this CO2 being detected in the gas phase. It was apparent that this system offered minimal resistance to the mass transfer of CO2 from the liquid to gas, which is an important factor that determines how much of the bicarbonatederived CO2 may contribute to greenhouse gas emissions in engineered systems such as those used for BNR.

AB  - To align with climate initiatives, multiple reporting programs are transitioning from generic activity-based emission factors to site-specific measured emissions data to estimate greenhouse gas emissions at oil and gas facilities. This study contemporaneously deployed two top-down (TD) aerial methods across 14 midstream facilities, building upon previous research in the field. The methods produced multiple whole-facility estimates at each facility, resulting in 773 individual paired estimates (same facility, same day), and robust mean estimates for each facility. Mean estimates for each facility, aggregated across all facilities, differed by nearly 2:1 (49% [32% to 69%]). At 6 of 14 facilities, the methods produced mean estimates that differed by more than a factor of two. These data suggest that one or both methods did not produce accurate facility-level estimates at a majority of facilities and in aggregate across all facilities. The overall results are augmented with two case studies where TD estimates at two pre-selected facilities were coupled with comprehensive onsite measurements to understand the factors driving the divergence between TD and bottom-up (BU) emissions estimates. In 3 of 4 paired comparisons between the intensive onsite estimates and one of the TD methods, the intensive onsite surveys did not conclusively diagnose the difference in estimates. In these cases, our work suggests that the TD methods mis-estimate emissions an unknown fraction of the time, for unknown reasons. While two methods were selected for this study, it is unlikely that the issues identified here are confined to these two methods; similar issues may exist for other similar whole-facility methods on midstream and/or other facility types. These findings have important implications for the construction of voluntary and regulatory reporting programs that rely on emission estimates for reporting fees or penalties, or for studies using whole-facility estimates to aggregate TD emissions to basin or regional estimates.

AB  - Two freshwater and two marine microalgae species were grown under nitrogen replete and deplete conditions evaluating the impact on total biomass yield and biomolecular fractions (i.e. starch, protein, and lipid). A life cycle assessment was performed to evaluate varying species/growth conditions considering each biomass fraction and final product substitution based on energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), and eutrophication potential. Lipid for biodiesel was assumed as the primary product. Protein and carbohydrate fractions were processed as co-products. Composition of the non-lipid fraction presented significant trade-offs among biogas production, animal feed substitution, nutrient recycling, and carbon sequestration. Maximizing total lipid productivity rather than lipid content yielded the least GHG emissions. A marine, N-deplete case with relatively low lipid productivity but effective nutrient recycling had the lowest eutrophication impacts. Tailoring algal species/growth conditions to optimize the mix of biomolecular fractions matched to desired products and co-products can enable a sustainable integrated microalgal biorefinery.

AB  - The electrification of transport is a step towards the transition to efficient, cleaner, and low-carbon mobility, as it decreases negative environmental effects and greenhouse gas emissions. In many countries, the adoption and the deployment of electric vehicles was based on a combination of policy measures and incentives. To promote the uptake of electrification, it is important to understand consumers' opinions about electric vehicles. The aim of the present research is to investigate the factors influencing EV purchase decisions in a city of Greece. The analysis of this paper was based on the data collected using a structured questionnaire, addressed to the active population of Thessaloniki, the second largest city in Greece. A small percentage of the respondents own an electric vehicle. Appropriate statistical analysis identified correlations between the intention to purchase an electric vehicle and a number of critical factors.

AB  - African palm weevil (Rhynchophorus phoenicis) larvae are widely consumed in Ghana and most countries in Africa because of their high-quality protein and low greenhouse gas emissions than conventional livestock. However, the consumption of the larvae is hindered by the identification of viable agricultural by-products or artificial diets for production. To address this challenge, Rhynchophorus phoenicis was evaluated on three substrates, namely cassava, sugarcane, and palm yolk, to determine the fecundity and hatchability of eggs. Completely Randomized Design was used to assign substrates with four replications each. Overall, adults reared on palm yolk laid average of 76.2 eggs while the cassava and the sugarcane substrate recorded averages of 73.0 eggs and 63.3 eggs, respectively. This result exhibited a significant difference between the substrates. The egg hatchability of adults reared on cassava was comparable to those fed on a natural host (palm yolk). Cassava can be used as substitute for the production of adult African palm weevil.

AB  - The Thai domestic rare earth oxides, including cerium, lanthanum, and neodymium oxides, with the effects of calcination temperatures (500-1000 degrees C), were utilized as catalysts for twelve Jatropha biodiesel alternatives via an esterification reaction. This study applied life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology from well-to-wheel analysis to assess energy efficiency and the global warming impact with and without land use change. The results of the life cycle analysis showed that the Jatropha biodiesel alternatives using the La2O3 catalyst in all conditions (0.89-1.06) were found to be potential fuel substitutes for conventional diesel (0.86) in terms of net energy ratios; however, the results showed that they generated a higher global warming impact. Considering the improvement process of Jatropha biodiesel in the utilization of waste heat recovery, the Jatropha biodiesel reduced the impacts of the net energy ratios and the global warming impact by 22-24% and 34-36%, respectively. The alternative Jatropha biodiesel using the La2O3 catalyst with a calcination temperature of 600 degrees C was shown to be the most environmentally friendly of all the studied fuels; relatively, it had the highest energy ratios of 1.06-1.37 (with and without waste heat recovery) and the lowest total global warming impact of 47.9-70.7 kg CO2 equivalent (with land use change). The integration of the material and process development by domestic catalysts and the recovery of waste heat would improve the sustainability choices of biofuel production from renewable resources for transportation fuels in Thailand.

AB  - Oasis cities are central to the economic and social development as well as ecological sustainability in the arid region in Northwest China. This study aims to explore the balance between river health and human well-being of local residents in the Hexi River oasis, while also enhancing the effectiveness of water resource management within the basin. Utilizing the SMI-P method, we construct a 'Happy River' evaluation system that integrates goals, criteria, and indicators. We analyze the evaluation index system for 'Happy River' construction in the study area, specifically the Zhangye City section of the Heihe River Basin, and derive a comprehensive evaluation value for the 'Happy River' initiative. Additionally, we assess the fit attribute of the evaluation system using the coupled coordination degree model and harmony degree theory, thereby enhancing the rationality of the evaluation method and ensuring a more thorough examination process. The results indicate that from 2017 to 2021, the urban wastewater treatment rate and the degree of water quality excellence in the Zhangye City section of the Black River Basin represent the highest and lowest weights, respectively, within the evaluation system. This suggests that improving the quality of the urban water environment has emerged as the primary factor influencing the assessment of the Happy River during the construction of the Happy River and Happy Lake. Moreover, ecological health is identified as the most significant criterion in the evaluation system, serving as the main factor affecting residents' perceptions of happiness related to rivers and lakes. Over the five-year period, the happiness level in the study area improved from "relatively happy" to "very happy", while the coupling coordination degree increased from 0.605 to 0.687, indicating a gradual progression toward coordinated development. Simultaneously, the harmony degree rose from 0.527 to 0.601, suggesting a tendency towards a condition of basic harmony. Additionally, the happiness index increased from 76.71 to 81.97, transitioning from a state of happiness to one of very high happiness. The composite index also improved, rising from 0.459 to 0.526, which demonstrates the preliminary success of the 'Happy River' construction efforts in the study area. The evaluation system and model of the 'Happy River', along with the final results of this study, can serve as theoretical references for the development of similar initiatives in typical characteristic rivers within the arid region of Northwest China.

AB  - In the context of global climate change, it is critical to study how different forest management practices affect forest carbon sequestration. This is especially important for forest managers and policy makers who will have to design and implement appropriate mitigation and adaptation strategies. Previous research has focused on coniferous plantations with rare examination of plantations of evergreen broad-leaved species. Phoebe bournei (Hemsley) Yang, as one of the representative species of subtropical evergreen broadleaf forests in Asia, has a unique potential to increase forest carbon sink. In this study, field data were combined with the forest ecosystem management model FORECAST to estimate the impacts of different forest management strategies (combinations of planting densities from 1000 to 4000 trees ha(-1), rotation lengths from 20 to 80 years, and different harvesting intensities: stem-only, whole-tree and complete-tree) on carbon sequestration of P. bournei plantations in south-eastern China. Field and previously published data were used to calibrate the model for stand biomass pools accumulation, stand density and mortality, light response curves, photosynthetic efficiency, and data on soil nutrient pools, for three different site conditions. The results showed that the most suitable planting density to maximize carbon sequestration in P. bournei plantations is 2000-3000 trees ha(-1). Longer rotations (e.g., 80 years) are better than shorter rotations (20 or 30 years) for the long-term maintenance of site productivity, though the recommended rotation length for maximizing carbon sequestration and maintaining forest productivity is 40-60 years. As for harvesting intensity, stem-only harvesting is the most suitable strategy to manage for carbon sequestration when maintaining long-term site productivity, with whole-tree and complete-tree harvesting constituting less optimal options. Our modeling exercise indicates that P. bournei plantations have great potential for carbon sequestration if they are managed under sustainable and ecologically-based strategies. Given that forests are important in the global carbon cycle, it is recommended that afforestation efforts in relevant subtropical regions use appropriate broad-leaved species that can help resolve ecological and socio-economic challenges.

AB  - Fire blight is a severe bacterial plant disease that affects important chain-of-value fruit trees such as pear and apple trees. This disease is caused by Erwinia amylovora, a quarantine phytopathogenic bacterium, which, although highly distributed worldwide, still lacks efficient control measures. The green revolution paradigm demands sustainable agriculture practices, for which antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have recently caught much attention. The goal of this work was to disclose the bioactivity of three peptides mixtures (BP100:RW-BP100, BP100:CA-M, and RW-BP100:CA-M), against three strains of E. amylovora representing distinct genotypes and virulence (LMG 2024, Ea 630 and Ea 680). The three AMPs' mixtures were assayed at eight different equimolar concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 6 mu M (1:1). Results showed MIC and MBC values between 2.5 and 4 mu M for every AMP mixture and strain. Regarding cell viability, flow cytometry and alamarBlue reduction, showed high reduction (>25%) of viable cells after 30 min of AMP exposure, depending on the peptide mixture and strain assayed. Hypersensitive response in tobacco plants showed that the most efficient AMPs mixtures and concentrations caused low to no reaction of the plant. Altogether, the AMPs mixtures studied are better treatment solutions to control fire blight disease than the same AMPs applied individually.

AB  - Increasing greenhouse gas emissions due to an uncontrolled increase in fuel consumption has become a worldwide challenge during the last decades. Meanwhile, replacing green energy with traditional fuel energy is always a solution to this problem. However, the transition between these two energy resources is a little timeconsuming because of changing the infrastructures. Nanotechnology provides promising solutions for different problems in different fields, including the fuel industry. Various studies show the improvement of the toxic and greenhouse emissions by adding nanoparticles into the pure fuel. The nanoparticles change the thermophysical properties of the pure flue. Subsequently, it changes the evaporation behavior of the sprayed droplet in the combustion chamber, leading to faster ignition and enhancing the burning rate. The present review focused on the effect of additive nanoparticles on the evaporation behavior of fuel droplets and its underlying mechanism. The impact of different parameters, including the nanoparticle type, concentration, size, the ambient temperature, on the evaporation characteristics is presented.

AB  - Ecological restoration, green space morphology, and carbon emissions are intricately interconnected. Previous research utilizing case studies and econometric modeling has demonstrated that effective ecological restoration and well-structured green space configurations can significantly enhance carbon sequestration, reduce carbon emissions, and mitigate the adverse effects of climate change during urbanization. However, as urban land-use patterns become increasingly complex and development trajectories more diverse, the relationship between green space morphology and carbon dynamics (emissions and sequestration) reveals notable heterogeneity and non-linear characteristics. Understanding these complex, non-linear relationships and the underlying mechanisms is both theoretically and technically innovative, with profound implications for urban planning, policy formulation, climate change mitigation, and ecological conservation. In this study, we applied machine learning algorithms to model the non-linear relationships and threshold effects between green space evolution and carbon emissions/sequestration at different stages of ecological restoration in the Yangtze River Basin, China. Furthermore, we simulated the low-carbon performance of green spaces under various urban development scenarios. The key findings include: (1) Wetlands, particularly those composed of shallow water bodies and land-water interfaces such as marshes and mangroves, are critical determinants of the low-carbon performance of green spaces, with their effects on carbon emissions and sequestration exhibiting significant temporal dynamics throughout different stages of ecological restoration. (2) The fragmentation and shape complexity of green spaces substantially influence carbon efficiency. Preserving the connectivity and integrity of green spaces, particularly in large-scale forests and wetlands, while minimizing fragmentation and reducing shape complexity, can enhance carbon sequestration capacity. (3) Carbon performance varies markedly across different urban development trajectories. In cities prioritizing ecological restoration, future carbon emissions tend to stabilize, whereas in rapidly growing megacities, despite recent declines in carbon emissions, further optimization of green space configurations is required to effectively manage emissions and bolster sequestration. In summary, this study provides robust scientific evidence for ecological restoration and green space planning in the Yangtze River Basin, offering valuable insights for carbon management and ecological restoration in similar regions globally. These findings contribute to global environmental governance efforts and the ongoing fight against climate change.

AB  - Public service fleets offer an attractive option for introducing new renewable fuels on a large scale, which allow for the reduction of both greenhouse gas emissions and exhaust air pollutants. This study examines the use of biomethane (bio-CNG) and compressed natural gas for part of the bus fleet in Dublin, Ireland. The emissions produced from the 2008 fleet based at one of the city's seven bus depots are compared to use of new diesel and bio-CNG buses. The optimum feedstock for bio-CNG production in Ireland was then investigated, as well as the quantity of feedstock needed to produce the required bio-CNG to fuel the bus fleet examined. As expected the results showed a substantial decrease in all exhaust emissions from the use of bio-CNG buses compared the 2008 fleet. Grass silage was chosen as the optimum feedstock for production of bio-CNG in Ireland. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Aguas frescas are Mexican drinks that are typically made with water, sugar, and fruit. Aguas frescas may be a significant fi cant component of sugary-drink intake among Mexican and Mexican-American (MA) adults. However, it is unclear whether survey respondents report aguas frescas consumption when it is not specifically fi cally queried in standardized beverage frequency instruments. Objectives: This study examined the prevalence of aguas frescas consumption, the sociodemographic correlates of aguas frescas intake, and how specifically fi cally querying aguas frescas intake affects sugary-drink estimates among Mexican and MA adults. Methods: Cross-sectional, online surveys were conducted in 2021 with 5377 Mexican and 3073 MA adults as part of the International Food Policy Study. Past 7-d consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), sugary drinks, and aguas frescas were assessed along with relevant covariates. Weighted analyses included logistic and linear regression, including models with correlation structure. Results: An estimated 61.7% of Mexican and 28.7% of MA adults consumed aguas frescas. . In Mexico, consumption was associated with females, low education, perceiving oneself as having about the right weight, being good to excellent health, and consuming an unhealthy amount of sugary drinks. For MAs, intake was associated with being younger, speaking Spanish, and perceiving oneself as being underweight or about the right weight. Among Mexican adults who consumed aguas frescas but did not report them unless specifically fi cally queried, the volume of SSB intake was 67.9% higher for females and 64.3% higher for males when aguas frescas were included. Among MAs, SSB intake was 56.9% higher for females and 44.1% higher for males. Most participants (79.9%-85.2%) - 85.2%) remained in the same sugary-drink tertiles when including compared with excluding aguas frescas. . Conclusions: Aguas frescas should be queried during beverage intake assessments, as they contribute a nontrivial amount of added sugars to the diets of many Mexican and MA adults.

AB  - Users' non-sustainable consumption behaviors are affecting the sustainability of access-based services (ABSs), but ABS firms can utilize messaging strategies (ex-ante reminders) to persuade users to curtail their non-sustainable consumption behaviors. Through two online scenario-based experiments in China, this study determined that: (1) Compared with rational appeal messaging, emotional appeal messaging is better able to persuade consumers to curtail non-sustainable consumption behaviors. Furthermore, loss-framed messages are more effective than gain-framed ones. (2) Message appeal and message framing have an interactive persuasive effect on reducing such consumer behaviors. Loss-framed rational appeal messages are more persuasive at reducing non-sustainable consumption behaviors than gain-framed rational appeal messages, and gain-framed emotional appeal messages persuade consumers to reduce non-sustainable consumption behaviors more than loss-framed ones. (3) Consumers' psychological ownership moderates the persuasive effect of messaging. Among consumers with a high level of psychological ownership of shared goods, only gain-framed emotional appeal messaging is effective at reducing non-sustainable consumption behaviors, whereas among consumers with low psychological ownership, the persuasive effect of loss-framed rational appeal messaging is more effective than gain-framed emotional appeal messaging. This study extends the research on non-sustainable consumption behavior management in ABSs and provides important inspiration for the management of ABSs consumer behavior.

AB  - Bioenergy systems are expected to expand over the coming decades due to their potential to address energy security and environmental pollution challenges. Nevertheless, any renewable energy project can only survive if approved environmentally superior to its conventional counterparts. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is an internationally standardized and validated methodology to evaluate and quantify the environmental impacts of bioenergy systems. However, due to its methodological scope, the LCA method measures only the environmental consequences of the target products of energy systems. The LCA approach can neither allocate the environmental impacts at the component level nor measure the environmental impacts of intermediate products. These challenges can be substantially resolved by systematically integrating the LCA approach with the thermodynamically-rooted exergy, offering a powerful environmental sustainability assessment tool known as "exergoenvironmental analysis". Due to the unique methodological and conceptual characteristics of exergoenvironmental analysis in revealing the possibilities and trends for improvement, it has recently received increasing attention to mitigate the environmental impacts of bioenergy systems. Therefore, this review is aimed to thoroughly summarize and critically discuss the evaluation of sustainability aspects of bioenergy systems based on exergoenvironmental analysis. The pros and cons of using exergoenvironmental analysis in bioenergy research are also outlined to identify possible future directions for the field. Overall, exergoenvironmental analysis can offer more detailed information on the environmental consequences of each flow and component of bioenergy production plants, thereby diagnosing the breakthrough points for additional environmental improvements.

AB  - The long tradition of catchment studies in hydrology results from the need to understand the water balance operating in basins, the processes controlling water movements and the impacts of land-use change on water quantity and quality. The interactions between physical, chemical and biological behaviour have become an increasingly dominant theme in recent years, and this has been boosted by global environmental problems such as acid rain and climatic change. After a historical summary of catchment studies, a brief review is given of some of the most influential experiments and their underlying objectives and results, concentrating on those concerned with one land-use change in particular - to/from forestry. In interpreting the effects of a change in forest cover, it is necessary also to consider impacts of the associated site disturbance, including possible soil compaction and road construction as a result of logging and any artificial drainage before tree planting. The recent tendency to link basin studies into networks is discussed, with examples of currently active networks.

AB  - With the growing concerns of energy sustainability, greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change, there is an increasing interest in understanding vehicle ownership and utilization decisions better so that effective policies can be implemented to reduce the negative impacts of private automobile usage. Although there is a rich body of literature on the long-term decisions of vehicle ownership and the composition of vehicles, the short-term choices of which vehicle to use from the household's vehicle holdings and what distance will be traveled to access opportunities, as well as the interrelationship between the two, are less understood. The purpose of this study was to contribute to the literature on short-term vehicle utilization decisions with the use of data collected in 2009 from the National Household Travel Survey. A latent class segmentation model was estimated with alternate interrelationship structures as the latent classes. Within each latent class, the choices were modeled consistently with the interrelationship structure through the introduction of the first choice as an explanatory variable in the model of the second choice. Additionally, scale was introduced to account for differences in the choices and interrelationships across regions. Most of the model estimation results were behaviorally plausible and consistent with expectations. A significant finding was that interrelationships in both latent classes were insignificant. It was also found that the latent model, even with the insignificant interrelationships, outperformed the alternate model formulations in terms of model fit. This finding shows that the latent segments may capture unobserved heterogeneity beyond the interrelationships.

AB  - Stakeholder perception and supply-demand relations are the main challenges and future directions for research on ecosystem services (ES). Based on spatial data and statistical data, we mapped eight key ES supply between 2005-2015 in the Huailai mountain-basin area. Using data from 507 survey questionnaires, we identified the ES demand and the public perceptions of the changes in ES. In addition, we also reveal the characteristics of the spatial distribution of ES demand, analyze the spatial supply-demand matching of ES, and explore the relationships between ES supply-demand and human well-being. From 2005 to 2015, a general upward trend was observed in the supply of four types of product provisioning services, which is different from the trend perceived by the stakeholders. An increasing trend was observed for carbon sequestration and forest recreation, which was in line with the perceptions of change. A spatial mismatch existed between the ES demand and supply, whereby the supply of carbon sequestration, soil conservation, habitat quality, and forest recreation services exceeded the demand in townships in the mountainous and hilly regions. On the other hand, townships located in the valley plains experienced a high imbalance between the demand and the supply. For the four types of product provisioning services, most towns and villages showed a balance in demand and supply. Linking ES supply-demand and human well-being showed that a threshold may exist in the supply-demand imbalance of regulating and supporting services before it begins to impact human well-being. Our study would enrich the theory and methodology research on relationships between ecosystem services and human well-being, and support knowledge to land allocation and management.

AB  - Diffusion of innovations is a theory that revolves around the process of introducing technological innovations into a system through the many available different channels of communication. The purpose of this paper is to undertake a systematic review of the literature available for this theory to gain an insight into the spread of the attributes that regulate the diffusion process of an innovation in question. ISI Web of Knowledge (R) and Google Scholar were the two search engines deployed for extracting the data relevant to this review. These engines fetched 2,073 publications in total that had cited the Rogers' Diffusion of Innovation theory. At the completion of the screening process only 223 publications were shortlisted as relevant. The analysis of these publications will be mainly carried out across the demographic features. These features have been typically categorised into seven demographic trends - frequency, year of publication, journals, conferences, authors, country, and number of citations. A cross sector analysis will be carried out to essentially place discussions over the sector specific innovations. These will then depict the informative trends emerging from these features which will be highlighted as the findings, along with the presentation of limitations and suggestions from this review.

AB  - Cities are key to global greenhouse gas emissions management. To explore urban greenhouse gas peak pathways, a city-level Energy Consumption and Greenhouse Gas Emission Analysis model was developed by using Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning model framework. Using the city of Guangzhou as a case study, this research compiled a overall energy balance sheet of base year and simulated future CO2 emission trends from 2015 to 2030 under three scenarios. Results show that CO2 emissions in Guangzhou will peak around 2023 under the current policy scenario. In order to advance the CO2 emissions peak to 2020, the more stringent emissions-reduction policies and measures need to be adopted under the peaking scenario and enhanced peaking scenario, with the peak emission value of 125-127 Mt CO(2)e. The industrial sector is the only sector in which CO2 emissions have peaked in Guangzhou, the building sector's CO2 emissions will not peak by 2030 under any of the three scenarios, while the transportation sector, which will contribute 50 percent of emission reduction potential, is the key to achieve its goal of peaking CO2 emissions on time. In the short term, stringent reduction strategies on the transportation, industrial, and power sectors are needed, including transport mode adjustment, industrial structure adjustment, electrification level improvement, clean-up transformation of thermal power, and energy efficiency improvement. However, in the long term, reduction strategies for the building sector, like energy efficiency improvement and large-scale application of renewable energy, will be essential for Guangzhou.

AB  - In many European countries with plentiful forest resources, novel forest-based businesses play a key role in the transition from our current fossil-based economy towards a circular bioeconomy. For example, kraft lignin, a by-product from the pulping industry, is produced in large amounts globally. To date, however, it is still only offered on the market by a small number of pulping companies. The successful innovation diffusion of related new technologies and businesses requires establishing a collective effort among multiple societal actors to motivate the sharing of value creation processes. In this paper, potential innovation diffusion pathways are modeled and simulated by means of an agent-based approach (Biorefinery Products Innovation Diffusion model, BioPID). The paper investigates the conditions needed to encourage the diffusion of kraft lignin innovations as a (partial) replacement for fossil-based feedstock in selected applications. The results reveal the basic mechanisms behind potential innovation diffusion pathways. The major barriers were found to be the high level of uncertainty surrounding the additional costs arising in lignin processing, the small number of lignin providers, and the presence of relatively homogeneous pricing strategies based on opportunity and basic preparation costs. The analysis of two product categories revealed different patterns in terms of innovation diffusion and potential greenhouse gas emissions. A novelty of BioPID is that it allows for iterative technology evaluation and technology foresight analysis of biorefinery projects (e.g., by combining techno-economic, socio-technical, and environmental aspects). This produces knowledge for diverse stakeholders involved in the lignin innovation ecosystem, thus enabling better communication on shared values and furthering innovation diffusion.

AB  - Green finance, innovation, and resource efficiency have gained significant traction recently, particularly in resource-rich countries. This study investigates the role of green finance and innovation in resource efficiency with the mediating lens of environmental regulations and market rules. The study employs a structural equation model on a panel of 15 resource-rich countries from 1995 to 2023. The findings illustrate a complicated interplay between the variables. First, the findings show that green financing positively and negatively affects resource efficiency. In contrast, green innovation constantly improves resource efficiency. Market rules have a favorable impact on resource efficiency. Environmental laws, however, hurt resource efficiency. Furthermore, the study reveals that green financing favors market regulations, implying that financial expenditures in green initiatives might strengthen regulatory frameworks that promote market efficiency. In contrast, green finance harms environmental rules, and green innovation harms both market and environmental regulations. In addition, we divided the sample into developed and developing nations and offered a sub-group analysis to take into consideration the variations in the degree of national development and green advances to further improve the analysis. Overall, the study emphasizes the multifaceted role of green finance and innovation in increasing resource efficiency within regulatory frameworks. These findings are critical for policymakers and stakeholders in resource-rich countries seeking to reconcile economic growth with sustainable development.

AB  - In this paper, we study the waste haven hypothesis, which predicts that waste materials will be exported from high-income developed countries with stringent environmental regulations to developing countries with less rigorous environmental protection. Using data on Japanese export of recyclable waste resources (plastic waste, waste paper, iron and steel scrap, and nonferrous metal scraps), we find evidence from our econometric analysis that Asian countries provide a waste haven for Japan. In particular, Japan exports waste materials to Asian countries with low per capita incomes and large markets. We suggest that environmental regulation should be tightened to reduce waste trade in Asia.

AB  - Arctic coastline ecosystems are affected by current sea level rise together with increasing anthropogenic and environmental physical and biogeochemical pressures. Changes in nutrient concentrations followed by changes in primary productivity and biodiversity are also connected with the growth of global trade, urbanization, and travel activity. All these anthropogenic activities create biotic homogenization. The occurrence of massive extensive mats of the yellow-green alga Vaucheria aff. compacta is a unique phenomenon in the High Arctic tidal flat ecosystem. The objective of this study was to outline which physicochemical conditions are connected with the massive presence of V. aff. compacta mats across the Adventfjorden tidal flat. The Adventfjorden tidal flat is a very dynamic system. Fine silt sediment (68% to 80%) dominates across the studied tidal flat. The sediment cover of V. aff. compacta mats was always very thin and felt-like coatings can grow out. Beneath the V. aff. compacta mats a second distinct layer of dead filaments were observed in the black and anoxic mud layer. V. aff. compacta area cover was positively correlated with water salinity, pH, temperature, and sediment Na and organic carbon content. In addition, potential abiotic factors related with the local distribution and abundance of V. aff. compacta showed positive correlations between area cover and N-nitrate and P-phosphate. N-nitrate concentration appears to significantly promote V. aff. compacta abundance. V. aff. compacta distribution and abundance in the Adventfjorden tidal flat is influenced by a wide spectrum of environmental and structural variables including anthropogenically induced micronutrients.

AB  - Gully erosion cause soil organic matter loss, which poses a grave threat to food security and regional ecological sustainability. Remote sensing monitoring and information extraction of gully erosion are of great significance to protect cultivated land resources and agricultural production. To improve the extraction accuracy of gully erosion, multi-level random forest (RF) extraction model based on object-based image analysis (OBIA) is proposed to extract gully erosion information. The Gaofen-2 (GF-2) image was selected as the main data source, supplemented by topographic data, to segment the features in Dehui City based on multi-scale segmentation method. Fusing spectral, textural and geometric feature information, the RF Gini index (GI) was used for feature optimization. Gully erosion extraction based on feature classes was performed using multi-level RF model based on OBIA in the southwestern part of Dehui City, with an overall accuracy (OA) of 96.71% and a Kappa coefficient (Kappa) of 0.865. Compared with the single-level extraction results, the OA and Kappa were improved by 8.4% and 0.102, which indicated that this model has better performance and has certain application value for the research of gully erosion information extraction and dynamic monitoring.

AB  - Financial support for environmental causes is more urgent than ever before. Thus, understanding consumer willingness to pay (WTP) for tourism is vital for policymakers, businesses, and researchers. This bibliometric study examined the trend of research on willingness to pay and tourism using 428 articles published in the Scopus indexed database between 1994 and 2023. The articles were extracted using the keywords "Willingness to pay tourism". A Microsoft Excel sheet was used in the descriptive analysis, and a VOSviewer version 1.6.20 was used for the citation and co-occurrence analysis. The study found that willingness to pay is a complex aspect of environmental economics and tourism behaviour that is shaped by various aspects. Amongst other things, willingness to pay is shaped by aspects such as tourist biogeography, amongst others is the level of environmental awareness, environmental sensitivity, and education. In many respects, it is shaped by demographic factors such as age, gender, income bracket, and area of origin. Even though the major thrust of willingness to pay was anchored on sustainability and environmental protection, recent events in the mold of climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, and technological innovation have played major roles in shaping tourists' behaviour. Given the emerging thrust and focus, there is a need to respond to geographic knowledge gaps in tourism hotspots to understand how this will shape tourism sustainability from a Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) perspective going forward. In doing so, it will be critical to ensure continued fostering and understanding of how tourists' willingness to pay for tourism destinations can lead to better design, marketing, and managed services to create memorable experiences that drive consumer loyalty.

AB  - Efficient and affordable adsorbents for CO2 capture are essential in implementing carbon capture technology to mitigate the negative impact of greenhouse gas emissions. This study focuses on synthesizing new nanoporous adsorbents from industrial waste slag using a simple and cost-effective coprecipitation method. In this method, raw slag was milled for 48 h and used as a benchmark for comparing two newly synthesized adsorbents. Selectivity and pure gas isotherm experiments were conducted for all adsorbents in the 25-65 degrees C temperature range and under harsh industrial conditions of 65 degrees C and 15 % CO2. This study utilized the response surface methodology (RSM) to optimize the CO2 adsorption parameters. Specifically, the optimized adsorption conditions were determined for the 15/85 % CO2/N-2 condition, and the optimal values for pressure and temperature were found to be 5 bar and 45 degrees C, resulting in CO2/N-2 selectivity of 5.65. The NH3-slag adsorbent was identified as the superior choice based on its selectivity and maximum adsorption capacity. The maximum adsorption capacity and cyclic efficiency were determined to be 4.15 mmol/g and 98.1 %, respectively, at a temperature, pressure, and composition of 45 degrees C, 5 bar, and 15 % CO2. Isotherm and thermodynamic models were employed to further investigate the adsorption process. The isotherm results indicated that the adsorption of CO2 by adsorbents occurred heterogeneously in patch-wise sites. Meanwhile, the thermodynamic parameters showed that the process was exothermic and spontaneous, with Delta H degrees falling below 20 (kJ/mol), showing physisorption phenomena.

AB  - This research work provides concise insights into fossil fuel consumption challenges, and the factors contributing to global warming, and evaluates the significance of photovoltaic (PV) materials in achieving net-zero-CO2 emissions. The article categorizes constraints in the development of PV cells into four main areas: technical factors, leadership impact, political instability, and financial aspects. Primarily, the study delves into technical factors, focusing on the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and power density of PV cells. Theoretically, approximately 67% of solar energy is dissipated in various forms:- 47% as heat, 18% as photons, and 2% in local combination loss. Commercially available mono-crystalline silicon (c-Si) and polycrystalline silicon (poly-c-Si) PV cells typically demonstrate a range of PCEs between 15%-22% and 13%18%, respectively, presenting an efficiency considerably lower than the potential maximum of 100%. The study highlights organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) as promising third-generation PV modules due to their relatively high power conversion efficiency (HPCE) and eco-friendly attributes. However, their commercial feasibility is under scrutiny owing to constraints such as a limited lifespan, high production costs, and challenges in mass production. Ongoing research and development (R&D) in PV cell technologies aim to enhance PCE and power density, establish cost-effective production methods, and create more reliable and sustainable supply chains. Additionally, the study explores the role of nanotechnology in developing high- power conversion efficiency cells, identifies research gaps and priorities in engineered organic material PV cells, and discusses the potential of OPVs in the R&D of high-efficiency, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly PV cells.

AB  - Considering that the core concerns in sustainability are threats to the survival of humankind and the ecosystems that humans depend on, changing the consumption and production behaviors of individuals and society is inevitable. However, people are reluctant to change their own behavior in support of sustainability goals. This tendency seems to be especially strong in tourism because the main value of tourism is hedonic utility. Thus, the tourism industry is now introducing gamification and smart tourism to shift tourist behavior toward sustainability, but most of studies and practices only focus on the performance and application of gamification without considering customer adoption patterns and perceptions during the process. This study empirically investigated what factors affect the adoption of smart tourism applications that incorporate game elements, using the Google Maps tourist guide program. As an initial approach, we incorporated diverse theoretical approaches: perceived usefulness; perceived ease of use; perceived enjoyment from technology acceptance model; information and interaction motivations from the uses and gratifications theory; the network effect; distributive justice; flow as responses to the game characteristics of smart tourism applications; and information privacy concerns as a negative factor for diffusion. The result showed that hedonic characteristics of the gamified smart tourism application (GSTA) are strong in adoption. Perceived enjoyment had a significant influence on the intention to use, but information quality, related to cognitive experience, did not. The flow and perceived distributive justice associated with the game content were not significant, but the interaction motivation was significant in the research model. The results of this study show that individuals regard a GSTA as a low-level game tool. Also, it is important to preoccupy the smart tourism application market in terms of marketing strategy because the network effect is relevant to both perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment. We also found that the need to provide personal information would negatively affect the adoption of a gamified smart tourism application.

AB  - The planet's social-ecological systems are expected to change in rapid and surprising ways in the coming decades, with consequences for ecosystems, ecosystem services, and human well-being. One way to support local communities and decision-makers at higher scales in addressing such surprising changes is to develop scenarios that are locally actionable and that can inform understanding of social-ecological dynamics across scales. This study focuses on three areas that require advances for developing globally relevant scenarios that support local action: (1) mobilizing Indigenous and local knowledge (ILK) in scenarios; (2) using scenarios to explore agency to affect the future; (3) probing a vast range of plausible positive futures. For scenarios to be relevant to communities in supporting positive change, approaches that engage with ILK to explore how human action, or agency, can shape the future are needed, as well as positive scenarios that feature a wide range of good outcomes for nature and people to inspire and guide action. We propose a novel set of methods for participatory scenario planningdeveloped and tested through a case study in the Canadian Arcticdesigned to carefully explore what positive futures' could mean to different populations faced with growing impacts from environmental and social change, and how positive outcomes can be achieved even in light of these changing dynamics. This scenario approach provides direction to engage multiple ways of knowing in developing knowledge about future changes that can direct sustainable action.

AB  - Previous studies have examined the local adoption of various development strategies primarily by surveying economic development practitioners, although the survey method suffers from subjectivity and recollection errors. To overcome these problems, I adopt a text mining method to canvass the comprehensive economic development strategies (CEDSs) across economic development districts (EDDs) in the United States. Twenty-eight main development strategies are identified, most of which belong to the "second wave," while the "fourth-wave" strategies-oriented toward social equity and sustainability-are popular enough to justify separation from the "third wave." Moreover, EDDs combine various waves of strategies to form their strategy portfolios. Two main types of portfolios have been identified-one is dominated by the second-wave strategies, while the other is more balanced across four waves and places a focus on both second- and fourth-wave strategies.

AB  - A bioenergy production and delivery system built around the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway (GLSLS) transportation corridor was assessed for its ability to mitigate energy security and climate change risks. The land area within 100 km of the GLSLS and associated railway lines was estimated to be capable of producing at least 30 Mt(dry)yr(-1) of lignocellulosic biomass with minimal adverse impacts on food and fibre production. This was estimated to be sufficient to displace all of the coal-fired electricity in Ontario plus more than 620 million L of green diesel (equivalent to 5.3% of diesel consumption in GLSLS provinces). Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions were 88% and 76% lower than coal-fired power and conventional diesel, respectively. Production costs of $120 MWh(-1) for power and up to $30 GJ(-1) ($1.1L(-1)) for green diesel were higher than current market prices, but a value for low-carbon energy would narrow the price differential.

AB  - While high-rise mass-timber construction is booming worldwide as a more sustainable alternative to mainstream cement and steel, in South America, there are still many gaps to overcome regarding sourcing, design, and environmental performance. The aim of this study was to assess the carbon emission footprint of using mass-timber products to build a mid-rise low-energy residential building in central Chile (CCL). The design presented at a solar decathlon contest in Santiago was assessed through lifecycle analysis (LCA) and compared to an equivalent mainstream concrete building. Greenhouse gas emissions, expressed as global warming potential (GWP), from cradle-to-usage over a 50-year life span, were lower for the timber design, with 131 kg CO2 eq/m(2) of floor area (compared to 353 kg CO2 eq/m(2)) and a biogenic carbon storage of 447 tons of CO2 eq/m(2) based on sustainable forestry practices. From cradle-to-construction, the embodied emissions of the mass-timber building were 42% lower (101 kg CO2 eq/m(2)) than those of the equivalent concrete building (167 kg CO2 eq/m(2)). The embodied energy of the mass-timber building was 37% higher than that of its equivalent concrete building and its envelope design helped reduce space-conditioning emissions by as much as 83%, from 187 kg CO2 eq/m(2) as estimated for the equivalent concrete building to 31 kg CO2 eq/m(2) 50-yr. Overall, provided that further efforts are made to address residual energy end-uses and end-of-life waste management options, the use of mass-timber products offers a promising potential in CCL for delivering zero carbon residential multistory buildings.

AB  - This paper explores the intersection between sustainability and social media activity by studying how user-generated content (UGC) creation enacted and communicated social sustainability in times of restricted social interaction. The context is Wuhan in China, a city that implemented a 76-day lockdown in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on a sample of 187 short videos created and posted by Wuhan residents on Douyin (TikTok) during the lockdown, this paper answers this question - how did UGC creators produce short videos on social media to facilitate social connections with others? UGC creators' video-making practices are conceptualised in the typology of Evoking, Performing, Collaborating, and Narrating, and each practice enabled creators to connect and socialise virtually with others, thus contributing to all participants' social sustainability in a pandemic. This study contributes to media management scholarship by adding knowledge to the understanding of two areas: the productive role of media audiences, especially their content production practices and logics; the nature of short videos as media products.

The attributes of landscape health are the working mechanisms of all open systems, and can be observed in the homeostatic behavior of forests, deserts and floodplains. These attributes are openness, self-regulation, storage and diversity. The attributes of health comprise criteria for evaluating and guiding land use. To maintain landscape health, land use design can maintain and restore these mechanisms during change of moderate pace and scale. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited

AB  - Intermunicipal consortia have proven to be an alternative in managing urban solid waste (USW), mainly for small municipalities seeking solutions both for treatment and final disposal of waste and for scale gain and resources optimization. This study aimed to propose a tool to assess the Technical, Economic, and Environmental Feasibility Study (EVTEA) applied in an intermunicipal public consortia in Minas Gerais, which was selected for the implementation of a pilot project by the Federal Government to hire specialized technical services necessary for structuring concession projects in the area of solid waste management. The methodology was structured in two stages: analysis of management, and billing mechanisms in the consortia municipalities; proposition and application of an EVTEA assessment tool for the management services applied in the consortia. The results of the first stage indicated that the small and small/medium-sized consortia municipalities need to advance in waste management by applying the principles of non-generation, reduction, reuse, and recycling, and promoting the social inclusion of collectors to achieve their sustainability. In the second stage, the assessment tool applied in a consortia made it possible to quantify the performance in the preparation of the study through the use of proposed indicators related to service and sufficiency of information to meet the analysis of the study. The consortia final assessment indicator (FAI) resulted as incomplete, that is, there is a need for a complete and sufficient approach regarding the quality of the information contained in its content to meet the guidelines for the structuring of projects related to the management of urban solid waste in the elaboration of the EVTEA.

AB  - Biofuel and bioenergy systems are integral to most climate stabilization scenarios for displacement of transport sector fossil fuel use and for producing negative emissions via carbon capture and storage (CCS). However, the net greenhouse gas mitigation benefit of such pathways is controversial due to concerns around ecosystem carbon losses from land use change and foregone sequestration benefits from alternative land uses. Here, we couple bottom-up ecosystem simulation with models of cellulosic biofuel production and CCS in order to track ecosystem and supply chain carbon flows for current and future biofuel systems, with comparison to competing land-based biological mitigation schemes. Analyzing three contrasting US case study sites, we show that on land transitioning out of crops or pasture, switchgrass cultivation for cellulosic ethanol production has per-hectare mitigation potential comparable to reforestation and severalfold greater than grassland restoration. In contrast, harvesting and converting existing secondary forest at those sites incurs large initial carbon debt requiring long payback periods. We also highlight how plausible future improvements in energy crop yields and biorefining technology together with CCS would achieve mitigation potential 4 and 15 times greater than forest and grassland restoration, respectively. Finally, we show that recent estimates of induced land use change are small relative to the opportunities for improving system performance that we quantify here. While climate and other ecosystem service benefits cannot be taken for granted from cellulosic biofuel deployment, our scenarios illustrate how conventional and carbon-negative biofuel systems could make a nearterm, robust, and distinctive contribution to the climate challenge.

AB  - Various land-use transitions in the tropics contribute to atmospheric carbon emissions, including forest conversion for small-scale farming, cattle ranching, and production of commodities such as soya and palm oil. These transitions involve fire as an effective and inexpensive means for clearing. We applied the DECAF (DEforestation CArbon Fluxes) model to Mato Grosso, Brazil to estimate fire emissions from various land-use transitions during 2001-2005. Fires associated with deforestation contributed 67 Tg C/yr (17 and 50 Tg C/yr from conversion to cropland and pasture, respectively), while conversion of savannas and existing cattle pasture to cropland contributed 17 Tg C/yr and pasture maintenance fires 6 Tg C/yr. Large clearings (>100 ha/yr) contributed 67% of emissions but comprised only 10% of deforestation events. From a policy perspective, results imply that intensification of agricultural production on already-cleared land and policies to discourage large clearings would reduce the major sources of emissions from fires in this region.

AB  - It has often been claimed that firms' compliance to environmental regulations is higher than predicted by standard theory, a result labeled the "Harrington paradox" in the literature. Enforcement data from Norway presented here appears, at first glance, to confirm this "stylized fact": firms are inspected less than once a year, detected violators are seldom fined, but still, serious violations seem relatively rare. However, at a closer look, the pattern seems less paradoxical: enforcement of minor violations is lax, but such violations do flourish; serious violations, on the other hand, are subject to credible threats of harsh punishment, and such violations are more uncommon. This seems quite consistent with predictions from standard theory. We argue that the empirical existence of the Harrington paradox is not well documented in the international literature. The claim that firms' compliance with environmental regulations is generally higher than predicted by standard theory should thus be regarded as a hypothesis rather than an established fact.

AB  - Many lowland rivers across northwest Europe exhibit broadly similar behavioural responses to glacial-interglacial transitions and landscape development. Difficulties exist in assessing these, largely because the evidence from many rivers remains limited and fragmentary. Here we address this issue in the context of the river Kennet, a tributary of the Thames, since c. 13,000 cal BP. Some similarities with other rivers are present, suggesting that regional climatic shifts are important controls. The Kennet differs from the regional pattern in a number of ways. The rate of response to sudden climatic change, particularly at the start of the Holocene and also mid-Holocene forest clearance, appears very high. This may reflect abrupt shifts between two catchment scale hydrological states arising from contemporary climates, land use change and geology. Stadial hydrology is dominated by nival regimes, with limited winter infiltration and high spring and summer runoff. Under an interglacial climate, infiltration is more significant. The probable absence of permafrost in the catchment means that a lag between the two states due to its gradual decay is unlikely. Palaeoecology, supported by radiocarbon dates, suggests that, at the very start of the Holocene, a dramatic episode of fine sediment deposition across most of the valley floor occurred, lasting 500-1000 years. A phase of peat accumulation followed as mineral sediment supply declined. A further shift led to tufa deposition, initially in small pools, then across the whole floodplain area, with the river flowing through channels cut in tufa and experiencing repeated avulsion. Major floods, leaving large gravel bars that still form positive relief features on the floodplain, followed mid-Holocene floodplain stability. Prehistoric deforestation is likely to be the cause of this flooding, inducing a major environmental shift with significantly increased surface runoff. Since the Bronze Age, predominantly fine sediments were deposited along the valley with apparently stable channels and vertical floodplain accretion associated with soil erosion and less catastrophic flooding. The Kennet demonstrates that, while a general pattern of river behaviour over time, within a region, may be identifiable, individual rivers are likely to diverge from this. Consequently, it is essential to understand catchment controls, particularly the relative significance of surface and subsurface hydrology. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This work aimed to evaluate the devilfish bone char as an alternative material to be used as a bioanode in a microbial fuel cell (MFC) applied in bioenergy production from the pantoprazole biodegradation. The devilfish is an invasive species in Mexico and other countries, so its control and eradication are based on the integral use of its biomass. In addition, the bones are unusable waste and could be used as a raw material to manufacture the bioanode. Two MFCs with an anaerobic anode single chamber of 125 mL were operated independently using the fabricated bioanode and the carbon felt (conventional anode). Both MFCs were fed with 1 g/L of pantoprazole as substrate with a chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 210 +/- 1.3 mg/L and 1.2 g of soil as inoculum. The two MFCs were characterized electrochemically, and the COD removal percentage was measured as an indicator of the pantoprazole biodegradation. The results showed that the MFC operated with the bioanode had a better performance than the conventional anode, since it reached a maximum power density of 1.22 mW/m2, being 156% higher than carbon felt. These values were consistent with the COD removal percentages reached in 10 days with values of 47.17 +/- 0.23 and 43.34 +/- 0.41%, respectively. Therefore, these findings provide a low-cost alternative carbonaceous material for the sustainable construction of MFC applied to produce bioenergy from the biodegradation of pharmaceutical products.

AB  - In order to reduce the overall emissions of greenhouse gases and to be in compliance with the current environmental regulations, a new class of refrigerants has appeared. Such refrigerants are generally multi-component systems that contain a fluorocompound mixed with CO2 and/or an alkane. In order to design processes involving such blends or to implement a product-design approach aimed at identifying new refrigerant mixtures, an equation of state (EoS) able to predict the properties of fluorocompound-containing systems is required. In order to reach this goal, it was decided in this study to add six fluorinated groups to the Enhanced-PPR78 model which combines the Peng-Robinson EoS and a group contribution method aimed at estimating the binary interaction parameters, k(ij)(T), involved in Van der Waals one-fluid mixing rules.

AB  - Political measures during the COVID-19 pandemic forced consumers to cancel flights, resulting in significant decreases of their individual greenhouse gas emissions. This paper introduces the concept of imposed flying sufficiency and asks whether this could lead to a flying rebound. Imposed flying sufficiency describes that external factors, such as political measures during the pandemic, force consumers to reduce their flights. The term flying rebound refers to the gap between the emissions that could be potentially saved due to flying sufficiency and the actualized emissions savings due to adjusted flying behavior. A major contribution of this paper is combining the economic mechanisms with moral-psychological aspects of rebound effects in an experimental study. In a 2 (with/without economic hint) x 2 (with/without ecological hint) between-subjects experimental study, this paper analyzes how the awareness of monetary savings and the awareness of ecological consequences affect consumers' flying intentions. The study reveals an interaction effect of these two aspects: While awareness of the monetary savings will increase flying intentions, awareness of the ecological consequences will buffer this effect. Furthermore, the degree to which consumers feel flight shame, strongly moderates the economic and ecological hints' impact. Finally, the paper provides implications for managers and policymakers.

AB  - Estimates of the daily ration consumed by decapod assemblages were obtained from 2 continuous sampling cycles conducted over the middle and lower slope (610-710 m and 1178-1240 m depth respectively) of the Catalan Sea (NW Mediterranean). Annual food consumption by decapods decreased from 82.2 mg dry weight (DW) m(-2) yr(-1) on the middle slope to 20.4 mg DW m(-2) yr(-1) on the lower slope. Additionally, from literature sources, the food consumption by fishes and the secondary production of macrobenthos and macroplankton were assessed for our deep-sea area. Combining the food consumption of megafauna (decapod crustaceans plus fishes), a model of the food supply-food consumption balance was proposed for the middle slope, the only depth stratum for which adequate information exists. On the middle slope, annual food consumption by megafauna amounted to 160 mg DW m(-2) yr(-1) while secondary production by the dominant macrobenthic taxa (suprabenthos, epibenthos and infauna) was estimated at 150 mg DW m(-2) yr(-1). Benthos was the main contributor to the food supply in our megafaunal mid-slope communities. The mean annual contribution of macroplankton was secondary, although it can be seasonally important. Euphausiids were the dominant macroplankton taxon over the middle slope, and only 10.6% of their secondary production (7.3 mg DW m(-2) yr(-1)) was estimated to be consumed by decapods, whereas the total estimated euphausiid production consumed by our mid-bathyal community hardly attained 20%. Our results showed a tight equilibrium between food consumption and food supply on the middle slope. Estimated food consumption by mid-slope megafauna (0.059 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) is equivalent to calculated Values for production by benthic and suprabenthic macrofauna. This value is also consistent with estimates of mid-slope organic carbon through sedimentation (1.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), after correcting for metabolism by benthos (from macrofauna to sediment bacteria). These results are consistent with the commonly accepted idea that food is the main limiting factor in deep-sea trophic webs.

AB  - Parents might use signals of need or of quality to decide food provisioning among their offspring, while the use of one or another signal might depend on food availability. Begging success of nestlings of different quality (i.e., body size) would also depend on food availability, and we here explore the effect of experimental food supply in begging success of nestlings and in provisioning of female hoopoes (Upupa epops), a species with extreme hatching asynchrony and nestlings size hierarchy. We video-recorded food allocation of females, begging success of nestlings of different size, and the social context (i.e., the size category of the other nestlings that were begging for food) during periods when experimental food supply was or was not available in the same nests. We found that when experimental food supplementation was present, begging success of the intermediate, but not that of large or small-sized nestlings, increased. The experiment, however, did not affect the feeding preferences of females toward nestlings of different size. Moreover, when small nestlings were the only ones that were begging for food, their begging success decreased in the experimental period, and females used supplemented prey to feed themselves. Those results, on one hand, confirm the importance of food availability for the begging success of nestlings of particular sizes and, on the other, indicate that females prefer to use extra food for their own rather than for the smallest nestlings. We discuss possible mechanisms explaining the detected experimental effects and the adaptive and nonadaptive explanations of mothers ignoring the small nestlings. Theoretically, parents should feed offspring that are begging for food; at least in situations of abundant resources. In accordance, during events of experimental food supply, medium-sized nestlings where feed more often. However, the begging behavior of small hoopoe nestlings were ignored by mothers even when only them were begging for food. In these situations, females used available prey to feed themselves. Possible functions of the existence of these condemned to die nestlings are discussed.

AB  - Food acquisition by ant colonies is a complex process that starts with acquiring food at the source (i.e., foraging) and culminates with food exchange in or around the nest (i.e., feeding). While ant foraging behavior is relatively well understood, the process of food distribution has received little attention, largely because of the lack of methodology that allows for accurate monitoring of food flow. In this study, we used the odorous house ant, Tapinoma sessile (Say) to investigate the effect of foraging arena size and structural complexity on the rate and the extent of spread of liquid carbohydrate food (sucrose solution) throughout a colony. To track the movement of food, we used protein marking and double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, DAS-ELISA. Variation in arena size, in conjunction with different colony sizes, allowed us to test the effect of different worker densities on food distribution. Results demonstrate that both arena size and colony size have a significant effect on the spread of the food and the number of workers receiving food decreased as arena size and colony size increased. When colony size was kept constant and arena size increased, the percentage of workers testing positive for the marker decreased, most likely because of fewer trophallactic interactions resulting from lower worker density. When arena size was kept constant and colony size increased, the percentage of workers testing positive decreased. Nonrandom (clustered) worker dispersion and a limited supply of food may have contributed to this result. Overall, results suggest that food distribution is more complete is smaller colonies regardless of the size of the foraging arena and that colony size, rather than worker density, is the primary factor affecting food distribution. The structural complexity of foraging arenas ranged from simple, two-dimensional space (empty arenas) to complex, three-dimensional space (arenas filled with mulch). The structural complexity of foraging arenas had a significant effect on food distribution and the presence of substrate significantly inhibited the spread of food. Structural complexity of foraging arenas and the resulting worker activity patterns might exert considerable influence on socioecological processes in ants and should be considered in laboratory assays.

AB  - As a significant source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, the municipal solid waste sector's greenhouse gas emission mode remains unknown, hampering effective decision-making on possible greenhouse gas emission reductions. Rapid urbanization and economic growth have resulted in massive volumes of municipal solid trash. As a result, identifying emission reduction routes for municipal solid waste treatment is critical. In this research, we investigate the potential of municipal solid waste treatment methods in lowering greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Shenzhen, a typical Chinese major city. The results showed that the combined treatment of 58% incineration, 2% landfill, and 40% anaerobic digestion (AD) had the lowest greenhouse gas emissions of about 5.91 million tons under all scenarios. The implementation of waste sorting and anaerobic digestion treatment of organic municipal solid waste after separate collection can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by simply increasing the incineration ratio.

AB  - Transportation energy demand has a significant impact on worldwide energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Accurate transportation energy demand predictions can help policy -makers develop and implement successful energy policies and strategies. In this study, a novel approach to predict transportation energy demand using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based on the Improved Red Fox Optimizer (IRFO) has been suggested. The proposed method utilizes the ANN model to solve the complex nonlinear relationships between transportation energy demand and its effective parameters including Gross Domestic Product (GDP), population, and vehicle numbers. Also, the IRFO algorithm was utilized to modify the ANN model's parameters to improve the prediction accuracy. The experimental findings demonstrate the ANN-IRFO model performs better than the other method in terms of accuracy and effectiveness. It predicts the growth of GDP, population, and vehicles number by 5.5 %, 4.8 %, and 4.2 %, respectively. The findings demonstrate that the suggested method can provide accurate forecasts for transportation energy demand, which can help decision-makers to make informed decisions and policies regarding energy management and sustainability.

We applied the Generalised Method of Moment (system-GMM) to analyse the data for the period 2005 to 2019. The results revealed that FDI improves environmental quality in the long run, whereas in the short run, FDI diminishes environmental quality when interacted with policies and institutions for environmental sustainability. Furthermore, policies and institutions for environmental sustainability and domestic investment improve environmental quality in both the long and short run. The study concludes that policies and institutions for environmental sustainability in SSA are important as they improve environmental quality. The study also finds policies and institutions for environmental sustainability complements with FDI to improve environmental quality in the long run. Finally, the study further establishes that domestic investment is important to improve environmental quality in SSA. The key findings call for strengthening policies for improving environmental quality in SSA.

AB  - Because forestry activities can both generate and remove greenhouse gases, forestry is a central issue in a proposed international climate change treaty, the Kyoto Protocol. The Protocol would require industrialized countries to meet targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions; developing countries would not have targets for now. To help meet its goals, an industrialized country could employ the so-called Clean Development Mechanism, which would provide credits for investing in emission reduction projects in developing countries. Some argue that projects involving forestry activities should be ineligible for credits, but neither the language of the treaty nor sound public policy warrant such an approach.

AB  - They are an important economic resource, and a source of food products, recreation, species habitat, and watershed protection, among many other services. Forests also may store large quantities of carbon. The threat of climate change therefore provides new impetus for forest management, in the form of forest carbon sequestration (FCS). FCS appears to be a relatively cheap way of reducing carbon in the atmosphere, relative to alternatives such as fuel switching. But FCS is not without problems. Economists' estimates of the cost-effectiveness of FCS are highly variable. Verification is difficult. And policy design is complex - not only because of the characteristics of forests themselves, but because of the limitations of current U.S. policy. Existing regulatory tools - predominantly the Clean Air Act - are largely incompatible in providing incentives for FCS. This paper explores the current state of FCS knowledge, including its policy context, and identifies an agenda for future research.

AB  - Forest cover dynamics (1993-2018) was assessed in two regions on the Yucatan Peninsula: Zona Maya (ZM), 67% indigenous with shifting cultivation and community forestry; and Bacalar-Rio Hondo (BRH), mainly commercial agriculture and pastureland. Degradation (12,915 ha y(-1)) exceeded deforestation (5882 ha y(-1)) and was worse in BRH. In BRH there was a net forest loss (-1.6% y(-1)) associated with pastureland and commercial agriculture. In ZM, mature forest recovery (1.4% y(-1)) and dynamic forest cover (continuous loss and gain) were associated with shifting cultivation. Changes were more intense during 2011-2018 and gains of mature forest in ZM and deforested areas in BRH targeted secondary vegetation. Fragments of mature and secondary vegetation decreased, and connectivity improved in ZM, but opposite trends occurred in BRH. Reporting and monitoring deforestation using Global Forest Watch data is inadequate since 62% of forest cover loss represent degrading or recovering forest cover.

AB  - An assessment of community exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) was undertaken in Paritutu, New Zealand. The suburb lies adjacent to an agrichemical facility that produced 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T), between 1962 and 1987. Soil TCDD measurements from 73 nearby addresses demonstrated a pattern of TCDD deposition consistent with an aerial plume following the prevailing local wind patterns and the agrichemical plant as the point source. Blood samples were taken from 52 volunteers having lived for three or more years in Paritutu between 1962 and 1987. Candidate selection focused primarily on individuals who were most likely to show elevated TCDD blood lipid levels when compared to age and gender stratified national average blood concentrations, and secondarily on individuals that provided additional information about specific exposure periods, potential exposures of younger age groups, and specific dietary patterns. A multipathway exposure model was used to estimate serum TCDD levels in each participant. Age and gender-specific TCDD elimination kinetics were also considered. Historical TCDD environmental concentrations were back-calculated from soil concentrations at each residence assuming TCDD releases occurred pre-dominantly between 1962 and 1975. Serum was analysed for chlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans, and a subset was analysed for dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls. TCDD in serum lipid exceeded two standard deviations above national background levels for 14 participants, and 3 standard deviations for 10 participants. The highest TCDD lipid concentration was 33.3 ng/kg-lipid, or 11 times higher than the comparative 1997 national average. Elevated TCDD concentrations were observed primarily, but not exclusively, in the older study participants who had been in residence in Paritutu before 1968. The study demonstrated TCDD exposure in this community, occurring most likely through the aerial route, and most probably from fugitive emissions during manufacture. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study relies on environmental stewardship, a stakeholder-enlarged view of stewardship theory, and institutional theory to analyze the relationship between CEO compensation and firms' environmental commitment in a worldwide sample of 520 large listed firms. Our findings show that environment friendly firms pay their CEOs less total compensation and rely less on incentive-based compensation than environment careless firms. This negative relationship is stronger in institutional contexts where national environmental regulations are weaker. Our findings have important theoretical meaning and practical implications. Results show that CEOs do not necessarily act opportunistically; rather some of them may be willing to act as stewards of the natural environment and accept a lower, less incentive-based compensation from environment friendly firms. This study also provides evidence of the important influence of the institutional context in setting-up CEO compensation as the relationship is stronger when national environmental regulations are weaker. Our findings question the universal validity of agency theory in explaining CEO compensation. Compensation based on pecuniary incentives might be less indicated to motivate CEOs who feel rewarded by playing a stewardship role for environment friendly firms. When designing compensation for CEOs, compensation committees and external compensation advisors should consider psychological and institutional factors that might affect CEO motivation.

We show that each year the distribution obeys a power law and that the key parameter measures the degree of inequality. Our main finding is that more inequality amongst the wealthiest is associated with higher economic growth.

AB  - Deforestation is considered a major threat to biodiversity across many parts of the globe, but the biological impacts of this dramatic ecosystem disturbance often remain incompletely understood. In New Zealand - the world's last major landmass to be colonised by humans - widespread deforestation over recent centuries has left a highly fragmented suite of relict forest stands, ideal for assessing anthropogenic biological change. We hypothesise that this widespread environmental disturbance has underpinned repeated and predictable ecological shifts across distinct rivers and regions. Here we use freshwater environmental DNA (eDNA) data (113 samples across 38 locations; 89 insect taxa) to test for concordant biological shifts linked to this deforestation. eDNA analyses highlight consistent compositional and functional differentiation between forested versus deforested assemblages, including turnover of 'cryptic' congeneric taxa that are morphologically similar yet ecologically and genetically distinct. These dramatic biological shifts are evident even over fine spatial scales within streams, emphasising the widespread emergence of a novel 'deforested' assemblage. Our results illustrate that environmental change can drive predictable biological shifts across broad geographic regions, and highlight the power of eDNA for assessing anthropogenic ecosystem change over large geographic scales.

AB  - Three crises-climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, and extreme economic and social inequality intersect and have had devastating impacts on workers' rights to health, as well as the right to decent work, an underlying determinant of health. Yet these crises may act as catalysts, as responses present opportunities for transformation. Indeed, multiple international governance institutions and nongovernmental organizations have proposed new social contracts that aim to address the multiple challenges facing workers today. These initiatives promise to transform society to make workers and their families healthier and the planet more sustainable. They join and supplement earlier efforts at transformation, such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This article critiques (1) the market-fundamentalist neoliberal social contract, which gave rise to, or exacerbated, the three crises, and (2) the 2030 agenda and recent International Labour Organization proposals, which are all built on this neoliberal platform. Finally, the article argues for a social contract that is grounded in human rights-specifically worker rights-to address these crises and ensure greater protection of the health

AB  - Over the past 30 years, British unions have been marginalised from economic policymaking. Union membership and collective bargaining coverage have fallen dramatically, and the sometimes negative economic impact of unions at the workplace level has disappeared. While strong unions were once key contributors to macroeconomic problems such as high inflation, the weakening of organised labour has created other economic problems for policymakers in Britain, such as rising inequality. The social and political consequences of deepening inequality may force a reconsideration of the role of both the state and of unions in upholding labour standards.

AB  - In recent years large academic research libraries have acquired and made available to their users numerous information technologies designed to facilitate information retrieval and support the research process. Ranging from online computer catalogs, databases, and electronic journals to Internet-based resources, these new products are costly for university libraries but are acquired because of the much-enhanced access to information they offer for both faculty and students. This paper examines data collected in two surveys, four years apart, for a group of university faculty chemists who were queried about their use of electronic resources. The two surveys represent a long term, and continuing, effort to document the adoption of technological innovations by university faculty. The role of librarians as change agents will be explored as will issues related to promotion and training of faculty in the use of electronic resources.

AB  - Animal behaviour is remarkably sensitive to disruption by chemical pollution, with widespread implications for ecological and evolutionary processes in contaminated wildlife populations. However, conventional approaches applied to study the impacts of chemical pollutants on wildlife behaviour seldom address the complexity of natural environments in which contamination occurs. The aim of this review is to guide the rapidly developing field of behavioural ecotoxicology towards increased environmental realism, ecological complexity, and mechanistic understanding. We identify research areas in ecology that to date have been largely overlooked within behavioural ecotoxicology but which promise to yield valuable insights, including within- and among-individual variation, social networks and collective behaviour, and multi-stressor interactions. Further, we feature methodological and technological innovations that enable the collection of data on pollutant-induced behavioural changes at an unprecedented resolution and scale in the laboratory and the field. In an era of rapid environmental change, there is an urgent need to advance our understanding of the real-world impacts of chemical pollution on wildlife behaviour. This review therefore provides a roadmap of the major outstanding questions in behavioural ecotoxicology and highlights the need for increased cross-talk with other disciplines in order to find the answers.

AB  - The assumption that fuelwood and fodder extraction leads to deforestation has so far been the dominant mainstream view in deforestation discourses accepted by researchers, state agencies and conservationists. These mainstream views on deforestation ignore the local-specific strategies, which include substitution of crop residues and animal dung for fuelwood, changing livestock composition that reduces dependency on natural forest and local informal institutions that regulate the resource exploitation. Communities adjacent to forests mostly use dry wood as fuelwood and grasses for fodder that normally does not involve cutting of trees. Household fuelwood and fodder extraction patterns in villages in and out of the Sariska Tiger Reserve (STR), Rajasthan, India, were therefore analyzed. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire administered to 180-sample households, followed by field observations and focus group discussions in 37 villages. Certain household characteristics and distance to the source of fuelwood and fodder point to the role of opportunity cost as a determinant of biomass extraction. Fuelwood and fodder extraction may not be the major reason for deforestation. However, state agencies find it convenient to use the mainstream views related to deforestation and exclude local communities from forests and protected areas. Local people would prefer that their access rights to resources should continue. Co-management of forests involving local people and institutions, and restoration of their rights may help to resolve conflicts related to resource use and lead to a better management of natural resources.

AB  - The carbon footprint of shale gas combusted in Europe was estimated from nine European shale gas plays as potential production regions. Greenhouse gas emission sources during shale gas production, such as fugitives from hydraulic fracturing or combustion emissions from horizontal drilling, were added to emissions occurring for conventional gas extraction. Greenhouse gas emissions are expressed as g CO2-equivalents per MJ delivered, and calculated for a kWh of electricity generated. Estimated total GHG emissions from the use of European shale gas for electricity production range from 0.42 to 0.75 kg CO2-eq/kWh when the combustion in the power plant is included. This is within the range reported in the literature. The cumulative carbon footprints for a number of fossil electricity generation scenarios for Europe were also calculated. The results indicate an advantage of gas over other fossil sources in a wide range of scenarios. These results are only reversed with very high (10%) upstream losses for shale gas. With the current knowledge there is still a substantial climate benefit of replacing coal with (shale) gas even in the EU reference scenario.

AB  - Offshore wind energy provides a promising option for substituting conventional energies due to its low greenhouse gas emissions, cost-effectiveness, and abundant wind resources at seas. The installed capacity, available area, technological advancements, and wind resource development under climate change drive the offshore wind potential. Thus, the goal is to develop 28 techno-climatic wind energy expansion scenarios, considering installed capacity expansion paths and potential wind farm sites to estimate the national and global wind energy yield in 2025-2054. The study tests the hypothesis that technological advancements are more influential for future offshore wind energy yield compared to climate-related wind resource changes. Globally, at more than 80 % of studied sites, the capacity factors significantly decrease under all evaluated climate change scenarios in 2025-2054. However, it should not hinder future offshore wind expansion since the climate change-induced wind resource change is far less than the capacity factor variability of the potential wind farm sites within the exclusive economic zones. This study also found that if the wind energy expansion continues at the same pace as in 2019-2023 until 2030, China could gain the highest average energy yield at 280.9 TWh annually. Besides, the results indicate that the wind turbine type is more critical to the capacity factor than the climate change impact. At 87.9 % of all evaluated sites, the 10 MW reference wind turbine yields the highest capacity factors out of seven reference wind turbines tested.

AB  - Distributed power generation electricity generation that is produced by many small stationary power generators distributed throughout an urban air basin has the potential to supply a significant portion of electricity in future years. As a result, distributed generation may lead to increased pollutant emissions within an urban air basin, which could adversely affect air quality. However, the use of combined heating and power with distributed generation may reduce the energy consumption for space heating and air conditioning, resulting in a net decrease of pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions. This work used a systematic approach based on land-use geographical information system data to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of distributed generation emissions in the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin of California and simulated the potential air quality impacts using state-of-the-art three-dimensional computer models. The evaluation of the potential market penetration of distributed generation focuses on the year 2023. In general, the air quality impacts of distributed generation were found to be small due to the restrictive 2007 California Air Resources Board air emission standards applied to all distributed generation units and due to the use of combined heating and power. Results suggest that if distributed generation units were allowed to emit at the current Best Available Control Technology standards (which are less restrictive than the 2007 California Air Resources Board standards), air quality impacts of distributed generation could compromise compliance with the federal 8-hr average ozone standard in the region.

AB  - Residential sector accounts for 17% of domestic energy use and 14% of the greenhouse gas emissions in Canada. Improving the energy performance of the Canadian residential building stock is vital in achieving climate action goals. A comprehensive review of popular building energy rating systems noted their lack of life cycle thinking. The scope of the popular rating systems is limited to operational performance, ignoring the condition of the assets. This paper proposes a condition assessment framework for the energy system of existing multi-unit residential buildings (MURB), which combines the concepts of asset rating and operational rating. Indicators were identified to define energy, environmental, economic, and asset performance of MURB. A life cycle assessment was conducted to quantify the overall environmental impacts of energy technologies from point of generation. A fuzzy logic-based approach was used to overcome the challenges due to data uncertainty and impreciseness. A case study was conducted for a residential building at UBC Okanagan, Canada. The weights at indicator level and category level were defined based on stakeholder consultation, while also considering different decision scenarios. A fuzzy rule-based approach was used to combine the different performance categories to obtain an overall condition rating. The results indicate that the performance of the case study building can be rated as "good" under operational, asset, and overall categories. The findings of this research can be used to improve the asset and operational management strategies in existing buildings and can inform the key stakeholders during the operational phase of the buildings.

AB  - We comprehensively investigated the biodiversity of fungal communities in different developmental stages of Trypophloeus klimeschi and the difference between sexes and two generations by high throughput sequencing. The predominant species found in the intestinal fungal communities mainly belong to the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Fungal community structure varies with life stage. The genera Nakazawaea, Trichothecium, Aspergillus, Didymella, Villophora, and Auricularia are most prevalent in the larvae samples. Adults harbored high proportions of Graphium. The fungal community structures found in different sexes are similar. Fusarium is the most abundant genus and conserved in all development stages. Gut fungal communities showed notable variation in relative abundance during the overwintering stage. Fusarium and Nectriaceae were significantly increased in overwintering mature larvae. The data indicates that Fusarium might play important roles in the survival of T. klimeschi especially in the overwintering stage. The authors speculated that Graphium plays an important role in the invasion and colonization of T. klimeschi. The study will contribute to the understanding of the biological role of the intestinal fungi in T. klimeschi, which might provide an opportunity and theoretical basis to promote integrated pest management (IPM) of T. klimeschi.

AB  - This paper tests the relationship between gender diversity on boards and firms' environmental policy. Based on prior research, we predict that gender diversity on boards of directors should have a positive relationship with firms' environmental policy. Moreover, firm character in terms of pollution creation likelihood moderates the relationship between gender diversity on boards and firms' environmental policy. Analyzing data from 865 publicly listed firms in the United States, we found direct and significant empirical evidence for our predictions. According to the findings, we highlight the importance of gender diversity for the development of good firm environmental policy as well as for the improvement of corporate governance. Moreover, the more likely firms in a given industry are to cause environmental pollution, the more salient will be the beneficial effect of gender diversity on boards on firms' environmental policy in the industry.

AB  - While operating under different names, both Europe and Russia are currently going through a period of social change in academia. Europe is pursuing reforms and transformation of academia in the context of the New Public Management, while Russia operates in similar settings of modernization, thus addressing excellence and effectiveness of academic work. In both cases, the processes underlying social change in academia result in a similar impact on female scholars' occupational advancement. By doing so, they reproduce the existing gender inequalities and create new ones. Russia finds itself in a paradoxical situation: while women represent the majority of (scientific) staff in academia, they face persistent discrimination at the hands of their colleagues - both male and female. Still, our knowledge of gender disparities and discrimination in Russian academia is fragmented and needs extensive investigation. In order to establish the necessary foundation for further systematic analysis, this paper aims to reduce the existing gap by examining gender inequalities from a historical perspective.

AB  - Water plays a pivotal role in economic activity and in human well-being. Because of the prominence of water in production (primarily for irrigation) and in domestic use (drinking, washing, cooking), conflict over water and the effects of gender-influenced decisions about water mall, have far-reaching consequences on human well-being, economic growth, and social change. At the same time, social conflicts and social change arc shaped and mediated, often in unexpected ways, by the natural conditions in which water occurs. The social relations of water are poorly understood. This article introduces a framework for disaggregating conditions of access to water and uses it to examine three pressing questions in Bangladesh. First, extraction of groundwater for irrigation has made manY drinking-water hand pumps run dry. Second, increasing use of groundwater for drinking has been associated with the poisoning of at least 20 million people through naturally occurring arsenic in groundwater. Third, the article examines some of the ways access to water has been changed by the rise of shrimp aquaculture for export. This article highlights new directions for the analysis of interactions among water, class, and gender. The existing literature has tended to focus on the implications of gender analysis for government policy, especially development projects and water resources management, and for women's organization. In this article we begin to sketch some questions that arise from a concern to understand the broader context of social change.

AB  - This paper examines the gender distribution of the benefits of economic growth in several Asian economies from 1970-90. Using Borda rank ordering, we compare the progress made in these countries towards closing the gender gap in well-being. In addition to commonly-used indicators, trends in the ratio of females to males in the population are examined. We explore determinants of changes in this ratio, using regression analysis. The results indicate that gender equity in quality-of-life ratings is highest in those Asian economies that grew the slowest over the period in question. Further, the data indicate that economic growth does not have a significant effect on the female-to-male population ratios for this set of countries. Variables that affect women's bargaining power do, however, have a positive effect on relative female life chances, as does spending on public education.

AB  - Purpose - The primary objective of this study is to test whether gender differences in job satisfaction are assignable to variations in labour market and welfare state regimes in the light of gender-related labour market modernization. Design/methodology/approach - Using data derived from the European Household Community Panel (EHCP) and covering 14 member states of the European Union the study constructs a series of summary statistics to lay the foundation for the analysis. An ordinary ordered-probit regression model is employed to test for the (non-) emergence of a gender-job satisfaction paradox. Findings - The results suggest that objective (socio-economic and institutional) determinants of labour market status and subjective (assessed and evaluated) perspectives are mutually complementary. The more restrictive the labour market access and process is for women, the more likely a gender-job satisfaction paradox is to emerge in any country. Equal opportunities for women and men (such as those observed in Scandinavian countries) indicate that the gender-job satisfaction paradox does not appear anymore due to a fading-out process over past decades, which was driven by appropriate institutional labour market interventions. Originality/value - The gender-job satisfaction paradox was confirmed for the UK, whereas little has been done to test this hypothesis on a cross-national basis. This investigation thus fills the gap in the empirical literature.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a warm-season, perennial grass valued as a promising candidate species for bioenergy feedstock production. Biomass yield is the most important trait for any bioenergy feedstock. This study was focused on understanding the genetics underlying biomass yield and feedstock quality traits in a "Kanlow" population. The objectives of this study were to (i) assess genetic variation (ii) estimate the narrow sense heritability, and (iii) predict genetic gain per cycle of selection for biomass yield and the components of lignocelluloses. Fifty-four Kanlow half-sib (KHS) families along with Kanlow check were planted in a randomized complete block design with three replications at two locations in Tennessee: Knoxville and Crossville. The data were recorded for two consecutive years: 2013 and 2014. The result showed a significant genetic variation for biomass yield (p < 0.05), hemicellulose concentration (p < 0.05), and lignin concentration (p < 0.01). The narrow sense heritability estimates for biomass yield was very low (0.10), indicating a possible challenge to improve this trait. A genetic gain of 16.5% is predicted for biomass yield in each cycle of selection by recombining parental clones of 10% of superior progenies.

AB  - After the Common Agricultural Policy reform of 1992 and the application of ago-environmental measures, most EU countries have introduced specific measures for wildlife habitat improvement. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of two habitat improvement actions on brown hare Lepus europaeus and roe deer Capreolus capreolus populations in two study areas in the hills of Emilia-Romagna in Italy. The study was carried out from October 1996 to October 1997. Data on brown hares were collected at night using spotlights. Density was estimated at 26 (area A) and 29 (area B) sampling sites. Data on roe deer were collected at 17 sampling sites (fields observed) during 2-hour periods, before sunset and after sunrise, respectively, using binoculars. We recorded 736 brown hares. Brown hare density was higher in study area A (0.27 individuals/ha) than in study area B (0.23 individuals/ha). We counted 153 roe deer during the diurnal surveys. The highest roe deer density was observed in February-March 1997 (0.306 individuals/ha). We used Bonferroni confidence intervals, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests to compare the densities in different habitats. Brown hares avoided uncultivated fields in both study areas, while they selected habitat improvements in area A and forage crops in area B. Roe deer selected habitat improvements and secondarily forage crops, but avoided uncultivated fields. Our study demonstrates that extensive cultivated fields (maintained or reintroduced according to EU agro-environmental regulations) can play an important role in territories with agriculture retirement and abandonment, acting primarily as a source of food (mostly green forage) for several herbivorous wildlife species.

AB  - Giant sequoias (Sequoiadendron giganteum) are some of the UK's largest trees, despite only being introduced in the mid-nineteenth century. There are an estimated half a million giant sequoias and closely related coastal redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) in the UK. Given the recent interest in planting more trees, partly due to their carbon sequestration potential and also their undoubted public appeal, an understanding of their growth capability is important. However, little is known about their growth and carbon uptake under UK conditions. Here, we focus on S. giganteum and use three-dimensional terrestrial laser scanning to perform detailed structural measurements of 97 individuals at three sites covering a range of different conditions, to estimate aboveground biomass (AGB) and annual biomass accumulation rates. We show that UK-grown S. giganteum can sequester carbon at a rate of 85 kg yr-1, varying with climate, management and age. We develop new UK-specific allometric models for S. giganteum that fit the observed AGB with r 2 > 0.93 and bias < 2% and can be used to estimate S. giganteum biomass more generally. This study provides the first estimate of the growth and carbon sequestration of UK open-grown S. giganteum and provides a baseline for estimating their longer-term carbon sequestration capacity.

The video entertainment sector, which spans these industries, exemplifies how the traditional linear value chain transforms as platform-based business models play more pronounced mediation roles. Drawing upon insights from platform theory, this article synthesizes interviews with 22 executives at key positions throughout the video value chain to identify and confront three key questions that will define the future of the telecommunications, media, and entertainment sectors: (1) Who will come out on top as the video market transforms?; (2) Will people own content or only subscribe to video services?; and (3) Will advertising agencies maintain control of media buying? This article ascertains the critical factors and requisite conditions that will determine the answers to these questions and the future shape of the telecommunications, media, and entertainment industries.

AB  - This review analyzes the effects of economic growth and technological progress on the environment, exploring how modern technology and human behaviors are adapted to minimize environmental impact and promote sustainable development. It examines the role of economic networks and input-output models in understanding intersectoral connections and trade flows, particularly in the context of climate change mitigation and adaptation. Special emphasis is placed on carbon sequestration technologies and carbon accounting methodologies, which are essential for monitoring emissions, assessing carbon footprints, and formulating effective climate policies. Over the past decade, researchers have extensively studied the relationship between economic growth and climate change using various econometric methodologies. The Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis suggests that at a certain stage of development, further economic growth can lead to reduced pollution levels. Sector-specific approaches highlight potential solutions for climate change mitigation, emphasizing the need for synergy between technological innovations and human behavior. Carbon sequestration, carbon capture and utilization, and pro-environmental practices play pivotal roles in this transition. By integrating policy support, community engagement, and awareness programs, societies can foster a transformation towards a sustainable future, balancing economic growth with environmental responsibility. This review highlights the intricate relationships between economic systems, technological advancement, and environmental sustainability, offering insights into effective strategies for addressing climate challenges.

AB  - The Member States of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change are required to periodically publish their national inventories of anthropogenic emissions in National Inventory Reports. The data used in this paper was extracted from these reports and applied to generate a study of the development of greenhouse gas emissions in the waste management sector. The results show a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions for developed contries/regions from 1990 to 2016 due to improved collection and treatment of landfill gas, a shift from landfilling to biological and thermal treatment, as well as a shift to separate waste collection and treatment. The developing countries and regions show another development of greenhouse gas emissions. On the one hand, their greenhouse gas emissions from the waste sector strongly increased due to higher generation of waste. And on the other hand, they increased due in most cases to unorganized and technically insufficent disposal of mixed waste on dumpsites along with better observation of disposal sites and therefore better registration of emissions. Nevertheless, the per capita emissions in developed countries/regions are with approx. 500 kg CO2-eq./a much higher than for developing and emerging countries/regions, which just emit around 100 kg CO2-eq./a.

AB  - Ecological modernisation (EM) provides the principal framework within which environmental policy reform projects are understood. However, writers using the approach, neglect to explain the political contexts within which it is possible to pursue such projects. Specifically, they ignore how discourses of globalisation structure the attempts of states to introduce environmental policy measures consistent with EM agendas. Through an analysis of the UK government's attempts to introduce policies consistent with an EM approach, we show that New Labour's discourse of globalisation acts to create opportunities for EM in some policy arenas and hinder them in others. We examine the development of a renewable energy strategy, the case of genetically modified foods, and transport policy. By specifying conditions under which EM may be pursued, the analysis reveals the potential, but also the limits, of this approach, which attempts to ignore the deep political questions raised by environmental degradation.

AB  - Effective communication strategies are fundamental to achieving sustainable consumption, yet there is a gap in the literature with respect to their design. Moreover, there is considerable debate with respect to the starting point for such strategies: whether the shift to sustainable consumption can be achieved within the dominant social paradigm or whether a new paradigm is required. Fair trade (FT) marketing presents a valuable case study of these issues in practice. Case analysis of a campaign by the Divine Chocolate Company suggests the importance of transcending the polarization of the radical and pragmatic visions of FT and also the within or without dichotomy of macromarketing in terms of moving consumers along a pathway to sustainable development. The campaign's synergism further has significant implications for the design of communication strategies to effect sustainable consumption. These are presented in terms of two working propositions for exploration in alternative contexts.

AB  - Whilst there is much discussion about the stringency of environmental regulations and the variability of industrial environmental performance in different countries, there are very few robust evaluations that allow meaningful comparisons to be made. This is partly because data scarcity restricts the ability to make 'like for like' comparisons across countries and over time. This paper combines data on benzene emissions from Pollution Release and Transfer Registers with data on industrial production from oil refineries to generate normalized measures of industrial environmental performance across eight Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries and the EU-15. We find that normalized emissions levels are improving in nearly all countries, and that there is some convergence in emissions performance between countries, but that there are still very significant variations across countries. We find that average emissions levels are lower in Japan and Germany than in the USA and Australia, which in turn are lower than in Canada and the EU-15, but we note that average emissions in the EU-15 are significantly affected by particularly high emissions in the UK. These findings have significant implications for wider debates on the stringency of environmental regulations and the variability of industrial environmental performance in different countries.

AB  - The 'fit-for-purpose' (FFP) approach was developed to respond to the challenges that the creation of a sustainable land administration system (LAS) faces. FFP has proved its value in integrating technological innovations such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in LAS. Technological innovations need to consider the governance context when being implemented. Understanding the relevance of the FFP approach and acknowledging the importance of the governance context, this research applies the 'Fit-for-purpose governance assessment framework' (FGAF). FGAF helps to understand the challenges that the implementation of UAVs can face in the LAS in Kenya. This governance assessment is based on 16 semi-structured in-depth interviews, three one-day workshops with local stakeholders and UAVs pilot studies to test the technology. The findings suggest that there are major and minor challenges concerning different attributes of FFP qualities. The governance context across counties is fragmented with a high degree of uncertainty and uneven capacity conditions. There are overlapping responsibilities and trust issues among the different actors. Participation of private and non-governmental actors is limited. Yet, steps have been taken toward the adoption of innovative approaches. Although financial resources are limited, the diversity of local and international stakeholders can work as a leverage point to support the implementation of UAVs in the mid and long-term.

AB  - China's carbon emission trading policy plays a crucial role in achieving both its "3060" dual carbon objectives and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 13 (SDG 13) on climate action. The policy's effectiveness in reducing pollution and mitigating carbon emissions holds significant importance. This paper investigated whether China's carbon emission trading policy affects pollution reduction (PM2.5 and SO2) and carbon mitigation (CO2) in pilot regions, using panel data from 30 provinces and municipalities in China from 2005 to 2019 and employing a multi-period difference-in-differences (DID) model. Furthermore, it analyzed the heterogeneity of carbon market mechanisms and regional variations. Finally, it examined the governance pathways for pollution reduction and carbon mitigation from a holistic perspective. The results indicate that: (1) China's carbon emission trading policy has reduced CO2 emissions by 18% and SO2 emissions by 36% in pilot areas, with an immediate impact on the "carbon mitigation" effect, while the "pollution reduction" effect exhibits a time lag. (2) Higher carbon trading prices lead to stronger "carbon mitigation" effect, and larger carbon market scales are associated with greater "pollution reduction" effects on PM2.5. Governance effects on pollution reduction and carbon mitigation vary among pilot regions: Carbon markets of Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, and Tianjin show significant governance effects in both "pollution reduction" and "carbon mitigation", whereas Guangdong's carbon market exhibits only a "pollution reduction" effect, and Hubei's carbon market demonstrates only a "carbon mitigation" effect. (3) Currently, China's carbon emission trading policy achieves pollution reduction and carbon mitigation through "process management" and "end-of-pipe treatment". This study could provide empirical insights and policy implications for pollution reduction and carbon mitigation, as well as for the development of China's carbon emission trading market.

AB  - Social sustainability is a topic that is gaining increased attention and yet has not been overly discussed, in particular with reference to the fashion industry. There is a shift in consumer demands, where brands are urged to stand for values, affect change in the industry, and have a clear purpose and positive impact over society. At the same time, brands are struggling to provide offers beyond products, or product-related experiences, at the risk of dissatisfying consumers expectations. Part of such dissatisfaction is clearly represented by the lack of footfall in retail stores and the fast-pace abandonment of the high-street by brands that cannot afford empty stores. This paper suggests an opportunity to rethink the retail store functionality as a space for brands to provide consumers with educational initiatives related to important societal issues, hence build their socially responsible profile. A netnographic exploratory analysis of Patagonia platforms was conducted in order to pinpoint potential positive reaction to a purpose-driven brand and its educational initiatives. The brand was chosen due to its value-committed strategy and constant educational effort towards consumers, both offline (product-related) and online (societal-related). This paper suggests that brands such as Patagonia, purpose and value driven in positively impacting society, should bring their activism and educational efforts on the high-street and in the retail spaces. By doing so, brands would concurrently provide consumers with experiences beyond product consumption, could revitalise our high-street, and could reinstate a sense of community belonging while raise their socially sustainable profile. This paper contributes to the existing literature of consumer education in retailing by expanding into the specific domain of fashion, a domain in which many social issues could be successfully addressed through a socially-driven consumer education at the moment still overlooked by researchers and brands.

AB  - Green building is one of measures been put forward to mitigate significant impacts of the building stock on the environment, society and economy. However, there is lack of a systematic review of this large number of studies that is critical for the future endeavor. The last decades have witnessed rapid growing number of studies on green building. This paper reports a critical review of the existing body of knowledge of researches related to green building. The common research themes and methodology were identified. These common themes are the definition and scope of green building; quantification of benefits of green buildings compared to conventional buildings; and various approaches to achieve green buildings. It is found that the existing studies played predominately focus on the environmental aspect of green building. Other dimensions of sustainability of green building, especially the social sustainability is largely overlooked. Future research opportunities were identified such as effects of climatic conditions on the effectiveness of green building assessment tools, validation of real performance of green buildings, unique demands of specific population, and future proofing.

AB  - Contemporary ecological models of health prominently feature the natural environment as fundamental to the ecosystem services that support human life, health, and well-being. The natural environment encompasses and permeates all other spheres of influence on health. Reviews of the natural environment and health literature have tended, at times intentionally, to focus on a limited subset of ecosystem services as well as health benefits stemming from the presence, and access and exposure to, green infrastructure. The sweeping influence of green infrastructure on the myriad ecosystem services essential to health has therefore often been underrepresented. This survey of the literature aims to provide a more comprehensive picturein the form of a primerof the many simultaneously acting health co-benefits of green infrastructure. It is hoped that a more accurately exhaustive list of benefits will not only instigate further research into the health co-benefits of green infrastructure but also promote consilience in the many fields, including public health, that must be involved in the landscape conservation necessary to protect and improve health and well-being.

AB  - The relationship between green innovation and environmental regulations has received increasing attention from researchers, gaining prominence both in academia and in organizations. Thus, this study aims to present a summary of the most relevant academic researches that relate the environmental regulations and green innovation, knowing in a standardized way the scientific information of this field of study. Through a systematic literature review, 96 academic papers published in the journals of Science Direct, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, between 2011 and 2019, were analyzed. The results showed that environmental regulations are among the main factors that induce companies to green innovation, given that most of the articles analyzed have a positive relationship. However, as there are still contradictions in the literature, new studies are emerging addressing this relationship with other organizational aspects, and considering the different mechanisms of environmental regulations to try to explain how and under what conditions these policies affect green innovation in companies. These findings can contribute to the researchers for the formation of a solid conceptual base on the subject, guiding for future research.

AB  - This study investigates whether and, if so, how efficiently government support (GS) and environmental regulations (ER) affect green innovation (GI), with a focus on the mediating roles of green intellectual capital (GIC) and open innovation (OI), using the natural-resources-based view (NRBV) and knowledge-based theory (KBT). Utilising a questionnaire-based survey of 508 respondents and partial least squares-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) for data analysis, the research finds that GS and ER positively relate to GI. The study demonstrates that OI and green human capital (GHC) mediate the impact of GS and ER on GI, respectively, advancing empirical evidence on the complex dynamics of green innovation in the context of Vietnamese small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Vietnam. This research enriches the understanding of green innovation dynamics and offers insights into leveraging government support and environmental regulations for enhancing green innovation through intellectual capital and open innovation strategies.

AB  - The importance of reducing U.S. oil dependence may have changed in light of developments in the world oil market over the past two decades. Since 2005, increased domestic production and decreased oil use have cut U.S. import dependence in half. The direct costs of oil dependence to the U.S. economy are estimated under four U.S. Energy Information Administration Scenarios to 2040. The key premises of the analysis are that the primary oil market failure is the use of market power by OPEC and that U.S. economic vulnerability is a result of the quantity of oil consumed, the lack of readily available, economical substitutes and the quantity of oil imported. Monte Carlo simulations of future oil market conditions indicate that the costs of U.S. oil dependence are likely to increase in constant dollars but decrease relative to U.S. gross domestic product unless oil resources are larger than estimated by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Reducing oil dependence therefore remains a valuable goal for U.S. energy policy and an important co-benefit of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The success of a large scale macroalgae-based biorefinery is dependent on the demonstration of favorable system economics and environmental sustainability. This study uses detailed process modeling to quantify the mass and energy flows through the various unit operations required for a novel free-floating macroalgae biorefinery concept. The modular process model served as the foundation for the techno-economic and global warming potential analyses used to quantify the sustainability of the proposed concept. This work includes detailed techno-economic results for a complete macroalgae cultivation and conversion system with multiple hatchery configurations and several emerging technologies. System optimization was achieved through the evaluation of various technology options for each unit operation. Technologies considered include traditional twine and textile substrate hatchery configurations, drone assisted seeding and biomass transport, mechanized line seeding and harvesting, adhesive spore mixtures that simplify seeding operations and improve hatchery energetics, and hydrothermal liquefaction to produce upgradable biocrude. Outputs from the system include renewable diesel (R100), naphtha, biochar, nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers, and aqueous/solid waste streams. Three different system pathways were explored, yielding a biomass production cost ranging from $210 to $565 per dry metric ton and a minimum fuel selling price from $1.35 to $2.91 per liter of gasoline equivalent. Stochastic manipulation of the process model and sensitivity analyses support these results. The global warming potential analysis shows net greenhouse gas emissions ranging from 14 to 29 gCO(2)-eq MJ(-1), supported by stochastic and sensitivity analyses. The recommendations from this work highlight critical areas for research and development investment such that a sustainable macroalgae cultivation and conversion system can be realized.

AB  - Research into how environmental management practices impact firm performance has largely overlooked the service sector's small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Drawing on industry, resource, and institution-based strategy perspectives, this study investigates how adopting resource efficiency (RE) practices within the framework of a circular economy (CE) supports European service SMEs in achieving carbon neutrality (CN) and reducing production costs (PCs). The study also examines difficulties in adapting to environmental regulations among adopters, their associated impact on performance, and the importance of having a CN strategy. A combined permutation test conducted on 681 European service SMEs from 35 countries revealed--after controlling for sectoral differences--that SMEs without RE practices within the CE framework faced higher PCs, a critical factor for firm performance. Additionally, transportation and storage SMEs with a CN strategy demonstrated greater adoption of RE practices. Implications for theory, practice, and future research are discussed.

AB  - Freezing-thawing in mid-high latitudes is an important factor controlling nutrient dynamics. We transplanted peatland columns (TQ) and freshwater marsh columns (SJ) in different latitudes into south seasonal frozen regions to determine the responses of greenhouse gas emissions from different wetlands to the freezing-thawing under climate warming. The decrease in CO2 and CH4 emissions during freezing stage were interrupted by a short emission peak. While N2O uptake rate reduced with decreasing temperature. In the thawing stage, all the three greenhouse gases exhibited emission peaks. CO2 were 159.83 mg m(-2) h(-1) (TQ) and 86.83 mg m(-2) h(-1) (SJ); CH4 were 1.32 mg m(-2) h(-1) (TQ) and 4.07 mg m(-2) h(-1) (SJ); N2O were 72.14 ug m(-2) h(-1) (TQ) and 22.15 ug m(-2) h(-1) (SJ). Meanwhile, N2O transferred from sink into source. With temperature increase, the emission rate of CO2 increased fast, while CH4 and N2O decreased. CO2 emission during freezing-thawing periods was significantly correlated with soil temperature and CH4 emission. Soil active organic carbon also played important roles in greenhouse gases emissions. Our study suggested that more greenhouse gases may release from wetlands into atmosphere in the context of global warming, and the potential release of CO2 and N2O during freezing-thawing periods was much higher in peatlands of permafrost zone.

AB  - In this study, we assess the greenhouse gas emissions and greenhouse effect potential of a Wuchang bream (Megalobrama amblycephala) aquaculture. We used the 'static opaque chamber-gas chromatography method' to determine in situ emissions of greenhouse gases in the 3-month growing season (CO2, CH4, and N2O) from bream culturing ponds. We detected emissions of all three gases from the ponds, with CO2 emission far exceeding the other gases in the 3-month growing season (CO2 = 278.54 +/- 36.41 g/m(2), CH4 = 23.73 +/- 5.27 g/m(2), and N2O = 1.69 +/- 0.32 g/m(2)). We calculated that in one growing season this ecosystem would have a total emission of CO2 equivalent of 15.86 t CO2/hm(2), indicating its ability to contribute to global warming via the greenhouse effect.

AB  - Over the past decade communities and municipalities have been increasingly switching their recycling systems from dual stream (DS) to single stream (SS). Accordingly, material recovery facilities (MRF) have been constructed and retrofitted in order to accommodate fully commingled input streams. This transition has been driven by a variety of factors, including a general understanding that SS tends to result in increased waste diversion rates for participating communities. This paper examines the greenhouse gas emissions, or "carbon footprint," of recycling systems before and after the transition from DS to SS. This investigation aims to assess the environmental impact of trends in the recycling industry from a holistic perspective. In our analysis we consider several communities around the U.S. on the bases of tonnage and type of material recycled, fuel and electricity consumed in collection and separation, and avoided virgin materials consumption. By examining data from a small range of communities and MRF, we arrive at three main conclusions. First, a change from DS to SS results in approximately a 50% increase in production of recyclable commodities. Second, the net result of the DS-SS transition is approximately 710 kg CO2-equiv. avoided per metric ton of collection. Third, the emissions associated with collection and MRF operation are small in comparison to avoided emissions from avoided consumption of virgin materials. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cities around the world are increasingly expanding their sustainability agendas and adopting urban green and blue infrastructure planning as a strategy to become more resilient, healthy and sustainable. However, the development of urban greening governance often lacks a holistic vision that considers social inequities within the planning, implementation and management of green and blue spaces. Further, gender inequities have been a specific dimension particularly overlooked in urban greening planning, despite gender concerns gaining increasing political relevance in recent years. In this research, we assessed the extento to which social and gender equity are being considered in urban greening plans and projects at the local level. We chose Barcelona (Spain) as main case study due to its pioneering role in implementing crosscutting equity and gender policies at the municipal level. Building on document analysis and semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders, we examined how social justice and gender are understood and operationalized in practice, from the design phase to implementation and maintenance of greening projects. Our findings suggest a shift in the role of urban greening which evolved from an ornamental role to a multifunctional vision of greening and is recently incorporating equity and inclusivity concerns. We identified three action areas of inclusive, gender-sensitive urban green planning practices: first, the incorporation of inclusivity and care as guiding visible values to recognize multiple needs of city residents; second, urban design for different uses and perceptions of greenspaces, particularly in relation to accessibility and autonomy; and third, the awareness and expertise from municipal staff vis-`a-vis the consideration of social and gender equity in green planning and participatory approaches. Finally, we provide practical examples of the strategies that the City of Barcelona is implementing in each area and discuss some challenges and limitations, including what we identify as ad hoc intersectional greening.

AB  - The Greenland ice sheet holds enough water to raise the global sea level with similar to 7 m. Over the last few decades, observations manifest a substantial increase of the mass loss of this ice sheet. Both enhanced melting and increase of the dynamical discharge, associated with calving at the outlet-glacier fronts, are contributing to the mass imbalance. Using a dynamical and thermodynamical ice-sheet model, and taking into account speed up of outlet glaciers, we estimate Greenland's contribution to the 21st-century global sea-level rise and the uncertainty of this estimate. Boundary fields of temperature and precipitation extracted from coupled climate-model projections used for the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, are applied to the ice-sheet model. We implement a simple parameterization for increased flow of outlet glaciers, which decreases the bias of the modeled present-day surface height. It also allows for taking into account the observed recent increase in dynamical discharge, and it can be used for future projections associated with outlet-glacier speed up. Greenland contributes 0-17 cm to global sea-level rise by the end of the 21st century. This range includes the uncertainties in climate-model projections, the uncertainty associated with scenarios of greenhouse-gas emissions, as well as the uncertainties in future outlet-glacier discharge. In addition, the range takes into account the uncertainty of the ice-sheet model and its boundary fields.

AB  - Remote sensing based monitoring of deforestation in the tropics is crucial to better understand global land use change and related changes in ecosystem service provision and to inform governments and civil society on the effectiveness their forest protection policies. In Brazil, deforestation has been closely coupled to the expansion of grazing and cropping systems primarily in the tropical forest, but no spatially explicit high resolution database on deforestation exists that captures tropical forest clearing prior to 2000. The open Landsat archive provides > 45 years of imagery and is well suited for wall-to-wall assessments of historic deforestation dynamics which are valuable to policy development and environmental impact assessments. Image analysis procedures for reconstructing long-term deforestation dynamics over large areas need to cope with regions and time periods for which the archive contains heterogeneous data densities on a yearly and decadal basis. We create for the first time yearly 30 m maps of long term, annual deforestation dynamics (LTAD) covering the period from 1984 to 2014 for Path and Mato Grosso, two Brazilian federal states that cover much of the Brazilian arc-of-deforestation. Our results provide valuable insights into historic deforestation trends, with annually increasing deforestation from 1990 to 1999 for both Para and Mato Grosso. Peak deforestation occurred in 2004 after which deforestation leveled off - with a more pronounced decrease in Mato Grosso than in Path. Contrary to Mato Grosso, Para again experienced increasing annual forest clearing in recent years. For the time period after 2000, we provide an indepth comparison with two widely used products, the Brazilian PRODES and the Global Forest Change maps (GFC, Hansen et al., 2013). Our deforestation estimates (407,000 +/- 42,000 km(2) at 95% confidence level) are above those provided by PRODES, while GFC results are closer to our estimates for the comparison period. Recent PRODES estimates are consistently below our and the GFC results. Overall, our results exemplify the potential of open image archives for multi-decadal, wall-to-wall and fine grain reconstruction of forest change. The presented approach prototypes similar assessments of tropical forest dynamics globally faced with issues of data scarcity.

AB  - The present study provides a detailed review on growth of Indian cement industry, its environmental implications of cement production and its significant influence on the future trajectory of the Indian concrete industry. The Indian cement sector, a vital contributor to the nation's economy, faces a dual challenge of meeting the growing demand for construction materials while mitigating its environmental footprint. The study delves into the industry's current status as the world's second-largest cement producer and its impact on various sectors, including employment, GDP contribution, and dependence on real estate and infrastructure. The paper identifies key obstacles hindering the Indian concrete industry's full potential, such as a slowdown in real estate development, low industrial investment, regulatory changes, and constraints on resource extraction. Despite the industry's promising growth, the looming threats from emerging technologies and increasing environmental concerns, particularly related to greenhouse gas emissions, necessitate a strategic shift towards sustainability. A central focus of the research is the urgent need for the Indian concrete industry to address its environmental impact, specifically the 7% contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions. The study explores the industry's role in creating carbon-neutral concrete by 2050 and emphasizes the importance of collaboration with policymakers, financial institutions like the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and end users in achieving this ambitious goal. The study reveals the comprehensive resource for industry stakeholders, and researchers interested in understanding the environmental implications of cement production and charting a sustainable course for the future of the Indian concrete industry and emerging alternatives.

AB  - This paper provides an overview of the version 11 of the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) Power Data Base, which covers 141 individual countries, 19 composite regions and 76 sectors, reporting data for five reference years - 2004, 2007, 2011, 2014 and 2017. The newly constructed database builds on the previous efforts, introducing several new features and updates. First, by extending the coverage across reference years, GTAP-Power 11 Data Base uses updated levelized costs of electricity generation estimates. Second, the database updates the shares of transmission and distribution costs across countries. Finally, the newly constructed database includes complementary accounts of greenhouse gases and air pollutants. In an application of the database, changes in greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation in each country are decomposed into changes in (1) the amount of electricity generated, (2) the mix of technologies, and (3) the emissions intensity of each technology.

AB  - The global temperature rise necessitates urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with Geological Carbon Storage (GCS) emerging as a promising strategy. GCS involves injecting CO2 into deep geological formations, particularly saline aquifers. However, ideal reservoir conditions, such as stable caprock and adequate storage capacity, are rare in regions like Switzerland. This study assesses the CO2 storage potential in the saline aquifer at Triemli, Switzerland, aiming to explore the feasibility of decentralized, small to medium-scale storage with multiple injection points in geologically unfavorable areas. Through numerical simulations, we investigate CO2 injection, migration, and long-term reservoir stability, bridging the gap between theoretical estimates and practical feasibility. Our findings highlight the potential of deep saline aquifers in the Swiss Molasse Basin and Folded Jura for CO2 storage, with the study area capable of storing approximately 2 million tons of CO2 over 30 years. Advanced injection techniques could increase this capacity to 3 million tons. These results underscore the importance of reservoir properties in optimizing CO2 storage and provide crucial insights for guiding future GCS efforts in Switzerland and beyond, supporting informed decision-making and the implementation of decentralized storage projects.

AB  - Background Heatwaves are a critical public health problem. There will be an increase in the frequency and severity of heatwaves under changing climate. However, evidence about the impacts of climate change on heatwave-related mortality at a global scale is limited. Methods and findings We collected historical daily time series of mean temperature and mortality for all causes or non-external causes, in periods ranging from January 1, 1984, to December 31, 2015, in 412 communities within 20 countries/regions. We estimated heatwave +/- mortality associations through a two-stage time series design. Current and future daily mean temperature series were projected under four scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions from 1971 +/- 2099, with five general circulation models. We projected excess mortality in relation to heatwaves in the future under each scenario of greenhouse gas emissions, with two assumptions for adaptation (no adaptation and hypothetical adaptation) and three scenarios of population change (high variant, median variant, and low variant). Results show that, if there is no adaptation, heatwave-related excess mortality is expected to increase the most in tropical and subtropical countries/regions (close to the equator), while European countries and the United States will have smaller percent increases in heatwave-related excess mortality. The higher the population variant and the greenhouse gas emissions, the higher the increase of heatwave-related excess mortality in the future. The changes in 2031 +/- 2080 compared with 1971 +/- 2020 range from approximately 2,000% in Colombia to 150% in Moldova under the highest emission scenario and high-variant population scenario, without any adaptation. If we considered hypothetical adaptation to future climate, under high-variant population scenario and all scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions, the heatwave-related excess mortality is expected to still increase across all the countries/regions except Moldova and Japan. However, the increase would be much smaller than the no adaptation scenario. The simple assumptions with respect to adaptation as follows: no adaptation and hypothetical adaptation results in some uncertainties of projections. Conclusions This study provides a comprehensive characterisation of future heatwave-related excess mortality across various regions and under alternative scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions, different assumptions of adaptation, and different scenarios of population change. The projections can help decision makers in planning adaptation and mitigation strategies for climate change.

AB  - Biochar is relatively well understood as a soil enhancement. Recently, it has been explored as a construction material. While works had been conducted on deploying biochar for road construction, there is an emerging trend of using biochar as concrete admixture. In comparison, using biochar this way will reduce more greenhouse gas emissions than if carbon is captured and sequestered through mineralization and deployment in construction. The use of biochar-containing construction materials to capture and then lock atmospheric carbon dioxide in buildings and structures can potentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an additional 25%. In this review, attention was focused on evaluating biochar's capability for carbon adsorption, which depends on factors such as pyrolysis conditions (specifically, pyrolysis temperature, heating rate, and pressure) and activation methods (and without surface modification). Gaps in the current literature were identified and important areas for future research proposed. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Enhancing carbon sequestration in Portland cement-based foamed mortar is a potential means to reduce carbon emissions associated with lightweight building components. This research aims to investigate the influence of biochar, prepared from wood waste, in enhancing carbon sequestration in foamed mortar of three target densities - 1150 kg/m(3) and 1300 kg/m(3) and 1450 kg/m(3) respectively through accelerated carbonation (CO2 concentration of 2%) technique. Effect of biochar on rheology, and influence of carbonation on micro-structure, compressive strength, water absorption and shrinkage are investigated. Based on thermogravimetry analysis, carbon dioxide uptake of 26.80% and 30% by mass of cement are achieved in foamed mortar containing biochar, silica fume and fly ash after 7 days and 28 days respectively, which is higher by 3% compared to control (without biochar). Adding biochar to replace 3% by mass of fly ash (density of 1150 kg/m(3)) and 20% by mass of silica fume (density 1450 kg/m(3)) improves the workability of foamed mortar mixtures, evident from the 32% and 44% reduction in yield stress up to 35 min from the time of wet mixing. For density groups of 1300 kg/m(3) and 1450 kg/m(3), addition of biochar reduces water-accessible porosity by 2 - 3%, leading to 17% and 23% higher compressive strength compared to the controls after 28 days of water curing. After carbonation biochar-foamed mortars retain 20-38% higher strength than the respective controls, although reduction in strength by 40 - 60% compared to water curing is observed, ascribed to degradation of hydration products during prolonged carbonation. Addition of biochar results in 10-12% higher shrinkage under an air-drying regime, while it reduces chemical shrinkage associated with carbonation by 15-20% than control. Overall, this study demonstrates a promising potential for developing biochar-enhanced low-carbon lightweight building products.

AB  - Two kinds of local low-carbon initiatives are the focus in this paper: those initiated under the umbrella of a central government program, and those initiated from below by individuals and municipalities in Sweden. The project studied in the first category was focused on eco-technological innovations undertaken by a municipal housing company. The case in the second category was a dialogue-based program with selected citizens willing to test a climate-friendly lifestyle. The latter approach faced strong barriers when going from words to deeds, lacking the large-scale favors of massive eco-technological investments. Highlighting one particular project in each category, we illustrate the potentials and barriers of each approach. It is concluded that policymakers have to find ways to combine the two, otherwise there is a risk that low-carbon committed individuals will become disillusioned or that eco-technological gains will be spoiled by rebound consumption.

AB  - Guyana, a small oft-forgotten country in South America, has seen its prospects shift markedly in recent years. Previously lauded as a world leader in environmental conservation and avoided deforestation initiatives, Guyana recently made international headlines when significant oil discoveries were made in its territorial waters. Using a model of convergence, stasis and reverberation, this article positions these developments historically and politically. In it, I argue that Guyana's shifting fortunes are reflective of broader regional and international shifts and contestations around post-colonial development and climate policy. The article shows how different forms of vulnerability coalesced over time to position Guyana as both vulnerable and as agential. The state's vulnerability lies in its susceptibility to natural disasters through climate change, imperialism in the wake of colonialism, and ethnic strife through race-based politics. Its agency, on the other hand, lies in its deployment of its natural resources and its geographic location to negotiate changing geo-political arrangements and efforts to address climate change. In developing this argument, the article views, and positions Guyana as a microcosm of several pressing and overlapping global crises - a metaphorical eye of the storm.

AB  - In order to accomplish significant primary energy saving and GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions reduction, CHP (combined heat and power) technology can be adopted largely for industrial and civil sectors. Waiting for the cutting-edge appliances (i.e. Fuel Cell) wide deployment, ICEs (internal combustion engines) fuelled with an environmentally-friendly fuel, such as H(2)NG (hydrogen-natural gas mixtures) could represent the bridge technology towards the forthcoming pure hydrogen economy. This paper deals with the results of an experimental campaign carried out on a Single Cylinder ICE, fuelled with NG (natural gas) and H(2)NG @ 15% vol. In detail, energy performances were assessed at rated and partial loads. From data analysis, it emerged that the electrical efficiency increased up to 2.28%, at the expense of the heat recovery one, having added hydrogen. Additionally, due to the higher water content in exhaust gas when H(2)NG is burned, it was investigated on how heat recovery efficiency has been affected by condensing operating conditions. Finally, to estimate this benefit, an expeditious procedure was developed building three maps for H(2)NG blends condensing properties from 0% up to 30% vol. of H-2. Their outputs provided the condensation efficiency value and the absolute gain of heat recovery one with varying exhaust gas temperatures and hydrogen fraction in the mixture. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Brazil has a high diversity of primates, but increasing anthropogenic pressures and climate change could influence forest cover in the country and cause future changes in the distribution of primate populations. Here we aim to assess the long-term suitability of habitats for the conservation of three threatened Brazilian primates (Alouatta belzebul, Sapajus flavius and Sapajus libidinosus) through (1) estimating their current and future distributions using species distribution models, (2) evaluating how much of the areas projected to be suitable is represented within protected areas and priority areas for biodiversity conservation, and (3) assessing the extent of remaining forest cover in areas predicted to be suitable for these species. We found that 88% of the suitable areas are outside protected areas and only 24% are located in areas with forest cover. Although not within protected areas, 27% of the climatically suitable areas are considered priority areas for conservation. Future projections, considering a severe climate change scenario, indicate that A. belzebul, S. flavius and S. libidinosus may lose up to 94, 98 and 54% of their suitable range, respectively. The establishment of primate populations and their long-term survival in these areas are at risk. Mitigation actions such as the implementation of new protected areas, forest restoration and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions will be essential for the conservation of Brazilian primates.

AB  - To reduce the costs of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the Kyoto protocol, international trades of emissions quotas are allowed. The revenue from the sale of quotas may exceed the sanctions for non-compliance if these penalties are weak or poorly enforced. Under these circumstances emissions trading enables a country to benefit financially through non-compliance. To counter non-compliance due to trading a range of liability proposals have been suggested. Using a simple global model, we analyze the economic and environmental performance of these proposals for the first commitment period. In addition, the proposals are tested for their sensitivity to national circumstances and to market power. We find that penalties are sufficient to deter non-compliance if they are high enough and are effectively enforced. If the non-compliance penalties are weak or poorly enforced, the permanent reserve proposal is best able to ensure compliance by sellers at a cost similar to the competitive market equilibrium. While not sufficient to ensure compliance on their own, eligibility requirements and annual retirement of AAUs equal to actual emissions contribute to compliance at little or no cost. Hence, such provisions could complement other liability proposals.

AB  - Current methods for monitoring deforestation from satellite data at sub-annual scales require pixel time series to have many historical observations in the reference period to model normal forest dynamics before detecting deforestation. However, in some areas, pixel time series often do not have many historical observations. Detecting deforestation at a pixel with scarce historical observations can be improved by complementing the pixel time series with spatial context information. In this work, we propose a data-driven space-time change detection method that detects deforestation events at sub-annual scales in data cubes of satellite image time series. First we spatially normalised observations in the local space-time data cube to reduce seasonality. Subsequently, we detected deforestation by assessing whether a newly acquired observation in the monitoring period is an extreme when compared against spatially normalised values in a local space-time data cube defined over reference period. We demonstrated our method at two sites, a dry tropical Bolivian forest and a humid tropical Brazilian forest, by varying the spatial and temporal extent of data cube. We emulated a "near real-time" monitoring scenario, implying that observations in the monitoring period were sequentially rather than simultaneously assessed for deforestation. Using Landsat normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series, we achieved a median temporal detection delay of less than three observations, a producer's accuracy above 70%, a user's accuracy above 65%, and an overall accuracy above 80% at both sites, even when the reference period of the data cube only contained one year of data. Our results also show that large percentile thresholds (e.g., 5th percentile) achieve higher producer's accuracy and shorter temporal detection delay, whereas smaller percentiles (e.g., 0.1 percentile) achieve higher user's accuracy, but longer temporal detection delay. The method is data-driven, not based on statistical assumption on the data distribution, and can be applied on different forest types. However, it may face challenges in mixed forests where, for example, deciduous and evergreen forests coexist within short distances. A pixel to be assessed for deforestation should have a minimum of three temporal observations, the first of which must be known to represent forest. Such short time series allow rapid deployment of newly launched sensors (e.g., Sentinel-2) for detecting deforestation events at sub-annual scales.

This study identified important green skill areas in relation to building energy efficiency that are suitable for inclusion in the Building Construction Programme (BCP) at universities for the attainment of environmental sustainability. A questionnaire was used with 308 respondents. Data analyses were carried out using Descriptive Statistics, Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). The supremacy of the identified energy efficiency skills over the non-energy efficiency skills is confirmed as its integration into BCP helps in realising environmental sustainability. Findings include the important areas to be included into the building construction programme curriculum. Findings can be used by the government for the adoption and practical implementation of these findings.

AB  - Happiness studies generally investigate average levels of happiness rather than happiness inequality between regions, and studies of social inequality usually measure it based on the distribution of life opportunities (e.g., income) rather than life results (e.g., happiness). Inspired by the Kuznets curve, which illustrates the inverted U-shaped correlation between income inequality and economic growth, this study investigates whether there is a subjective wellbeing Kuznets curve. It uses data from ten waves of the Chinese General Social Survey to construct a panel data set and runs panel data models to investigate the hypothesized curvilinear relationship between happiness inequality and economic growth. The results show that happiness inequality, measured as the standard deviations of respondents' self-reported happiness, first increases and then decreases as per-capita GDP increases in Chinese provinces. These findings strongly support the subjective wellbeing Kuznets curve hypothesis and suggest that strategies for reducing happiness inequality must consider stages of economic development.

AB  - Ferroalloys are defined as iron-bearing alloys with a high proportion of one or more other elements manganese, chromium, silicon, molybdenum, etc., mainly used by the iron and steel industries. Life cycle assessment methodology was used to estimate the greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint of a number of these ferroalloy production processes. The results of the study showed that GHG footprint for ferroalloy production in Australia was 1.8 t CO(2)e/t FeMn, 2.8 t CO(2)e/t SiMn and 3.4 t CO(2)e/t FeSi alloy metal. These results compare with GHG footprints for ferronickel and ferrochromium of 13.9 t CO(2)e/t and 3.0 t CO(2)e/t, respectively revised from an earlier study. These GHG footprint estimates were calculated using the Tasmanian electricity greenhouse gas emission factor since these ferroalloy industries are located in Tasmania, Australia. The major difference in greenhouse gas emissions between the various ferroalloys is largely due to their respective amounts of electricity use and coke/coal consumption. These results are not too different to the results from a limited number of studies reported in the literature when compared on a similar electricity source basis. The LCA results also showed that coke and coal usage contributed close to 60% or more of the total GHG emissions from the various ferroalloy production processes. In light of this finding, there would appear to be an opportunity to reduce GHG emissions from ferroalloy production if fossil fuel-based coal is replaced with biomass based renewable carbon.

AB  - As the focus of climate policy shifts from pledges to implementation, there is a growing need to track progress on climate change mitigation at the country level, particularly for the land-use sector. Despite new tools and models providing unprecedented monitoring opportunities, striking differences remain in estimations of anthropogenic land-use CO2 fluxes between, on the one hand, the national greenhouse gas inventories (NGHGIs) used to assess compliance with national climate targets under the Paris Agreement and, on the other hand, the Global Carbon Budget and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment reports, both based on global bookkeeping models (BMs). Recent studies have shown that these differences are mainly due to inconsistent definitions of anthropogenic CO(2 )fluxes in managed forests. Countries assume larger areas of forest to be managed than BMs do, due to a broader definition of managed land in NGHGIs. Additionally, the fraction of the land sink caused by indirect effects of human-induced environmental change (e.g. fertilisation effect on vegetation growth due to increased atmospheric CO2 concentration) on managed lands is treated as non-anthropogenic by BMs but as anthropogenic in most NGHGIs. We implement an approach that adds the CO2 sink caused by environmental change in countries' managed forests (estimated by 16 dynamic global vegetation models, DGVMs) to the land-use fluxes from three BMs. This sum is conceptually more comparable to NGHGIs and is thus expected to be quantitatively more similar. Our analysis uses updated and more comprehensive data from NGHGIs than previous studies and provides model results at a greater level of disaggregation in terms of regions, countries and land categories (i.e. forest land, deforestation, organic soils, other land uses). Our results confirm a large difference (6.7 GtCO2 yr(-1)) in global land-use CO2 fluxes between the ensemble mean of the BMs, which estimate a source of 4.8 GtCO(2) yr(-1) for the period 2000-2020, and NGHGIs, which estimate a sink of -1.9 GtCO(2) yr(-1) in the same period. Most of the gap is found on forest land (3.5 GtCO(2) yr(-1)), with differences also for deforestation (2.4 GtCO(2) yr(-1)), for fluxes from other land uses (1.0 GtCO(2) yr(-1)) and to a lesser extent for fluxes from organic soils (0.2 GtCO(2) yr(-1)). By adding the DGVM ensemble mean sink arising from environmental change in managed forests (-6.4 GtCO(2) yr(-1)) to BM estimates, the gap between BMs and NGHGIs becomes substantially smaller both globally (residual gap: 0.3 GtCO(2) yr(-1)) and in most regions and countries. However, some discrepancies remain and deserve further investigation. For example, the BMs generally provide higher emissions from deforestation than NGHGIs and, when adjusted with the sink in managed forests estimated by DGVMs, yield a sink that is often greater than NGHGIs. In summary, this study provides a blueprint for harmonising the estimations of anthropogenic land-use fluxes, allowing for detailed comparisons between global models and national inventories at global, regional and country levels. This is crucial to increase confidence in land-use emissions estimates, support investments in land-based mitigation strategies and assess the countries' collective progress under the Global Stocktake of the Paris Agreement.

AB  - Climate change can have a serious impact on human life and occurs due to the emission of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere. Deforestation is one contributing factor to climate change. It is important to understand the drivers of deforestation for mitigation efforts, but there is a lack of data-driven studies that can predict these drivers. In this work, we propose a contrastive learning architecture, called Multimodal SuperCon, to classify the drivers of deforestation in Indonesia using composite images obtained from Landsat 8. Multimodal SuperCon is an architecture that combines contrastive learning and multimodal fusion to handle the available Indonesian deforestation dataset. As a means to yield better performance, Multimodal SuperCon upgrades ordinary SuperCon so that it is able to handle auxiliary spatial variables as additional inputs. Our proposed model outperforms previous work on driver classification, giving an 8% improvement in accuracy compared to a state-of-the-art rotation equivariant model for the same task.

AB  - Water scarcity threatens the well-being of individuals, the natural environment, and economic systems that function within society. Faced with growing and evolving water supply concerns, many utilities and industries have relied on nontraditional water sources to mitigate severe shortages and combat water quality concerns. Treated municipal wastewater can serve as a reliable supply of water at a predictable quality and quantity and is especially well-suited for nonpotable end uses. In this work, we identify areas within the contiguous United States where water reuse projects are possible on the basis of existing supplies of treated wastewater at known qualities and quantities, estimated nonpotable demands, and state-level policies that outline water quality requirements for reuse. We use publicly available data to develop a geographic information system-based supply-demand assessment that identifies spatial trends and areas of interest for locally focused water reuse analysis. We find that the feasibility of water reuse is highly sensitive to existing state-level policies and the level of wastewater treatment currently in place. Nonpotable recycled water can potentially offset significant water withdrawals within communities where specific policy and technical criteria are met.

AB  - This article draws attention to the basic reflections related to new technologies as they are presented in key policy documents in Norway. One of the primary aims is to throw light on some of the dilemmas associated with the pedagogical use of technological innovations. This applies not least to the substantial discrepancy between expectations and results that has also been shown internationally. The most important conclusion in the article is that the investment in new technologies seems to have been founded on misleading premises. The documents analysed are characterized by one-sided pupil and learning perspectives in which teachers and pedagogical craftsmanship have been sidelined. Pedagogical reflections have come to be replaced by diffuse political visions that have left the field almost wide open to the technological enthusiast. Computers have increasingly been perceived as a contribution to efficiency and simplification. The industrial society's view of technology has thus been perpetuated. The prevailing descriptions have failed to assimilate the changed role of technology in our society. New technological solutions can help to simplify both teaching and learning but at the same time they lead to increased complexity. The latter point is not mentioned in the planning documents. The difficult, challenging and often contradictory factors are afforded no place. As a result, the plans have shortcomings and are incapable of meeting the challenges of the new school day.

AB  - In order to provide more scientific guidance for wetland bird protection, this study addressed the dynamics of the bird community sorted by ecotypes, classifications and threat categories from 2015 to 2019, and non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis, generalized additive models and the Mantel test were used to examine the relationships between bird communities and habitat types. The results showed that: (1) The abundance of birds peaked in 2017 at 88,258 individuals and then declined. Moreover, there was an inverse trend between species richness and abundance of birds, meaning greater abundance is associated with fewer species. (2) Swimming birds were dominant ecotypes and Anseriformes possessed the highest abundance. It was noteworthy that the abundance of critically endangered birds (Aythya baeri and Grus leucogeranus) and the species richness of endangered birds increased. (3) Building land and farmland had dominant impacts on the composition of bird community. Wading birds and birds in Gruiformes were significantly impacted by building land and farmland, and near threatened species were substantially influenced by farmland. Therefore, maintaining good connectivity between protected areas and surrounding areas is one of the best ways to effectively manage biodiversity of the target area. This research may provide a broader insight for coastal wetland bird habitat management and bird diversity preservation.

AB  - Sustainability of the built environment is an increasingly prominent concern in academic and policy discussions in the UK and EU. Initiatives such as the Code for Sustainable Homes in the UK have been developed to aid integration of sustainability principles into housing developments. Primary focus in this field has been largely on environmental sustainability (particularly energy efficiency) with less attention paid to social and economic factors. This article argues that health and well-being issues need greater consideration within current sustainable housing policy and developments. Three key reasons are presented in support of this argument: (i) Creation of greater market demand; public demand for sustainable buildings could be enhanced through greater promotion of the health and well-being benefits of sustainable housing: (ii) Time-scales; given the longevity of buildings, health considerations should be of paramount importance to avoid any possible future adverse effects: (iii) Indirect societal benefits; enhanced health and well-being can lead to wider societal and economic benefits such as lower healthcare costs. The paper then presents some of the seminal findings from health and housing literature review, outlining how these can be used to enhance sustainable housing policy and developments. The paper concludes by presenting the next stages of research.

AB  - This study evaluated the relationships between metal pollution and carbon production at six sites along a 285 km length of the Ganga River. Metal contaminated sites did show a significant reduction in microbial biomass, substrate induced respiration, fluorescein diacetate hydrolytic assay (FDAase) and beta-d-glucosidase. Concordantly, despite a high concentration of total organic carbon at these sites, CO2 emission at the land-water interface remained low. We found a strong positive correlation between CO2 emission and TOC (r = 0.92; p < 0.001). However, this relationship weakens when the sum of total heavy metal ( n-ary sumation THM) exceed 400 mu g g(-1). Also, CO2 emission did show a positive correlation (r = 0.85; p < 0.001) with FDAase. The study shows that metal accumulation in riverbed sediment could potentially lead to better carbon sequestration on account of reduced microbial/enzyme activities. This carries significance for riverine carbon budget and modeling.

AB  - Globalization is often associated with deforestation, but its impacts on forest recovery are less known. We analyzed socioeconomic data, land-use surveys, and satellite imagery to monitor changes in woody cover in El Salvador from the early 1990s to the presen't. Even where rural population density exceeded 250 people per square kilometer, we documented a 22% increase in the area with more than 30% tree cover, and a 7% increase in the area with more than 60% tree cover. Woodland resurgence reflected processes including civil war, retraction of the agricultural frontier, and international migration and associated remittances. Agrarian reform, structural adjustment, and emerging environmental ideas also played a role in woodland dynamics. Remittances may be especially important for woodland recovery in El Salvador, enabling people in rural areas to buy food without all of them needing to grow and sell it. This study adds to our understanding of the complexity of land-use change in emerging globalized economies and of potential conservation approaches for inhabited landscapes.

AB  - Nickel is one of the main industrial metals and an essential element for the energy transition towards renewable sources. The metal is increasingly sourced from surficial laterite-type deposits, especially in Indonesia where large investments have been made in its mining and processing infrastructure. The direct land use and land cover (dLUC) change associated with this kind of mine development is not accurately known, although this parameter plays an important role as a master variable in modelling of various environmental effects such as impacts on biodiversity, water quality and greenhouse gas emissions. We have measured the growth of the total land occupied by the booming Indonesian nickel industry over the last two decades and have linked the obtained dLUC change to the country's declared ore production. Our methodology is based on simple visual interpretation of mine areas using Google Earth Pro, allowing for easy verification. The analysis indicates a land transformation factor of 0.7 +/- 0.1 m2 per ton of nickel ore, which is up to 20 times larger than previous estimates. Our revision of this factor might be of importance in discussions about the socio-ecological impact of nickel mining in Indonesia and for management policies designed to mitigate its consequences.

AB  - Social sustainability is gaining importance in the international urban development context; however, in India, the concept is unclear and under-represented. New approaches and tools at the level of urban policy, design and implementation are highly biased towards environmental sustainability focussing on "smart" technological innovations. This scant focus, coupled with massive and inequitable urban growth, is resulting in social crises that not only pose danger to the country's stability but also represent some of the fundamental challenges to its sustainable future. Based on a detailed review of the literature on social sustainability, this paper explores its meaning and sets out its core components. It calls for humanising Indian cities and argues that a more comprehensive approach to the constituent but neglected "social" dimension of sustainable development which goes beyond the technical aspects of solving infrastructure-focused social issues to creating built environments that nurture strong urban communities is necessary. Analytical findings are translated into the social sustainability framework, which suggests a combination of (micro-level variables of) bottom-up and (macro-level variables of) top-down approaches in its implementation, because nurturing social sustainability in cities needs both, planned context and emergent actions.

AB  - This paper explores the trade-offs between four different aspects of European workers' life satisfaction (satisfaction with education, the present work, family life and social life), to reach balanced optimal levels across these features. This analysis was performed separately for different profiles of workers, i.e. full-time and part-time workers in 34 different European countries, differentiated by gender. The methodology employed for this purpose couples econometric and multiobjective interval programming approaches, enabling to assess the compromises of specific aspects of workers' personal and working conditions. Our findings indicate that current full-time working environments do not enable to foster higher levels of workers' life satisfaction with more than one child. Moreover, full-time (unlike part-time) working activities allow reaching worse levels across all measures of life satisfaction under analysis in a best-case scenario. This outcome suggests a change of paradigm where workers are keen on sacrificing other aspects of life satisfaction (namely their earnings and benefits) if this means having a better compromise of their personal and working lives. It is clear that promoting one-sided policies that only account for workers' satisfaction with their jobs and careers, without explicitly encompassing family values, affects fertility rates and population ageing, raising awareness of the importance of family work in policy-making.

AB  - Background Increasing health expenditure in low-income countries is associated with rapid gains in health status. Less attention has been paid to the possibility of diminishing marginal returns to health expenditure at high levels of spending, or to the relationship between health-care greenhouse gas emissions and outcomes. Our study aimed to investigate the existence, scale, and implications of diminishing marginal returns to health-care expenditure and emissions. Methods Segmented (piecewise) regression analysis was used to explore the relationship between two measures of health outcome from the Global Burden of Disease project (mortality amenable to health care [MAH] and health-adjusted life expectancy [HALE]), four aggregates of health expenditure per capita from the WHO Global Health Expenditure Database, and health-care sector greenhouse gas emissions per capita derived from a 2020 study by Lenzen and colleagues. Turning point knots-points at which the elasticity or velocity of increasing returns to expenditure and emissions changed substantially-were estimated and countries in the vicinity of these knots identified. Findings Rapidly increasing returns (improvements in population health as measured by MAH and HALE) to health expenditure were estimated in low-income and lower-middle-income countries; at levels of spending above approximately US$500 per capita, these returns start to slow. At levels of spending above those seen in high-income countries such as Italy (approximately US$3400), there is little or no evidence of further health returns to additional spending or to increasing health-care greenhouse gas emissions. Interpretation Dramatic improvements in population health outcomes could be achieved by additional investment in health expenditure in low-income countries. Conversely, continuing growth in health expenditure in high-income countries will, by itself, be unlikely to yield rapid improvements in health outcomes. Our findings inform the emerging debate on the importance of sufficiency within planetary boundaries-low-income countries need rapid growth in health expenditure, whereas high-income countries could potentially achieve better health outcomes at substantially lower levels of resource use.

AB  - Increased penetration of low-carbon energy technologies, such as wind and solar, into the U.S. energy system has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, facilitate transmission of energy to remote regions, and increase opportunities for public participation in energy system change. It also offers a window of opportunity to observe the social dynamics of rapid socio-technical system change. Studying internal, yet informal, communication among energy professionals enables communication researchers to probe processes and practices of identity composition, which may, in turn, suggest opportunities to shift the relationship between energy professionals and energy consumers away from alienation and toward consubstantiation. With this goal in mind, we analyzed communication among U.S. offshore wind professionals-specifically energy scientists and engineers-at professional conferences. Textual analysis of conference presentations and ethnographic interviews indicates that scientists and engineers working with the nascent U.S. offshore wind industry are composing an identity inspired by the frontier myth. We suggest that these evocations of the frontier myth might be strategically used to cultivate consubstantiality between technically-oriented energy professionals and publics. Awareness of a common connection to frontier myth may contribute to public engagement with offshore wind energy specifically, and more generally, with low-carbon energy technologies.

AB  - Racial environmental inequities, documented in research over the past ten years, have deep cultural sources in the connections between the concept of social pollution as it has operated in U.S. race relations and the pollution of minority communities, both of which are, in part, the expression of our dominant cultural ethic and project of mastering nature. The project of mastering nature requires the disciplining of ''human nature'' in a context of social power in order to dominate ''outward'' or ''external'' nature for the purposes of production and consumption. In disciplining human nature, our ethics and practices of work and gender have fostered the repression and projection of sensuality, widely construed, onto African-Americans in particular. This racial ''other'' has been historically segregated in our society through social pollution taboos. Social pollution practices, in turn, facilitate the disproportionate environmental pollution of minority communities by rendering such pollution, like the communities themselves, less visible and therefore less of a threat to white centers of power. This fit between social and environmental pollution is expressed in the notion of ''appropriately polluted space.'' Attempts to understand and correct racial environmental inequities will founder unless these deeper cultural connections are recognized and challenged. Moreover, attempts to redefine an environmentally benign ''self'' in the American context require that the historical ''other'' of race be confronted and transcended.

AB  - This paper aims to contribute to recent sociological debates about gendered identity constructions and formations, and gendered citizenship, by exploring gender transformation through an analysis of new femininities and masculinities as they are variously articulated by transgender women and men. The paper charts the ways in which transgender has emerged as a subject of increasing social and cultural interest in recent years. Shifting attitudes towards transgender people are also evident through recent legislative changes brought by the Gender Recognition Act ( 2005). These social, cultural and legislative developments reflect the ways in which gender diversity is acquiring visibility in contemporary society, and suggest that gender diverse people themselves are experiencing greater levels of social inclusion. Such developments mark transgender as an important and timely area of sociological study. The paper argues that while the Gender Recognition Act marks a significant shift in socio- legal understandings of 'gender' as distinct from ' sex', it problematically remains tied to a medical perspective of transgender that continues to marginalise practices of gender diversity. The paper thus proposes caution against an assured trajectory of ( trans) gender transformation and social change. Rather, normative binary understandings of ' gender' underpin recent social and legislative shifts, giving way to individual and collective tensions around the desirability of assimilation. In turn these issues produce divergent ways of living as ' new' women and men.

AB  - Global biodiversity declines and concomitant increases in diseases and calamities indicate the need for well-founded measures to provide sustainable development, guaranteeing material progress and social welfare, while safeguarding biodiversity. Public policies are important in this context as they provide norms for actions to deal with economic and socio-ecological problems. Nevertheless, scientists and legislators have conflicting opinions; perhaps due to lack of knowledge on both sides. Scientists provide information that is never used by legislators and legislators provide laws that do not provide biodiversity protection. Review and understanding of local legislation are thus crucial to understand those relationships and to provide robust suggestions for change. Here, we review Brazilian legislation concerning pollinator-relevant policies to show how these subnational policies fit calls from the science community. We also compared Brazilian legislation related to pollinator and biome protection to legislation in other countries. We found 314 national, state, and municipal laws on apiculture, meliponiculture, economic incentives, pesticides, pollinator awareness, and city planning. Although scientists are producing high-quality science to provide information for legislative standards, that information is not being used. Brazilian policies are numerous, but, in general, lack the standards to provide sustainable conservation. The main flaws are related to the lack of knowledge about non-bee pollinators, integrated pest management and GM crop risks, and lack of long-term monitoring of pollinators and pollination. More comprehensive and interdisciplinary legislation is needed to accomplish crop and biodiversity protection. Brazilian scientists should be consulted more often and participate in proposals for laws relating to pollinator conservation. (C) 2021 Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecologica e Conservacao.

AB  - This study analyzes Brazil's tobacco control policy from 1986 to 2016, seeking to describe the policy's history and discuss its achievements, limits, and challenges. The study adopted a political economics approach and contributions from public policy analysis. Data were based on a search of the literature, documents, and secondary sources and semi-structured interviews with stakeholders involved in the policy. Factors related to the domestic and international contexts, the political process, and the policy's content influenced the institutional characteristics of tobacco control in the country. The study emphasizes the consolidation of Brazil's social rejection of smoking, government structuring of the policy, action by civil society, and Brazil's prestige in the international scenario. Intersector tobacco control measures like price and tax increases on cigarettes, the promotion of smoke-free environments, and the enforcement of health warnings contributed to the important reduction in prevalence of smoking. Implementation of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in Brazil, beginning in 2006, contributed to the expansion and consolidation of the national policy. However, tobacco-related economic interests limited the implementation of some strategic measures. The challenges feature the medium-and long-term sustainability of tobacco control and the solution to barriers involving crop diversification on current tobacco-growing areas, the fight against the illegal cigarette trade, and interference in the policy by the tobacco industry.

AB  - The study assesses the extent to which public health is integrated into European national and urban climate change adaptation policy and planning. We analyse national adaptation documents from the 27 European Union member states and interview city-level experts (n = 17) on the integration of three categories of adaptation efforts: general efforts to minimize health impacts related to climate change, targeted efforts to enhance resilience in health systems, and supportive efforts to foster the potential of the first two categories. At a national level, general efforts to address vector-borne diseases and heat-related illness are covered comprehensively, whereas efforts addressing several climate-related health risks are neglected (e.g. water-borne diseases, injuries from extreme weather and cardiopulmonary health) or overlooked (e.g. malnutrition and mental health). Targeted efforts to inform policy decisions, such as carrying out research, risk monitoring and assessments, are often described in detail, but efforts to manage day-to-day health care delivery and emergency situations receive little attention. At the urban level, health issues receive less attention in climate adaptation policy and planning. If health topics are included, they are often described as indirect benefits of adaptation efforts in other sectors and not perceived as the priority of the involved authorities. This effectively means that general and targeted efforts are the responsibility of other sectoral departments, while supportive efforts are the responsibility of the national government or external organizations. As a result, at an urban level, climate-related health system adaptation is not a policy aim in its own right, and many potentially high health risks are being ignored. In order for health risks to be better integrated into adaptation policy and planning, it is critical to interconnect national and urban levels, reduce sectoral thinking and welcome external expertize and facilitate large-scale data collection and sharing of health and climate indicators.Key policy insightsWe recommend focussing on cooperatively drafting strategies for integrating health issues into climate policy and planning with stakeholders at the national and urban levels, in different policy sectors and in society.Policy planners can build on the strengths of adaptation documents from other countries or cities and take note of any weaknesses.We advocate to foster co-benefits for health and climate action of various adaptation measures (e.g. by promoting active mobility and urban greenery, health impacts related to heat, (mental and physical) stress and air pollution are reduced).Large-scale data collection and sharing of health and climate indicators should be facilitated to support learning and pro-active decision-making.

AB  - Society is at a critical juncture in its relationship with the natural environment, a relationship in which tourism has growing significance. Yet, twenty years after the Brundtland Report, environmental policy has to date had little influence upon the workings of the tourism market, the supply and demand elements of which determine the 'use' or 'non-use' of nature. Inherent to the market is its environment ethic, that is, the extent of our recognition of nature's rights to existence. The thesis of this article is that whilst environmental policy may possibly have a greater influence in the future, it is the environmental ethics of the market that will be deterministic to the balance of the tourism-environment relationship.

AB  - Environmental regulations on mercury (Hg) emissions and associated ecosystem restoration are closely linked to what Hg levels we consider natural. It is widely accepted that atmospheric Hg deposition has increased by a factor 3 +/- 1 since pre-industrial times. However, no long-term historical records of actual atmospheric gaseous elemental Hg (GEM) concentrations exist. In this study we report Hg stable isotope signatures in Pyrenean peat records (southwestern Europe) that are used as tracers of Hg deposition pathway (Delta Hg-200, wet vs dry Hg deposition) and atmospheric Hg sources and cycling (delta Hg-202, Delta Hg-199). By anchoring peat-derived GEM dry deposition to modern atmospheric GEM levels we are able to reconstruct the first millennial-scale atmospheric GEM concentration record. Reconstructed GEM levels from 1970-2010 agree with monitoring data, and maximum 20th Century GEM levels of 3.9 +/- 0.5 ng m(-3) were 15 +/- 4 times the natural Holocene background of 0.27 +/- 0.11 ng m(-3). We suggest that a -0.7 parts per thousand shift in delta Hg-202 during the medieval and Renaissance periods is caused by deforestation and associated biomass burning Hg emissions. Our findings suggest therefore that human impacts on the global mercury cycle are subtler and substantially larger than currently thought.

AB  - Background The dual crises of climate change and chronic, or non-communicable, disease (NCD) have emerged worldwide as the global economy has industrialized over the past two centuries. Aims In this synthesis I examine humans' dependence on external (non-metabolic) energy expenditure (e.g., fire, fossil fuels) as a common, root cause in these modern crises. Materials and Methods Using fossil, archeological, and historical evidence I show that the human lineage has been dependent on external energy sources since the control of fire in the Paleolithic. This reliance has grown with the development of agriculture, the use of wind- and water-power, and the most recently with industrialization and the transition to fossil fuels. To place industrialization in context I develop a Rule of 50, whereby individuals in industrialized economies consume roughly 50-times more external energy and manufacture roughly 50-times more material than do hunter-gatherers. Results Industrialization and mechanization, powered by fossil fuels, have promoted centralization and processing in food production, reduced physical activity, and increased air pollution (including greenhouse gas emissions). These developments have led in turn to NCD and climate change. Discussion and Conclusion Climate change and NCD are connected both to one another and to our species' deep evolutionary dependence on external energy. Transitioning to carbon-free energy is essential to reduce the existential risks of climate change, but will likely have only modest effects on NCD. With the impending exhaustion of oil, coal, and natural gas reserves, developing replacements for fossil fuels is also critical to maintaining our species' external energy portfolio.

AB  - The intrinsic antiferromagnetic (AFM) interlayer coupling in the two-dimensional magnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4 places a restriction on realizing a stable quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) [Y. Deng et al., Science 367, 895 (2020)]. Through density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate the possibility of tuning the AFM coupling to the ferromagnetic coupling in MnBi2Te4 films by alloying about 50% V with Mn. As a result, the QAHE can be achieved without alternation with the even or odd septuple layers. This provides a practical strategy to get a robust QAHE in ultrathin MnBi2Te4 films, rendering them attractive for technological innovations.

AB  - Background Household food insecurity is positively associated with weight among women. The association between household food insecurity and pregnancy-related weight gain and complications is not well understood. Objective To identify whether an independent association exists between household food insecurity and pregnancy-related complications. Design Data from the Pregnancy, Infection, and Nutrition prospective cohort study were used to assess household food insecurity retrospectively using the US Department of Agriculture 18-item Core Food Security Module among 810 pregnant women with incomes <= 400% of the income/poverty ratio, recruited between January 2001 and June 2005 and followed through pregnancy. Main outcome measures Self-reported pregravid body mass index, gestational weight gain, second trimester anemia, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and gestational diabetes mellitus. Statistical analyses performed Multivariate linear, multinomial logistic, and logistic regression analyses. Results Among 810 pregnant women, 76% were from fully food secure, 14% were from marginally food secure, and 10% were from food insecure households. In adjusted models, living in a food insecure household was significantly associated with severe pregravid obesity (adjusted odds ratio 2.97, 95% confidence intervals [CIs] 1.44 to 6.14), higher gestational weight gain (adjusted beta coefficient 1.87, 95% CI 0.13 to 3.62), and with a higher adequacy of weight gain ratio (adjusted beta .27, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.50). Marginal food security was significantly associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (adjusted odds ratio 2.76, 95% CI 1.00 to 7.66). Conclusions This study highlights the possibility that living in a food insecure household during pregnancy may increase risk of greater weight gain and pregnancy complications.

AB  - Waste management is a global environmental problem. This article addresses research gaps in rural waste management in Ghana by establishing the willingness, and factors determining the willingness of rural residents to pay for waste management services (WMS). A Logit model was used to estimate the determinants of willingness to pay (WTP) for WMS, and a Tobit model was used to assess the determinants of the amount willing to pay for WMS. Factors that positively affect WTP for WMS are gender, marital status, education, monthly earnings, house ownership, mode of disposal, quantity of waste, and the distance to disposal. Age, household size, and adaptability have a negative effect. Gender, education, monthly earnings, house ownership, mode of disposal, the quantity of waste, and the frequency of disposal positively influence the amount respondents are prepared to pay, while age, household size, and adaptability to change negatively influence the amount to pay for improved WMS.

AB  - The building industry is facing a huge challenge as the industry sector carries much responsibility of the anthropogenic climate change: activities associated with housing alone account for as much as 30% of global annual energy demand. This demand derives not only from the physical characteristics of the buildings, but from the actions of the users, both end-users and professional managers. Even the best designed low-energy buildings will not perform is planned, if they are not operated properly. This study focuses on the role of professional managers in the energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) performance of existing urban and suburban housing. Several different types of housing companies with different housing managers are studied by both quantitative (input-output based hybrid life cycle analysis to estimate building performance) and qualitative I:interviews to determine manager awareness and attitudes) means. It can be inferred from the study that housing managers through their attitudes and practices have a significant impact on the energy performance of buildings. Notwithstanding, managers feel as though they do not either have the responsibility or the power to make energy conservation a priority. Financial (long payback time) and even social (occupant discomfort) arguments are used to justify the lack of action. While housing managers readily hold the data, and have the professional skills for effective energy management, managers appear not to have an ethical motive for practicing energy-efficiency. In other words, managers have the potential to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of housing companies, but the potential is currently not fully exploited. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Social sustainability plays a significant role in achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs), especially in emerging economies. Textile and clothing is a labour-intensive industry and presents serious challenges to adopting social sustainability at various stages of the supply chain. The objective of this research is to analyse the perspectives of brands, clothing manufacturers (tier-1) and textile manufacturers (tier-2) on the barriers to social sustainability in multitier textile and clothing supply chains operating in India. Twenty barriers have been shortlisted through an exhaustive search of extant literature followed by a survey among textile and clothing supply chain practitioners. Seven barriers related to consumers, regulation and norms, and financial aspects are found to be common cause-group barriers for all three stages of the supply chain. Lack of top management commitment, lack of competitive pressure and lack of policy on social sustainability are omnipresent as effect-group barriers. However, the relational barriers between the partners (low price offered and pressure for further cost reduction from the brands) reveal the existence of conflicting perceptions at different stages of the textile and clothing supply chain. This implies a lack of synergy and symbiotic dependence, which has been analysed through the lenses of three different organisational theories. This article contributes by underpinning the tire-wise perspectives of barriers to social sustainability in the textile and clothing supply chain. The policymakers and supply chain managers would find the results helpful for making strategies to adopt and implement social sustainability leading to achieving SDGs.

Integrating these two concepts can help advance the development of landscape sustainability science.ObjectivesThis study was intended to explore the different ways that EPVR can contribute to landscape sustainability science.ResultsEPVR can contribute to the science and practice of landscape sustainability in multiple ways: (1) as an economic solution; (2) as an axiological research perspective; (3) as a multi-disciplinary, all-round and multi-level system concept; (4) as a dynamic mechanism with socioeconomic flows in landscape mosaic; (5) a holistic methodology through interdisciplinary integration; (6) as a landscape sustainability research approach following the "resource assetization-asset capitalization-capital monetization" chain of steps.ConclusionsEPVR can contribute to landscape sustainability science in the following ways: to assist identifying landscape pattern by ecological product survey and monitoring; to promote landscape governance by natural-resource value transformation; to consolidate the resource base of sustainable landscapes with ecological compensation; to optimize landscape pattern by balancing the supply and demand of ecological products; to enhance landscape biodiversity by restoring ecosystems; and to optimize landscape sustainability evaluation using the comprehensive evaluation method of EPVR.

AB  - This paper aims to present the implications brought by the expansion of "renewable products" plantation systems in the tropics with cultivation of rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) as a main focus. Throughout South East Asia, natural forest is being replaced by rubber or oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) plantations, with severe consequences for the local flora and fauna. Main aspects of this review are: i) The provision of an overview over renewable resources in general and rubber in particular, with eco-physiological and agronomical information concerning rubber cultivation. ii) The effect of rubber plantations on biodiversity and species composition under different rubber farming approaches. In addition we debate the possible influences of such large scale land cover transformations on ecosystem services. iii) The conversion of natural forests into rubber plantations releases considerable amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. We estimated these values for different land cover types in southern China and assessed the carbon sequestration potential of local rubber plantations.

AB  - The use of scenarios and quantitative modelling to identify pathways for energy system transformations in line with the Paris targets is well established in the field of energy and climate policy. The resulting decarbonization pathways depend on both assumptions and the type of model used (e.g., integrated assessment models, energy system, macro-econometric or bottom-up sector models). The objective of this article is to analyze how energy demand sectors in system-wide net-zero scenarios for the EU compare to the results of sector-specific models. To this end, a novel approach referred to as "sectoral benchmarking" is developed and applied, combining the application of standard indicators such as energy intensity, electrification rate or carbon intensity with an index decomposition analysis. The combined approach allows visualizing how system-wide decarbonization pathways differ from the sector models' pathways by bringing the model output in a harmonized format for an efficient comparison. The analysis compares pathways from four different modelling tools: two European system models, one of which is an energy system model (EU TIMES) and the other a macro-econometric model (NEMESIS); as well as two sector-specific models, for transport (ALADIN) and for the industry and building sectors (FORECAST). We evaluate the system model's net-zero scenarios by comparing them to a corridor given by the sector models' current policy and net-zero emission scenarios. This corridor represents what the sector models deem as plausible from their bottom-up perspective within the boundaries of current policies and ambitions to reach net-zero.Our results show that the system model net-zero pathways differ substantially from the sectoral perspective in all sectors. In the industry and building sectors, both system models' decarbonization ambitions are within the sector corridor, but the employed mitigation levers differ. In the industry sectors, the sectoral model achieves substantial CO2 emission reductions with electrification, while the system models use more bioenergy (EU TIMES) or more energy efficiency (NEMESIS). In the building sector, both system models rely mostly on electrification, while the sector models relies on biomass and some district heat and electrification. In the transport sector, both system models' decarbonization ambition is substantially lower than the sector model's.The observed differences are caused by a variety of factors, which we evaluate in this article. One reason is the system models' lower ambition to decarbonize the end-use sectors due to their ability to compensate with negative emission technologies across sectors. In addition, employed mitigation levers differ due to the models' differing capabilities to consider technologies as well as differences in the allocation of bioenergy to sectors.Our findings can be used to determine how the different types of models can inform each other and to make the diverging decarbonization pathways more transparent to policy-makers and other relevant stakeholders.

AB  - The impact of waste policies and measures from National Determined Contributions (NDCs) on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is unexamined and creates conditions for policy conflict and incoherence. This participatory case study of North Macedonia quantifies synergies and trade-offs. Our results show twelve times more synergies than trade-offs. The most important synergies concern SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth (score: 10) and SDG 3: Good health and well-being (score: 5) since formalizing the recycling sector is expected to create jobs, economic productivity is expected to improve as a result of increased resource efficiency in industry, and declining pollution is expected to increase health through adequate waste management in landfills. On the other hand, the most important trade-off pertains to SDG 1: No poverty (score: 3) because the incomes of informal workers are expected to decrease, affecting financially vulnerable families. In conclusion, despite being the least emitting sector globally, the waste sector is a promising avenue for mitigating climate change because of its synergistic effects with the SDGs. Circular economy policies in line with the 3Rs: reduce, reuse and recycle hold the most potential for synergies in developing countries. This case study generated momentum for policy implementation by highlighting policy synergies and ideas for the next revision of the NDC. Central to this was the process of fostering dialogue and learning among otherwise siloed policy actors.

AB  - This review examines how local and regional coral reef management can be better informed by economic valuations. Results from the Western Indian Ocean show that supporting services are underrepresented, while cultural and provisioning services, where clear markets exist, are overrepresented in both the number of studies conducted and values assigned. These services are generally assessed using different methods meaning comparisons cannot be made across services. The largest number of services flows to beneficiaries at a local scale, consequently the cumulative value of ecosystem services is largest at this scale. However, the average value of a single service appears greatest, when flowing to beneficiaries at a global scale, creating biases in ecosystem service assessments. Furthermore, inconsistencies in classification and definition, particularly concerning regulating and option services exist. Findings suggest that if regional managers are to base their decisions on current valuation studies, their choices are likely to result in unexpected and undesirable tradeoffs. There is a need for (1) new and standardized methods that adequately account for supporting services; (2) studies to consider multiple ecosystem services simultaneously and across scales; and (3) a greater interdisciplinary understanding of how and why ecosystem services contribute to human well-being, under differing social contexts.

AB  - The degree of capitalisation of agricultural subsidies into land rents has been mainly determined by different payment implementation systems and land markets. The 2013 EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform introduces a transition of Single Farm Payment towards a flat rate system and entitlement reallocation. Based on 2009-2017 Farm Business Survey data, we used the Arellano-Bond dynamic panel data estimation technique to estimate the capitalisation impact of the 2013 CAP reform to decoupled payments (DP) in Northern Ireland (NI) where a short term conacre land rental system is dominant. Our estimates suggest that under the 2013 CAP reform in NI, the capitalisation of DP into land rental prices has continued even when entitlements are less than eligible land areas. Specifically, the marginal effect on rental rates of an additional pound of the DP is 22 pence, increasing to 43 pence following the 2013 CAP reform but only in the first year. Given that about one-third of land area is rented in NI, land capitalisation will be of particular relevance in designing more efficient future subsidy policies.

AB  - Human health and well-being, and how they are affected by terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems have been the subject of numerous studies. In contrast, there are very few such studies relating to marine ecosystems. Here, in the context of the Mediterranean Sea, we assess evidence of the broad interplay of relationships between marine habitats and human health and well-being. Our review shows that the major Mediterranean marine habitats provide various provisioning, cultural and regulating services that improve physical and mental health in a number of different ways. These include: (i) the provision of seafood rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which help to reduce the risk of developing certain types of illnesses; and also, species that produce bioactive compounds that are potential sources of new drugs; (ii) the provision of blue spaces - areas of water suitable for leisure and recreational activities able to inspire, educate, and appeal to the aesthetic senses - that not only increase physical and psychological health, but also foster an individual and collective sense of place and identity and contribute to improving social relations; and (iii) the regulation of climate change, and of water quality and pollution, for example via sequestration of carbon and heavy metals, thus reducing the associated health risks. Our results show that Mediterranean marine habitats are valuable for health and well-being, thus highlighting the need to conserve as much of these habitats as possible (particularly through marine protected areas) and to carry out new studies to determine the specific causal pathways by which certain characteristics of marine habitats - including biotic (e.g. marine biodiversity) and abiotic (e.g. water quality) factors - affect human health and well-being.

AB  - Payments for ecosystem services have come to dominate international policies for addressing tropical deforestation. Political ecologists, degrowth scholars, and Indigenous activists have critiqued these approaches on the grounds that by centering economic growth, they can disrupt local conservation systems and compromise forestdwelling communities' ability to protect forests and live well. Meanwhile, Indigenous groups have developed positive alternatives to 'green growth' strategies, including buen vivir (good living) in Latin America. In Peru, the National Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) serves as the state's flagship initiative to address tropical deforestation in Indigenous communities by paying communities for demonstrated reductions in deforestation, so long as they invest those funds according to an agreed up on management plan. We analyzed how the NFCP has interacted with quality-of-life plans, Indigenous planning tools rooted in buen vivir. Our findings suggest that the NFCP has eroded local systems for conservation, including the minga, an Amazonian tradition of mutual aid and shared labor for subsistence livelihoods, pushing communities to replace these systems with commodity production and employer-employee relationships. We argue that instead of imposing onerous conditions and steering communities towards evermore commodity production, conservation initiatives should support the implementation of quality-of-life plans. We suggest that climate justice organizers, political ecologists, and degrowth scholars explore and advocate for such initiatives.

AB  - Capabilities need to be built from the bottom-up. Social innovations at the grassroots seek to present new solutions to existing social problems. However, since the poor suffer from limitations on their individual capabilities and agency, they engage in acts of collective agency to generate new collective capabilities that each individual alone would not be able to achieve. The question is: how can these acts of collective agency be initiated, supported and sustained in practice? What roles can development actors (such as the state, donors and NGOs) play in supporting these acts of collective agency? Drawing on the literature on social innovation, the capability approach, participation and empowerment, the paper argues that three crucial C-processes are integral conditions for promoting successful, scalable and sustainable social innovations at the grassroots, namely: (1) Conscientization; (2) Conciliation and (3) Collaboration. By linking the individual, collective and institutional levels of analysis, the paper demonstrates the importance of individual behavioural changes, collective agency and local institutional reforms for the success, sustainability and scalability of social innovations at the grassroots. The paper acknowledges conflict, capture and cooptation as potential limitations and recognizes the role of contextual factors in initiating, implementing and sustaining social innovations at the grassroots.

AB  - Environmental Not-In-My-Backyard (NIMBY) conflicts pose significant challenges to environmental sustain-ability and governance capacity, particularly in transition economies like China. However, existing literature has largely overlooked the potential for transforming environmental NIMBY conflicts into opportunities, leaving a gap in our comprehension of the underlying mechanisms facilitating such transformations. Building upon the traditional conflict transformation theory, we develop a theoretical framework of Environmental NIMBY Conflict Transformation (ENCT) specifically tailored to environmental NIMBY conflicts. To validate and enrich ENCT empirically, we employ the theory-testing process tracing approach, utilizing the case study of the Asuwei waste incineration plant as a representative case of the successful transformation of an environmental NIMBY conflict. Our findings reveal that intricate environmental NIMBY conflicts are not inherently destructive, but rather, when approached with suitable strategies, they possess the potential to be transformed into opportunities. Further-more, environmental NIMBY conflicts can undergo transformation through the underlying mechanisms of five main categories: actor transformation, structure transformation, mode transformation, issue transformation, and situation transformation. In addition, we further link the relationship between conflict and opportunity from ten subcategories. These insights are expected to encourage environmental regulators to adopt conflict-shifted perspectives when dealing with potential environmental justice movements, thereby improving the effective-ness of environmental governance.

AB  - Wind penetration into existing diesel systems to meet the load of a remote Jordanian village was assessed. Techno-economical analysis and thousands of hourly simulations were performed to design an optimal hybrid wind-diesel power plant to serve the loads of the village. The hybrid plant with 24% of wind-energy penetration, and comprised of five wind turbines and three diesel generators was found to be the optimal plant and it becomes feasible for wind speeds in the order of 5 m/s and more regardless of the diesel fuel cost. Utilizing this plant for electricity generation decreased the operational hours of the diesel generators by 10.3% in comparison with the diesel only situation. This led to a decrease of 21.3% in the diesel consumption. Consequently, 13.25 tons of greenhouse gas emissions can be avoided annually utilizing the proposed hybrid power plant for electricity generation in place of the existing diesel only system. Based on the obtained results, the studied village in particular and the remote Jordanian settlements in general are prospective candidates for deployment of the proposed hybrid wind-diesel power plant for electricity generation.

AB  - To achieve the twin aims of environmental improvement and economic progress, some cities in China have implemented a stringent environmental regulation, Daily Penalty Policy (DPP). Compared with previous environmental regulations, DPP dramatically increases the cost of environmental pollution, but it is unclear whether DPP can effectively control environmental pollution and improve economic development together. This study evaluates the environmental and economic effects of DPP by estimating the relationship between DPP and energy efficiency in time-varying difference -indifferences (Time-varying DID) models. Our results show that DPP increases the firm-level energy efficiency (beta =0.07, p < 0.01) as well as confirm the twin effects of DPP on environmental pollution (decline in coal consumption and pollution emissions) and economic development (increase in production output).

AB  - Various economic growth patterns differ in sustainability. Taking China and India as examples, this study parses the connotation of leading-industrialisation and crossing-industrialisation economic growth patterns. In addition, a theoretical framework of sustainable development, including economic, social, environmental and demographic sustainability, is constructed. Furthermore, the comparative analysis and case study method are used to compare the sustainability of the two patterns. Results demonstrate that the leading-industrialisation pattern relies on abundant and skilled human resources to promote the manufacturing industry, thereby achieving rapid and high-quality economic growth at the expense of the environment. Although it is superior in social sustainability, such as poverty proportion, employment rate, price stability and health condition, the pattern can lead to a gap in wealth and an imbalance in urbanisation. By contrast, we reveal that the crossing-industrialisation pattern depends on the elite talents and technological progress to promote the service industry with high economic potential, which is resource-efficient and environment-friendly. Meanwhile, it is characterised by a small gap between the rich and the poor, relatively balanced urbanisation and future demographic dividends. However, it cannot guarantee adequate employment, public health and stable prices with serious poverty. This study enriches the multidimensional framework of sustainable development and proposes several practical implications for the sustainable development of the two economic growth patterns.

AB  - The long-term mean air temperature has increased with continued greenhouse-gas emissions in the past decades in the Wei River Basin (WRB) (China), with little understanding of the changes in extreme temperatures. In this study, the change characteristics of both maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) temperatures at daily, monthly, and annual scales were fully examined, and their relations with the Arctic Oscillation (AO) were also explored. The modified Mann-Kendall trend test method (MMK) and heuristic segmentation method were employed to detect the trends and change points of the Tmax and Tmin at multiple scales, respectively. Subsequently, the cross wavelet transform was adopted to reveal the correlations between Tmax/Tmin and AO. Results indicated: (1) both monthly and annual Tmax and Tmin showed significantly increasing trends, whilst at daily scale they generally exhibited no obvious trends; (2) change points were found in monthly, seasonal, and annual Tmax and Tmin, implying that the stationarity of Tmax and Tmin series in the WRB has been ineffective; (3) AO had strong impacts on Tmax and Tmin changes in the WRB. Our results highlight the asymmetric response of Tmax and Tmin at the monthly, seasonal, and annual scales, which has great implications for ecosystem functions and agricultural production.

AB  - Coral reefs are among the most diverse ecosystems on the planet but are declining because of human activities. Despite general recognition of the human role in the plight of coral reefs, the vast majority of research focuses on the ecological rather than the human dimensions of reef ecosystems, limiting our understanding of social relationships with these environments as well as potential solutions for reef recovery. General frameworks for social-ecological systems (SESs) have been advanced, but system-specific approaches are needed to develop a more nuanced view of human-environmental interactions for specific contexts and resource systems, and at specific scales. We synthesize existing concepts related to SESs and present a human dimensions framework that explores the linkages between social system structural traits, human activities, ecosystem services, and human well-being in coral reef SESs. Key features of the framework include social-ecological reciprocity, proximate and underlying dimensions, and the directionality of key relationships and feedback loops. Such frameworks are needed if human dimensions research is to be more fully integrated into studies of ecosystem change and the sustainability of linked SESs.

AB  - This paper aims to investigate human-environment interactions in the Chinese context by studying land-use change in terms of agglomeration of human activities. The research is based on theories showing that resource flows agglomerate differently in the spatial dimension. The paper creates the urban-rural linkage index and decomposes the study area into three parts: urban, pen-urban and periphery areas. Research findings show that urban areas tend to experience faster arable land and built land change than the peri-urban and periphery areas. The findings also indicate that in the Chinese context of fast urbanization and economic growth, resource flows like people, capital, goods and information tend to agglomerate in the urban areas, followed by the small towns and medium cities, as well as the rural peripheries.

AB  - The relationship between income inequality, economic growth, and CO2 emissions is ambiguous both theoretically and empirically. Hence, this study examines the link between income inequality, economic growth and CO2 emissions in Ethiopia for time span covering 1979-2014 using ARDL bounds test and DOLS approach to cointegration. The Zivot-Andrews unit root test and Clemente-Montanes-Reyes unit root test reveal that some of the variables under consideration are stationary at level while others become stationary after first differencing. Both ARDL and DOLS approaches confirm that there is a long-run relationship among the series during the study period. The long-run empirical results show that a 1% increase in economic growth accounts for a 1.05% increase in CO2 emissions while a 1% increase in economic growth squared reduces CO2 emissions by 0.11%. The U-test result reveals that the relationship between CO2 emissions and economic growth confirms existence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis. The effect of income inequality on CO2 is not robust to alternative estimation techniques; it is statistically insignificant under the ARDL estimation, but DOLS estimates show that a 1% increase in income inequality increases CO2 emissions by 0.21% in the long-run during the study period. In the long-run, a 1% rise in urbanization, population size, energy intensity, and industrialization each positively contribute to environmental degradation in Ethiopia by 0.38%, 0.22%, 0.07%, and 0.11% respectively. Results from the Toda-Yamamoto Granger causality show a bidirectional causal relationship between CO2 emissions and all other variables except economic growth. CO2 emissions Granger causes economic growth with no feedback effect. Results suggested important policy implications in the light of achieving its 2030 targets of low-carbon economy for Ethiopia.

AB  - Purpose - In France, an application decree from February 2002 enumerates a series of operational indicators that companies must offer, including a number of accounting and financial items. The information expected notably includes working time organisation, gender equality, health and safety, disability policies, subcontractor arrangements, water, raw material and energy consumption and biodiversity efforts. The present study aims to account for the diversity of the social and environmental information that companies supply by focusing on three stakeholder categories: suppliers; customers; and employees. It also seeks to highlight possible variations among different sectors of activity; influence of three pillars of sustainability (economic, social and environmental); timeframe (short-term, long-term, analytical); and type of discourse (situational or action variables). Design/methodology/approach - Based on 40 French companies as a qualitative approach, the purpose of the present communication is to offer a discussion of the structuring modes applied to the information found in sustainability reports targeting stakeholders for all the companies belonging to the CAC 40 index. Findings - Mobilizing a structural contents analysis, its findings identify differentiated communications practices among the 40 companies in question. The study also unveils the existence of shorter-term approaches to sustainability action, contrasting to more long-term and/or analytical orientations. Finally, the reports in question all emphasized sustainability's "economic" dimension, with its "social" dimension being considered secondary and its "environmental" dimension coming last. This inquiry demonstrates that, in the French context, there is a far cry from corporate social responsibility (CSR) dimension and sustainable development (SD) vision. Originality/value - The paper provides an in-depth method to analyze CSR and SD reports through its structural discourse.

AB  - In the current debates on reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the mobility sector, hydrogen produced via water electrolysis from renewable electricity is commonly regarded to be a sustainable energy carrier with large potential for decarbonisation of the mobility sector. Directly produced at the refueling stations site, hydrogen greenhouse gas emissions are presently defined to be zero in e.g. the Directives of the European Union since emissions arising from the facilities construction are defined to be negligible. In order to check the validity of this assumption with respect to the latest technical developments in hydrogen supply, the present article aims to report the environmental performance of hydrogen being produced and compressed for mobility purposes. To this end, a state-of-the-art hydrogen refueling station (HRS) with an on-site alkaline electrolyser is assessed, which was built and operated in Berlin. Assuming electricity supply from wind energy generation, a life cycle assessment for the complete value chain was carried out where primary data for the build-up of electrolyser and HRS were obtained during decommissioning of the station. The results show that the construction of HRS and on-site electrolyser requires higher material and energy expenditures compared to previous investigations on similar but technically less advanced systems. These expenditures generate a significant footprint in the specific e.g. greenhouse gas emissions if the electrolyser is operated at a reduced load factor as it may be foreseen for grid stabilisation purposes. To ensure a strong reduction of emissions compared to conventional fuels, this load factor should be sufficiently high and should be defined to not fall under a certain threshold in upcoming directives. Besides, excessive use of supplies should be avoided and the refueling station should be operated with renewable electricity to the largest extent. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although the political and consumer consciousness has turned increasingly green, many firms continue to resist the adoption of environment-friendly technological innovations-even in the face of higher costs, negative health effects, and stricter government oversight. This article examines how business owners weigh the trade-offs associated with environment-friendly innovations by examining the role of prosocial motivation in their decision-making process. We use primary data to overcome a common restriction in studying environmental innovations-the scarcity of relevant data-to analyze how business owners' expectations, perceptions, and motivations affect innovation in organizational processes and, consequently, the level of environmental friendliness of their products or services. We found that prosocial motivation had a significant negative impact on innovation adoption and that it is expressed differently under high and low levels of customer compatibility-possibly because business owners have a larger number of competing social objectives and priorities. Our results further showed that the innovation's ability to satisfy downstream customer demands has the greatest impact on environment-friendly innovation adoption decisions by business owners. This study enhances our understanding of how business owners make innovation decisions based on competing business, environmental and social objectives and provides a foundation for future research in this area.

AB  - In 1996, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and the Republic of Panama's Environmental Authority, with support from the United States Agency for International Development, undertook a comprehensive program to monitor the ecosystem of the Panama Canal watershed. The goals were to establish baseline indicators for the integrity of forest communities and rivers. Based on satellite image classification and ground surveys, the 2790 km(2) watershed had 1570 km(2) of forest in 1997, 1080 km(2) of which was in national parks and nature monuments. Most of the 490 km(2) of forest not currently in protected areas lies along the west bank of the Canal, and its management status after the year 2000 turnover of the Canal from the U.S. to Panama remains uncertain. In forest plots designed to monitor forest diversity and change, a total of 963 woody plant species were identified and mapped. We estimate there are a total of 850-1000 woody species in forests of the Canal corridor. Forests of the wetter upper reaches of the watershed are distinct in species composition from the Canal corridor, and have considerably higher diversity and many unknown species. These remote areas are extensively forested, poorly explored, and harbor an estimated 1400-2200 woody species. Vertebrate monitoring programs were also initiated, focusing on species threatened by hunting and forest fragmentation. Large mammals are heavily hunted in most forests of Canal corridor, and there was clear evidence that mammal density is greatly reduced in hunted areas and that this affects seed predation and dispersal. The human population of the watershed was 113 000 in 1990, and grew by nearly 4% per year from 1980 to 1990. Much of this growth was in a small region of the watershed on the outskirts of Panama City, but even rural areas, including villages near and within national parks, grew by 2% per year. There is no sewage treatment in the watershed, and many towns have no trash collection, thus streams near large towns are heavily polluted. Analyses of sediment loads in rivers throughout the watershed did not indicate that erosion has been increasing as a result of deforestation, rather, erosion seems to be driven largely by total rainfall and heavy rainfall events that cause landslides. Still, models suggest that large-scale deforestation would increase landslide frequency, and failure to detect increases in erosion could be due to the gradual deforestation rate and the short time period over which data are available. A study of runoff showed deforestation increased the amount of water from rainfall that passed directly into streams. As a result, dry season flow was reduced in a deforested catchment relative to a forested one. Currently, the Panama Canal watershed has extensive forest areas and streams relatively unaffected by humans. But impacts of hunting and pollution near towns are clear, and the burgeoning population will exacerbate these impacts in the next few decades. Changes in policies regarding forest protection and pollution control are necessary.

AB  - The objective of this study is to present a novel tool for predictive modelling of urban growth. The proposed tool, named iCity-Irregular City, extends the traditional formalization of cellular automata (CA) to include an irregular spatial structure, asynchronous urban growth, and a high spatio-temporal resolution to aid in spatial decision making for urban planning. The iCity software tool was developed as an embedded model within a common desktop geographic information system (GIS) with a user-friendly interface to control modelling operations for urban land-use change. This approach allows the model developer to focus on implementing model logic rather than developing an entire stand-alone modelling application. It also provides the model user with a familiar environment in which to run the model to simulate urban growth. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - As a developing country, economic and environmental performance has to be balanced in India. Green supply chain management (GSCM) is emerging as an important proactive approach for Indian enterprises for improving environmental performance of processes and products in accordance with the requirements of environmental regulations. This study examines the consistency approaches by confirmatory factor analysis that determines the construct validity, convergent validity, construct reliability and internal consistency of the items of Sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) requirements. This study examines the consistency approaches by Confirmatory factor analysis that determines the adoption and implementation of Sustainable supply chain management activities in small & medium scale industries. The requirements include Management commitment, customer coordination, sustainable design & production, green procurement and eco logistics for sustainable supply chains. This study suggested that the five factor model with eighteen items of the sustainable supply chain design had a good fit. Further, the study showed a valid and reliable measurement to identify critical items among the requirements of sustainable supply chains.

AB  - Diet plays a crucial role in cognitive function. Few studies have examined the relationship between dietary patterns and cognitive functions of older adults in the Korean population. This study aimed to identify the effect of dietary patterns on the risk of mild cognitive impairment. A total of 239 participants, including 88 men and 151 women, aged 65 years and older were selected from health centers in the district of Seoul, Gyeonggi province, and Incheon, in Korea. Dietary patterns were determined using Reduced Rank Regression (RRR) methods with responses regarding vitamin B6, vitamin C, and iron intakes, based on both a one-day 24-h recall and a food frequency questionnaire. Cognitive function was assessed using the Korean-Mini Mental State Examination (K-MMSE). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between dietary pattern score and the risk of mild cognitive impairment. A total of 20 (8%) out of the 239 participants had mild cognitive impairment. Three dietary patterns were identified: seafood and vegetables, high meat, and bread, ham, and alcohol. Among the three dietary patterns, the older adult population who adhered to the seafood and vegetables pattern, characterized by high intake of seafood, vegetables, fruits, bread, snacks, soy products, beans, chicken, pork, ham, egg, and milk had a decreased risk of mild cognitive impairment compared to those who did not (adjusted odds ratios 0.06, 95% confidence interval 0.01-0.72) after controlling for gender, supplementation, education, history of dementia, physical activity, body mass index (BMI), and duration of sleep. The other two dietary patterns were not significantly associated with the risk of mild cognitive impairment. In conclusion, high consumption of fruits, vegetables, seafood, and protein foods was significantly associated with reduced mild cognitive impairment in older Korean adults. These results can contribute to the establishment of dietary guidelines targeting older Korean adults to reduce mild cognitive impairments. Future prospective cohort studies are warranted to examine the effect of the seafood and vegetable dietary pattern on reducing mild cognitive impairment to prove the cause-effect relationship between dietary patterns and cognitive function.

AB  - The region containing 17 Asian countries located on and around the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (Asian Water Tower) is experiencing a serious ecological crisis, representing a major challenge for both Asian and global ecological conservation. Identifying and synergizing multiscale ecological conservation priorities for this region can promote progress toward the goals proposed by the post-2020 global biodiversity framework (e.g., protecting 30% of the planet) and Sustainable Development Goal 15 (life on land). We mapped the importance of and interactions among 5 key ecosystem services (ESs) (water conservation, carbon sequestration, sand fixation, soil conservation, and biodiversity conservation) across this region and identified areas where synergistic ESs were present. We further identified synergistic national-and regional-scaled conservation priority areas. The areas with "high importance" of the composite ESs accounted for 18.9% of the total region. Seventy-two percent of this area was found to have an overlap of at least 2 ESs. Approximately 33.3% of the study region was identified as a regional-scaled conservation priority area, which can be implemented synergistically in each country. Approximately 22.5% of the land in the priority area was nonecological land, which can seriously compromise the importance of ESs. A set of actions to support achieving global conservation goals, such as strengthening the control of anthropogenic activities in priority conservation areas, providing additional efforts and assistance to some key countries, and developing effective ecological compensation schemes, was provided.

AB  - Some impactful but unfavorable results of rapid urbanization are human-nature disconnection, waste of energy/ water resources, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. To save the future of our planet, a transition to a more sustainable urban life is a must. However, there is no single sustainable city model because cities differ in terms of their assets. Hence, locally customized sustainable actions linked to global sustainability should be developed, such as a change in individual behaviors leads to a sustainable society, city, and country. This research investigated green citizen profiles and variables affecting the profiles in the context of environmental behavior and sustainability. For this purpose, survey research was done at the household level in a metropolis in Turkey. Measurement scales about environmental concern, human-nature connections, and sustainable consumption behavior were used for collecting data. A data analysis approach was proposed as the survey dataset contains mixed-type variables. It amalgamates statistics with machine learning algorithms, namely two-stage clustering with multilayered self-organizing maps, k-medoid clustering algorithm, factor analysis, permutational multivariate analysis of variance, principal component analysis and classification and regression trees algorithm. The results reveal that (i) five distinct profiles, namely unconscious greens, risky greens, economic greens, potential greens, and wasters are identified, none of which is entirely green; (ii) district, family life-cycle, household size, number of rooms, altruistic and biocentric environmental concerns are the most critical variables in distinguishing profiles; (iii) the proposed approach enables processing socio-demographic, psychographic, behavioral and consumption variables together.

AB  - The conversion of natural areas to human-dominated land uses has been the major cause of global biodiversity decline and ecosystem degradation. Protected areas have been the most common strategy for reducing habitat and species loss. Effective conservation planning requires current information on land change dynamics, and the factors driving these changes. Therefore, our main goal was to assess the implications of land change on present and future protected areas. Specifically, we identified hotspots of reforestation and deforestation in Colombia between 2001 and 2010, and we determined the factors that explained land change within these hotspots. We identified four reforestation hotpots located mainly in the highlands of the Andes, and four deforestation hotpots that were located in the lowlands. Environmental and armed conflict variables explained most of the variation in the woody vegetation and agriculture/pasture classes, respectively. Although protected areas cover 12% of the country, only 4% of the reforestation and deforestation hotspots included protected areas. In Colombia, as well as the rest of the world, the majority of protected lands occur in remote regions where there are little to no economic activities and threats. Although we recognize the importance of this conservation approach, particularly for long-term conservation of large areas, we believe that complementary approaches that incorporate current land change dynamics are essential for future protected area planning. These approaches would place higher value on establishing new protected areas in regions that are undergoing rapid land change or regions where agricultural activities have been abandoned and ecosystems are beginning to recovery. The first approach would have immediate conservation benefits, while the second approach could bring ecosystem benefits in the short to intermediate-term and biodiversity benefits in the medium to long-term. These complementary approaches can provide helpful information for protected area conservation planning in a world with rapid land change.

AB  - Urban and peri-urban forests provide a wide range of benefits especially by providing the inhabitants with numerous ecosystem services that contribute to maintaining and improving the quality of life and environment in urban areas. Studies on urban and peri-urban forests have mainly focused on analyzing citizens' perception of benefits provided by urban green spaces. However, less attention has been paid to the influence that a positive perception of urban and peri-urban forests benefits has on citizens' willingness to play an active part in the planning and management process of green urban spaces. This study aims to explore the willingness of the citizens of the city of Palermo, in Italy, to devote time in the planning, design and management of urban forestry projects and identify which factors (perception, socio-demographic, and attitudinal factors) affect this choice. Results highlight that the socio-demographic characteristics (e.i. gender, income, number of family members) and frequency of visits are the main predictors of an individual's intention to commit time to urban forest projects. Our results also reveal a moderate impact of perception and psycho-attitudinal factors on citizens' intention to participate in urban forestry plans. It is thus evident that knowledge of urban and peri-urban forest characteristics and of the ecosystem services they are able to provide are the key factors to promoting effective conservation and management of green spaces, and to motivate citizens' participation through effective engagement strategies put in place by local governments.

AB  - Ecosystem restoration is an urgent and vital measure to restore degraded land in ecologically fragile regions. The terrestrial carbon sequestration capacity is important to indicate the effectiveness of ecosystem restoration, which has attracted the interest of many researchers. Ecologically fragile regions cover a large area in China, but few studies have focused on the carbon benefit of ecological restoration in these regions. In this study, we investigated the spatial and temporal changes in the carbon benefit, indicated by net primary productivity (NPP), in ecologically fragile regions in China. We evaluated the contributions of ecological restoration and climate change to terrestrial ecosystem carbon sink changes. The results showed that the ecological restoration projects significantly improved the carbon sequestration capacity in most of the ecologically fragile regions. From 2001-2017, the annual NPP of the entire study region was 460.1 +/- 5.4 Tg C yr(-1), and more than 70 % of the ecologically fragile region experiencing a significant (p < 0.05) increase. The effect of ecological restoration projects significantly intensified and was the main driver of the NPP growth in 87 % of the study region. The land use and land cover (LULC) change pattern indicates that the restoration project-induced conversion of agricultural land contributed to nearly 10 % of the total carbon sequestration after 2010. However, some extreme climatic conditions weakened the effectiveness of ecological restoration projects, highlighting the need for stricter management. Finally, this study identified the key area for effective ecological restoration in ecologically fragile regions in China.

AB  - Managing nature-based solutions (NBS) in urban areas for carbon mitigation and biodiversity outcomes is a global policy challenge, yet little is known about how to both assess and weave diverse knowledge systems and values into carbon-biodiversity trade-off assessments. This paper examines the spatial relationships between biophysical and social values for carbon sequestration potential (measured as carbon dioxide, CO2, flux) and biodiversity in Helsinki, Finland, using integrated valuation. The approach combines methods from carbon sequestration modelling, expert scoring approaches to biodiversity assessment and public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS). Results indicate strong spatial associations between biophysical assessment of CO2 flux and biodiversity priorities, and weaker associations between biophysical and social values. Integration of social and biophysical values leads to multiple pathways for protection of NBS to achieve carbon mitigation and biodiversity outcomes, as well as options for the spatial targeting of education and capacity building programs to areas of local concern.

Biological adaptations, in addition to technological innovations, have enabled these geographical and cultural explorations. The study of these adaptations helps not only to fundamentally understand our evolution as a species, but also may have increasing relevance as genomics transforms fields such as personalized medicine. Here we review three cultural and environmental shifts that have brought about adaptations in modern humans; the arctic, high altitudes, and a subsistence dependent on breath-hold diving.

AB  - This study evaluated the individual as well as integrated impacts of climate and land use change on streamflow over Meenachil river basin, Kerala, India. The hydrological model SWAT was used to simulate future streamflow simulations under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios for the medium term (2025-2055) and long term (2056-2086). The land use land cover change was projected using land change modeler (LCM) of TerrSet software for the future period. Climate model simulations were taken to predict future streamflow at the regional scale, and an attempt was made to reduce the uncertainty associated with future predictions. According to the findings, streamflow was influenced by climate change (68.07%) and land use change (31.92%), with climate change having a higher contribution rate. The findings suggest that the combined impact of climate and land use change would increase streamflow in the future. The annual average streamflow is expected to decline (5.9%) in the medium term (2025-2055) under RCP 4.5 scenario and rise by 5.3% under RCP 8.5 scenario compared to the observed streamflow for the period 1987-2017. However, in the long term, it is expected to rise by 10.56% under RCP 4.5 and 22.61% under RCP 8.5.

AB  - A spatially explicit dynamic model was developed that combines water quantity and quality processes for an average Dutch peat polder. The model has been used to calculate the consequences of climate change for surface water level, groundwater level and nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes, based on time series (2036-2065) of the two most extreme climate change scenarios for the Netherlands (G and W+) developed by the Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute. It was calibrated using measured data from two existing polders. The results suggest that surface water levels will not change much in both scenarios. Hence, the current practice of letting extra water in during dry summer periods to maintain sufficient water levels will probably remain a viable solution to temporary summer droughts in the near future as the required water volumes are not likely to increase greatly. Late summer groundwater levels decrease substantially in the W+ scenario but not in the moderate G scenario. This drop in groundwater level would accelerate the on-going process of peat oxidation, resulting in increased soil subsidence, greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient release from mineralisation. The W+ scenario also led to higher nitrogen concentrations and lower phosphorus concentrations in the ditch network Probably the reduced stream velocity in the W+ scenario results in an increased sedimentation of (adsorbed) phosphate. Sedimentation is a less important process in the nitrogen cycle, and the increased nitrogen concentrations anticipated in summer according to the W+ scenario are therefore probably the consequence of a reduced outlet of water due to increased evaporation. Additionally, an increased delivery of nitrogen through mineralisation could also contribute to the increased nitrogen concentrations in summer. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper evaluates the influence that climate change could exert on electricity demand patterns in Spain conditioned on the level of warming, with special attention to the seasonal occurrence of extreme demand days. For this purpose, assuming the currently observed electricity demand-temperature relationship holds in the future, we have generated daily time series of pseudo-electricity demand for the recent past and the twenty-first century by using simulated temperatures from statistical downscaling of global climate model experiments. We show that both the frequency and severity of extreme electricity demand days at the national level are expected to increase, even for low levels of regional warming. Moreover, the occurrence of these extremes will experience a seasonal shift from winter to summer due to the projected temperature increases in both seasons. Under a RCP8.5 scenario of greenhouse gas emissions, the extended summer season (June-September) will concentrate more than 50% of extreme electricity demand days by the mid-century, increasing to 90% before the end of the century. These changes in electricity demand have considerable spatial heterogeneity over the country, with northwestern Spain experiencing the seasonal shift later than the rest of the country, due to the relatively mild summer temperatures and lower projected warming there.

AB  - Hydrologic modeling plays a very important role in assessing the seasonal water availability, which is necessary to take decisions in water resources management. Both climate and land use and land cover change have great influence on the hydrological response of a watershed. The main aim of this study is to provide a detailed review of studies which have been carried out to analyze the hydrological impacts of land use change, and also to evaluate different scenario modeling approaches. In addition, a brief description of basic hydrologic models which are used to simulate the stream flow is provided. This review paper tried to explain the importance of model comparison and performance evaluation in modeling studies. The following conclusions may be drawn from this review: (1) it is necessary to model the possible impacts of land use change and climate change in order to proceed with effective water resources management, (2) it is important to analyze the variation in hydrological response in catchments with different land use characteristics and climatic conditions and also under climate scenarios, and (3) integration of different models with hydrologic models can be considered as an efficient method to forecast future trends in hydrological response.

AB  - Carbon capture and storage is part of Canada's climate change action plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Containment and Monitoring Institute Field Research Station contributes to scientific and technological progress that ensures the secure underground storage of CO2. In this study, the process of shallow CO(2)gas injection (300 m) and subsequent plume development at the FRS was investigated using numerical simulation. Due to reservoir uncertainties, various sensitivity analyses were performed to illustrate their effects on CO(2)saturation, plume distribution and CO(2)dissolution in a saline reservoir in response to variations in horizontal permeability (k(h)),k(v)/k(h)ratio and CO(2)injection rate. The distance of horizontal migration of the plume post-injection was predicted analytically, and the result was validated against the numerical simulation prediction. Results show that increases ink(v)/k(h)ratio resulted in increases in both vertical and lateral plume migration and in decreases in dissolution rate and CO(2)solubility. It was also indicated that the subsequent post-injection CO(2)migration rate was independent of bothk(v)/k(h)and previous injection rate. Dissolution varied significantly with changes in horizontal permeability. The model shows that increased horizontal permeability facilitated plume migration vertically and horizontally. Modeled permeability variations in horizontal permeability (k(h)) andk(v)/k(h)ratio had a progressively decreasing effect on plume vertical migration with time, while lateral migration effects increased with time.

AB  - Many countries are considering nuclear power as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and the IAEA (IAEA, 2022) has forecasted nuclear power growth rates up to 224% of the 2021 level by 2050. Nuclear power plants release trace quantities of radioxenon, an inert gas that is also monitored because it is released during nuclear explosive tests. To better understand how nuclear energy growth (and resulting Xe emissions) could affect a global nonproliferation architecture, we modeled daily releases of radioxenon isotopes used for nuclear explosion detection in the International Monitoring System (IMS) that is part of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty: 131mXe,133Xe,133mXe, and 135Xe to examine the change in the number of potential radioxenon detections as compared to the 2021 detection levels. If a 40-station IMS network is used, the potential detections of 133Xe in 2050 would range from 82% for the low-power scenario to 195% for the high-power scenario, compared to the detections in 2021. If an 80-station IMS network is used, the potential detections of 133Xe in 2050 would range from 83% of the 2021 detection rate for the low-power scenario to 209% for the high-power scenario. Essentially no detections of 131mXe and 133mXe are expected. The high growth scenario could lead to a 2.5-fold increase in 135Xe detections, but the total number of detections is still small (on the order of 1 detection per day in the entire network). The higher releases do not pose a health issue, but better automated methods to discriminate between radioactive xenon released from industrial sources and nuclear explosions will be needed to offset the higher workload for people who perform the monitoring.

AB  - The increase in greenhouse gasses (GHG) anthropogenic emissions and deforestation over the last decades have led to many chemical and physical changes in the climate system, affecting the atmosphere's energy and water balance. A process that could be affected is the Amazonian moisture transport in the South American continent (including La Plata basin), which is crucial to the southeast Brazilian water regime. The focus of our research is on evaluating how local (i.e. Amazon deforestation) and global forcings (increase of atmospheric GHG concentration) may modify this moisture transport under climate change scenarios. We used two coupled landatmosphere models forced by CMIP6 sea surface temperatures to simulate these processes for two scenarios: i) increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) - RCP8.5 atmospheric levels (00DEF), and ii) total Amazon deforestation simultaneous with atmospheric CO2 levels increased (100DEF). These scenarios were compared with a control simulation, set with a constant CO2 of 388 ppm and present-day Amazon Forest cover. The 30 -year Specific Warming Level 2 (SWL2) index evaluated from the simulations is set to be reached 2 years earlier due to Amazon deforestation. A reduction in precipitation was observed in the Amazon basin (-3.1 mm & sdot;day- 1) as well as in La Plata Basin (-0.5 mm & sdot;day-1) due to reductions in the Amazon evapotranspiration (-0.9 mm & sdot;day-1) through a stomatal conductance decrease (00DEF) and land cover change (100DEF). In addition, the income moisture transport decreased (22 %) in the northern La Plata basin in both scenarios and model experiments. Our results indicated a worse scenario than previously found in the region. Both Amazon and La Plata hydrological regimes are connected (moisture and energy transport), indicating that a large-scale Amazon deforestation will have additional climate, economic and social implications for South America.

AB  - The consumption of fossil fuels by motor vehicles has increased greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. The automotive industry has invested in environmental technologies to reduce these emissions. This study aimed to determine whether in light-duty vehicles deploying environmental technologies met the energy efficiency ratings of the Brazilian Vehicle Labelling Programme (BVLP) in 2013, 2015, and 2017. In 2013, Brazil implemented the 'INOVAR-AUTO' regulation to improve vehicle energy efficiency. Based on information from the BVLP database, the actual efficiencies of light-duty vehicles were compared with those mandated by the regulation. The effectiveness of the regulation was assessed using the growth rates of the energy consumption and annual A ratings. The results showed that certain powertrain technologies increased the energy efficiency, resulting in many vehicles with A ratings from the BVLP. The use of three-cylinder engines and variable valve timing (VVT) had the highest positive effects on improving the energy efficiency. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Due to the presentation of the European Green Deal (EGD) on 11 December 2019, it is important to introduce a new context for the education of architects corresponding to the objectives set by the European Union. These include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing the energy efficiency of buildings, designing buildings in accordance with the principles of the circular economy, using renewable energy, as well as promoting ecological food and protecting biodiversity. As part of the design course Environmentally Friendly Housing Architecture, inspired by, among others, the design of the New European Bauhaus and the former Bauhaus art school, both of which are compared in the first part of this article, we identify a number of new, assessed design indicators related to the achievement of the above objectives, in line with the trend of sustainable architecture. The indicators are divided into four main categories: energy, environment, indoor climate, and society, where, for example, the environmental category includes the following criteria: embodied energy (MJ/m(2)), embodied carbon footprint (CO(2)eq/m(2)), use of rainwater and gray water (% of demand), use of mains water (% of demand), local production of vegetables and fruit (% of demand). During the design process, changes were made to achieve better indicators, and the final designs were described using radar charts. The paper presents a statistical summary of the achieved values for individual indicators, the progress achieved, exemplary design solutions, and the assessment of the methodology used. The design course Environmentally Friendly Housing Architecture was assessed by the participants by means of a questionnaire.</p>

AB  - Bioenergy is an important renewable energy resource. However, assessments of the future of bioenergy are beset with uncertainty and contested values, suggesting that a precautionary approach to bioenergy resource development may be warranted. This paper uses UK MARKAL to examine the implications of adopting a precautionary approach to bioenergy development in the UK. The paper reports a detailed review of UK bioenergy resources and sustainability constraints, and develops precautionary and optimistic resource scenarios. The paper then examines the implications of these scenarios using the energy systems model MARKAL, finding that a precautionary approach adds to the cost of decarbonisation, but does not significantly alter the optimal technology mix. In particular, biomass and co-firing CCS emerge as optimal technologies across scenarios. The question of UK land availability for bioenergy production is highlighted within the paper. With less land available for bioenergy production, the costs of decarbonisation will rise; whereas if more land is available for bioenergy, then less land is available for either food production or ecosystem conservation. This paper quantifies one side of this trade-off, by estimating the additional costs incurred when UK land availability for bioenergy production is constrained. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

By exploiting rich micro-level data on Ethiopian workers, we evaluate the effect of the Ethiopian trade reforms on the changes and composition of employment. We find that districts more exposed to trade liberalization experienced reductions in their employment levels, especially in female employment. We also show that reductions in tariffs trigger a process of sectoral reallocation from agriculture to services and that this process is particularly pronounced for women.

AB  - The high recovery performance of steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) makes it a popular option for heavy oil resources. Currently, most of the heavy oil reservoirs developed by SAGD in China are in the late development phase, with high energy consumption due to reduced thermal efficiency. The use of SAGD wind-down processes involving CO2 in combination with steam for heavy oil recovery is considered as a viable alternative to limit energy consumption, and also reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions by leaving CO2 behind in the reservoir. Study reveals that the dissolution and demulsification of CO2 in crude oil can reduce the viscosity of emulsified heavy oil by more than 50%. When the steam chamber temperature reaches 200 degrees C, the amount of solid phase deposition induced by CO2 extraction is only 0.016 kg/m(3), the rock wettability changes from lipophilic to hydrophilic, and the higher the reservoir temperature, the stronger the hydrophilicity is, which reduces the adhesion power of the oil phase and facilitates the stripping of crude oil from the rock surface. Numerical simulation studies have been carried out utilizing STARS to obtain energy efficient utilization and improved steam chamber characteristics. Heat loss from SAGD baseline is 1.77 times that with CO2 injection process, but the recovery factor is only 2.48% higher. At the initial stage with CO2 injection, the steam chamber continues its lateral expanding, which increases the recovery factor at the initial stage of CO2 injection by about 6%. One year after CO2 injection, gas channeling results in lower recovery than traditional SAGD process, and 38.4% of the injected CO2 is stored in the reservoir from this study.

AB  - Human use of land increasingly alters the structure and the functioning of the environment. To ex-ante understand and anticipate these changes there is an increased need for readily available and operational land use change models. One of these models is CLUE, which has been used in many studies all over the world. These studies brought forward operational hurdles, that hamper model application. The overall objective of this paper is to present a new version of the CLUE model, iCLUE, that helps to overcome these hurdles. We describe the technical redevelopment, conceptual innovations, several applications and success factors and critical reflections. iCLUE minimizes manual error-prone actions, enhances ease-of-use, speeds up the operational modelling process and provides data visualisations to empower users to analyse and interpret results.

AB  - The OECD recently released a comprehensive set of 11 well-being indicators, the so-called Better Life Index (BLI), for 36 countries. The BLI covers a wide range of socio-economic aspects of life, which are essential to well-being. This well-being dataset allows us to compare countries' overall well-being. However, in spite of the BLI's wider coverage of variables, it fails to consider sustainability concerns. This study provides a practical proposal for comparing overall well-being by incorporating sustainability concerns. Using the World Bank's adjusted net savings data as a sustainability indicator, we add an extra dimension to the BLI. Then, we apply a composite indicator and aggregate these 12 indicators for each country into a single number. Moreover, we improve the current method for constructing composite indicators by adopting corrected convex non-parametric least squares ((CNLS)-N-2). It is a typical problem in a non-parametric approach based on linear programming for countries' scores of composite indicators to become equal and their performance cannot be distinguished. This becomes even more severe if the number of sample countries is small or the number of aggregated indicators is large, which is the case of the present study dealing with 12 indicators for 36 countries. The use of (CNLS)-N-2, which is based on quadratic programming, overcomes this problem and allows us to order all countries in the sample completely. The empirical results show that the introduction of a sustainability indicator for comparisons does not change countries' overall rankings significantly. However, it certainly changes the ranking of some countries in both directions.

AB  - The inclusion of various waste products in concrete mixes was studied, with the intent of being used in an aviation construction project. The waste products investigated were waste plastic aggregates, fly ash and recycled glass powder as supplementary cementitious materials, waste glass sand as fine aggregate partial replacement, and waste latex paint as a polymeric admixture. The objective of the mix design testing was to develop three concrete mixes which met specific design requirements set by the project whilst reducing greenhouse gas emissions and landfill mass when compared with standard mix designs provided by the concrete plant. A three phase trial mix design process was followed, where the influence of plastic aggregate as a natural aggregate binder replacement was investigated, in conjunction with the addition of fly ash as a supplementary cementitious material, glass sand and waste paint. Through testing for the hardened properties of the concrete mixes, and microscopic analysis of cross-section samples, mix designs which achieved the structural performance objectives were developed. A Life Cycle Assessment to compare the potential environmental impact reduction of the recycled material mix designs was conducted, focusing on the product stage considering the variation in quantity of raw materials (A1) across mixes, and their transport (A2) to batching plant located in Auckland. The LCA found that two of the three recycled material mix designs gave potential environmental impact reductions of over 10% in six of the 7 categories, and over 20% in three of the 7 categories.

AB  - Despite considerable debate over the environmental effectiveness of industry agreements, there remains a lack of systematic comparative data as to which design features most influence their ability to encourage corporations to reduce environmental impacts. Using an analytical framework to assess the motives for, negotiation and implementation of industry agreements, this paper reviews agreements developed in Australia, Germany and the UK to regulate industrial greenhouse-gas emissions. It is argued that, contrary to the popular view that agreements are generally useful only as transitional instruments on the way to legislation or economic instruments, they can act as important drivers of change in corporate attitudes and behaviour, especially when combined with the threat of economic instruments. Conclusions are drawn on the merits of different design features to improve the environmental performance of agreements, including reporting, monitoring, and the use of legal and financial sanctions to ensure compliance with agreed targets.

AB  - Rising inequality threatens the improvement of human well-being. As an important type of green infrastructure within cities, urban green spaces provide ecosystem services and contribute to human health. The inequalities of per capita urban green space area and ecosystem services are critical environmental justice and public health issues but are not well understood. Based on the spatial patterns of green spaces, land rent, and the population of 20 cities in China, we assessed the inequalities of per capita green space area and ecosystem services by using the Gini coefficient. Results showed that, (1) the Gini coefficient (an indicator to measure inequality) of per capita available ecosystem services was 0.430, which was greater than that of per capita green space area (0.357), (2) the inequality of per capita ecosystem services had a negative relationship with city size measured by population and GDP, and (3) the inequality of green space area was negatively related to the subjective quality of life, while the inequality of ecosystem services was negatively related to the economic competitiveness of cities. We suggest that urban planners comprehensively consider multiple indicators (such as per capita green space area, Gini coefficients of per capita green space area and ecosystem services) to simultaneously evaluate the efficiency and equality of green space construction.

AB  - Energy demand attributable to the operation of supermarkets is thought to be responsible for 1% of UK greenhouse gas emissions. Current building regulations in the UK require the building related energy use of new commercial buildings to comply with particular requirements. Supermarket buildings are therefore modelled in considerable detail, according to these protocols to establish their predicted energy demand. Lighting, occupancy, and small electrical energy impacts are included in this modelling. However, a large gap is found between the design outputs of this modelling and the energy performance of the store in operation. One reason for this is that thermal interactions at the refrigeration cabinets are not included in this modelling, as refrigeration is classified as process energy rather than building related. This paper explores the comparative energy demands of supermarket retail floors simulated both with and without the cooling effect of refrigeration cabinets included in the simulation. The retail floor of a recently built supermarket is modelled using EnergyPlus. Practical applications: It has been shown that the energy demand of the retail floor of a new store could be reduced by 25% by improvement of the envelope, by halving ventilation rates and doubling insulation levels. This has been shown by simulation of the building energy flows with refrigeration cabinets included in the modelling (whereas these are currently excluded as process energy). Changes in modelling protocols, and regulations, to encompass refrigeration energy transfers, could reduce the national load, due to supermarkets, by at least 140MW in 5 years. Energy costs to the retailer would be reduced by 20%. Additionally, the simulation has shown the contribution of rooflights to the reduction of energy demand to be lower than previously predicted, saving only around 1/3 of design expectations.

AB  - Centaurea maculosa (Lam.) (spotted knapweed) reduces wildlife and livestock habitat biodiversity and increases erosion. Nutrient availability to plants may be used to accelerate succession away from spotted knapweed. Early-successional plant communities often have high nutrient availability, whereas late-successional communities are often found on lower nutrient soils. We hypothesized that removal of nutrients would change the competitive advantage from spotted knapweed to Pseudoroegneria spicatum (bluebunch wheatgrass) (late seral). In two addition series matrices, background densities of Secale cereale (annual rye) and Elymus elimoides (bottle-brush squirreltail) (3,000 seedS/m(2)) were used to remove nutrients from the soil. In another set of addition series matrices, nitrogen (33 kg/ha) or phosphorus (33 kg/ha) were added to the soil. Nutrient analysis of soil and vegetation indicated that annual rye and bottle-brush squirreltail reduced nutrient availability in soils. In another matrix, neither a background density nor nutrients were added. Data were fit into Watkinson's curvilinear model to determine the competitive relationship between bluebunch wheatgrass and spotted knapweed. This allowed comparison of the equivalence ratios (C) generated from each addition series. The C parameters are the per-plant equivalent of bluebunch wheatgrass or spotted knapweed and can be interpreted as the ratio of intra-to-interspecific competition. The C parameters are also the equivalence ratio of the number of spotted knapweed it takes to have equivalent effect on bluebunch wheatgrass or the number of bluebunch wheatgrass having the equivalent effect on spotted knapweed. Without nutrient manipulation, spotted knapweed was more competitive than bluebunch wheatgrass. The C for bluebunch wheatgrass was 0.17, indicating that 0.17 knapweed plants were competitively equivalent to one wheatgrass. Annual rye changed the competitive balance in favor of bluebunch wheatgrass (C = 9.9). Addition of nitrogen, phosphorus, or the mid-seral species did not change the competitive relationship between the two species. This preliminary study suggests that succession from spotted knapweed to late-seral bluebunch wheatgrass community may be accelerated by altering resource availability.

AB  - The production components of an evergreen shrub (Ilex crenata Bennett's Compacta') grown in a no. 3 container in an east coast U.S. nursery were analyzed for their costs and contributions to carbon footprint, as well as the product impact in the landscape throughout its life cycle. A life cycle inventory was conducted of input materials, equipment use, and all cultural practices and other processes used in a model production system for this evergreen shrub. A life cycle assessment (LCA) of the model numerated the associated greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), carbon footprint, and variable cost of each component. The LCA also included the transportation and transplanting of the final product in the landscape as well as its removal after a 40-year useful life. GHG from input products and processes during the production (cutting-to-gate) of the evergreen shrub were estimated to be 2.918 kg CO(2)e. When considering carbon sequestration during production weighted over a 100-year assessment period, the carbon footprint for this model system at the nursery gate was 2.144 kg CO(2)e. Operations, combining the impact of material and equipmerit use, that contributed most of GHG during production included fertilization (0.707 kg CO(2)e), the liner and transplanting (0.461 kg CO(2)e), the container (0.468 kg CO(2)e), gravel and ground cloth installation (0.222 kg CO(2)e), substrate materials and preparation (0.227 kg CO(2)e), and weed control (0.122 kg CO(2)e). The major contributors to global warming potential (GWP) were also major contributors to the cutting-to-gate variable costs ($3.224) except for processes that required significant labor investments. Transporting the shrub to the landscaper, transporting it to the landscape site, and transplanting it would result in GHG of 0376, 0.458, and 0 kg CO(2)e, respectively. Variable costs for postharvest activities were $6.409 and were dominated by labor costs (90%).

AB  - Technology-based financial innovations over the past four decades have led to transformations in the financial markets. Understanding technological innovations in financial information systems (IS) and technologies has been challenging for technology consultants and financial industry practitioners due to the underlying complexities though. In this article, we propose an ecosystem analysis approach by extending the technology ecosystem paths of influence model (Adomavicius et al., 2008a) to incorporate stakeholder actions, considering both supply-side and demand-side forces for technological change. Our ecosystem model brings together three original core elements: technology components, technology-based services, and technology-supported business infrastructures. We also contribute a fourth new element to this approach involving stakeholder analysis. We investigate innovations in the area of high-frequency trading (HFT) technologies as a basis for empirically validating the existence of several different patterns in the historical path of technology evolution. Our analysis results suggest that supply-side and demand-side forces influenced HFT technology innovations and contributed to changes in the financial markets. This research represents some of the first work that investigates financial market technology innovations at the technology and stakeholder levels. It also offers a useful and practical tool to help managers and analysts to understand the nature of technology-based financial innovations and the relationships between technology and financial markets that support their emergence.

AB  - The growing intensity of international commerce and the high share of total global greenhouse gas emissions by the maritime sector have motivated the implementation of regulations by the International Maritime Organisation to curtail vessel emissions. In this context, waste heat recovery (WHR) is an effective way to improve ship energy efficiency, lower amounts of wasted energy rejection to the environment, and therefore ultimately curb green-house gas emissions. Presently, there exists a heterogeneity within the body of literature concerning WHR technologies for on-board applications, study scope and results, complicating the interpretation and cross comparison of the outcomes. Sporadic attempts have been made to review and systematise this landscape, leaving some key areas uncovered. Therefore, the present article aims at filling these gaps by providing and holistic review of WHR technologies development and on-board applications. Further, the energy systems and available waste heat characteristics in large vessel types are overviewed, before both existing and developmental on-board waste heat recovery technologies for maritime applications are reviewed. Emphasis is placed on the performance of these technologies within the broader on-board energy system. Common key performance indicators are drawn from existing systems, experimental prototypes, and simulations, to quantitatively compare the different technologies. This review indicates that a wide range of technological options for embedding waste heat recovery in on-board energy systems are emerging. In particular, traditional turbocompounding is already fully implemented within the marine waste heat recovery (WHR) context. Conversely, ORC systems and absorption refrigeration systems have not yet been suitably adapted for marine applications due to a lack of research and prototypes, despite their deployment in conventional WHR contexts. Other technologies, such as thermal energy storage devices, hybrid refrigeration systems, isobaric expansion engines, Kalina Cycles, and adsorption desalination and cooling systems, are still at the research and development stage, while thermoelectric generation systems continue to incur high deployment costs. The development of research on these innovative technologies, the reduction of their cost and their synergistic integration could lead to significant improvements inengine fuel efficiency and emissions reduction, especially when coupled with existing waste heat recovery measures.

AB  - Safety pharmacology is an essential part of drug development aiming to identify, evaluate and investigate undesirable pharmacodynamic properties of a drug primarily prior to clinical trials. In particular, cardiovascular adverse drug reactions (ADR) have halted many drug development programs. Safety pharmacology has successfully implemented a screening strategy to detect cardiovascular liabilities, but there is room for further refinement. In this setting, we present the INSPIRE project, a European Training Network in safety pharmacology for Early Stage Researchers (ESRs), funded by the European Commission's H2020-MSCA-ITN programme. INSPIRE has recruited 15 ESR fellows that will conduct an individual PhD-research project for a period of 36 months. INSPIRE aims to be complementary to ongoing research initiatives. With this as a goal, an inventory of collaborative research initiatives in safety pharmacology was created and the ESR projects have been designed to be complementary to this roadmap. Overall, INSPIRE aims to improve cardiovascular safety evaluation, either by investigating technological innovations or by adding mechanistic insight in emerging safety concerns, as observed in the field of cardio-oncology. Finally, in addition to its hands-on research pillar, INSPIRE will organize a number of summer schools and workshops that will be open to the wider community as well. In summary, INSPIRE aims to foster both research and training in safety pharmacology and hopes to inspire the future generation of safety scientists.

AB  - We examined the differences among seventeen European countries regarding the extent to which several key institutional and labor market characteristics affect the degrees of insecurity that people feel about their jobs and employment prospects, as well as their well-being (economic security and subjective well-being). We estimate how macrostructural factors affect well-being by fitting random-intercept multi-level models and decomposing the variance across national and individual levels, using data from the 2004 and 2010 European Social Surveys. We find that there is substantial country-level variation in labor market insecurity, economic security and subjective well-being. Active labor market policies, the generosity of unemployment benefits, and collective bargaining coverage explain a considerable portion of the identified differences among countries in labor market insecurity and well-being. The effects of employment protection legislation vary depending on whether the worker has a permanent or temporary contract. We did not find substantial differences between 2004 and 2010, suggesting that the effects of institutions and worker power on labor market insecurity and well-being reflect longer-term structural changes associated with the transformation of employment relations.

AB  - The climate and energy nexus have drawn global attention towards sustainable solutions for synthetic processes, such as waste management. Innovative policies can amend waste management systems to be more sustainable, as in Hong Kong, where besides the conventional landfilling, alternatives like incineration and biological treatment methods are being considered to develop an integrated system. However, the outcomes appear uncertain and need to be analysed for best possible integration. This study proposes a customized methodology for impact assessment of these waste treatment technologies and evaluates five integrated scenarios in terms of net greenhouse gas emissions (GHEs) and energy use by applying classified modelling approaches. The baseline results revealed that compared to the landfilling alone, integration of landfilling with combined anaerobic digestion and composting (ADC) reduced up to 56% of net GHEs. Incineration with ADC saved up to 87% GHEs and ranked as the best-case scenario in both impact categories. Considering carbon sequestration as a credit suggested that landfill-linked scenarios were suitable for GHEs saving, while landfilling alone remained the worst case. The uncertainty propagation and sensitivity analysis revealed that some key parameters can alter the ranking order of scenarios, when variated by the reported uncertainty. The study provides useful modelling insights into the critical nature of these technologies and can be considered as a decision-making tool locally, as well as a generic calculation template.

AB  - Reliable crop type maps are vital for agricultural monitoring, ensuring food security, and environmental sustainability assessments. Coarse-resolution imagery such as MODIS are widely used for crop type mapping due to their short revisit cycles, which is advantageous for detecting the seasonal dynamics of different crop types. However, the inherently low spatial resolution may restrict their utility for mapping crop types in regions with heterogeneous agricultural landscapes. Agricultural statistics, which provide crop acreage information at different spatial and temporal scales, have the potential to improve crop type mapping from remote sensing. Yet, previous studies have often used agricultural statistics as reference data to evaluate the accuracy of satellitederived crop type maps but have rarely utilized them to improve crop type distribution mapping. The utility of integrating agricultural statistics with satellite images to produce high-accuracy crop type maps is rarely explored. This study presents a methodology for mapping sub-pixel crop type distributions via the integration of MODIS time series and agricultural statistics. We tested our approach in Heilongjiang Province, which has the highest agricultural production in China. First, we used an optimized random forest regression (RF-r) model with training samples derived from high spatial resolution images (i.e. SPOT and Landsat) to predict the sub-pixel crop type distributions from MODIS time series. To optimize the RF-r model, an 8-day MODIS time series of five vegetation indices in 2011 were used as the candidate independent variables, and a backward feature elimination strategy was implemented to select the best variables for model prediction. Second, we developed an Iterative Area Gap Spatial Allocation (IAGSA) method to spatially reconcile the discrepancies between the crop acreage estimated from MODIS-based maps and the agricultural statistics. We found that the MODIS-derived crop fractions agreed with those derived from the high-resolution images, with R2 > 0.75 for all crop types, yet there was a clear discrepancy between the crop acreage estimated from MODIS and agricultural statistics. The subpixel crop type maps adjusted by IAGSA were not only consistent with the agricultural statistics for crop acreage, but also retained the spatial distribution patterns of the original MODIS-derived crop fraction. Our results suggest the advantages of integrating coarse-resolution images and agricultural statistics to map sub-pixel crop type distributions, and to provide consistent estimation of crop acreage. The presented methodology has the potential to map large-scale crop type extent across regions in a cost-effective way.

AB  - In recent years, most cities have experienced rapid population growth. Concurrently, international policies have called for substantial reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the resilience of energy-supply systems has become more important. Consequently, solutions to exhaust locally-available sources must be developed to minimize the fraction of fossil fuels for heating, cooling and electricity. This article shows an example of designing a low-temperature heating and cooling grid based on locally-available renewables and waste heat and introduces general hypotheses concerning smart energy planning in urban development zones. Taking an urban development area in Vienna, Austria, as example, it is shown that wastewater, geothermal and (office) waste heat, solar energy, and the heat content of ambient air can play an important role within a climate-friendly urban energy concept and that heating and cooling demand can be covered completely on-site. From an environmental point of view, the concept is promising, as greenhouse gas emissions and the non-renewable primary energy consumption can be reduced by over 70% compared to conventional gas heating, while, based on current (fossil) energy prices, it is economically not fully competitive. The gap could be closed e.g. by CO2 taxes on fossil energy sources or (temporal) subsidies for renewables. Additionally, reservations of stakeholders in the energy sector against this innovative approach must be dismantled.

AB  - Understanding how to create structural change by actively counteracting racialized ways of interacting with Indigenous peoples at an individual and organizational level within health care systems and health professions education is essential for creating a more inclusive, equitable, and healthier society. In health professions education, the primary means of teaching about health inequities has been to frame them as stemming from culturally or ethnically based issues. While attention to culturally specific practices can be valuable to health and healing in some contexts, education that solely focuses on Indigenous cultures risks perpetuating cultural stereotypes and othering, rather than focusing on how Eurocentric systems continue to exert oppressive effects on Indigenous peoples. We present an organizational transformation framework grounded in equitable partnerships from a comprehensive critical review of the literature on the integration of equity and social justice in undergraduate health professions education with a focus on Indigenous health. We did a thematic analysis of the results and discussions presented in the 26 selected articles to identify promising practices and challenges associated with the integration of equity and social justice in undergraduate health professions education. The framework resulting from this analysis is composed of three interrelated components: 1) adopt critical pedagogical approaches that promote Indigenous epistemologies; 2) partner with Indigenous students, educators and communities; 3) engage educators in critical pedagogical approaches and health equity issues. This framework could guide the development of contextually tailored interventions that contribute to decolonizing health professions education.

AB  - China's growth plans include a carbon emission peak policy, which is a restriction that indirectly impacts land use structure. In this study, we simulate different paths for achieving policy objectives, and explore the linkages between those paths and land use change. The IPAT model was used to simulate the carbon emissions generated from a natural development scenario, an ideal policy scenario, and a retributive carbon emission scenario in China from 2020 to 2030. The simulation results were incorporated into the CLUMondo model as a demand driver to simulate the land use change in 2030. The results show that carbon emission peak policy can somewhat reduce carbon emissions and increase building land in a regulated way. However, the policy may also lead to a short-term surge in carbon emissions, a reactive expansion of arable land and building land. This may reduce losses in economic development when carbon emissions are limited, but does not achieve the integration of social, economic, and ecological goals. This study links the carbon emission peak policy with land use change and provides a fresh perspective on the Chinese government's carbon reduction policy.

AB  - A green building (GB) is a design idea that integrates environmentally conscious technology and sustainable procedures throughout the building's life cycle. However, because different green requirements and performances are integrated into the building design, the GB design procedure typically takes longer than conventional structures. Machine learning (ML) and other advanced artificial intelligence (AI), such as DL techniques, are frequently utilized to assist designers in completing their work more quickly and precisely. Therefore, this study aims to develop a GB design predictive model utilizing ML and DL techniques to optimize resource consumption, improve occupant comfort, and lessen the environmental effect of the built environment of the GB design process. A dataset ASHARE-884 is applied to the suggested models. An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is applied, which involves cleaning, sorting, and converting the category data into numerical values utilizing label encoding. In data preprocessing, the Z-Score normalization technique is applied to normalize the data. After data analysis and preprocessing, preprocessed data is used as input for Machine learning (ML) such as RF, DT, and Extreme GB, and Stacking and Deep Learning (DL) such as GNN, LSTM, and RNN techniques for green building design to enhance environmental sustainability by addressing different criteria of the GB design process. The performance of the proposed models is assessed using different evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. The experiment results indicate that the proposed GNN and LSTM models function more accurately and efficiently than conventional DL techniques for environmental sustainability in green buildings.

AB  - The University of Northern British Columbia (UNBC) has implemented two bioenergy heating projects to demonstrate renewable energy and carry out research on sustainable resource usage. These projects are of particular interest to remote communities and further the institution's aim to be Canada's Green University (TM). The wood pellet system is a template for a community building heating system, while the gasification system is sufficient to supply a community scale district energy system. Both projects demonstrate that bioenergy can be implemented at an institutional level, low levels of particulate emissions are achievable, and that integrating campus operations with research provides relevant demonstration of leading-edge technology.

AB  - As education providers, universities play a pivotal role in developing and delivering quality education that contributes to the achievement of the "2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development" and the related "Sustainable Development Goals". Given the large impact of the built environment industry on global emissions and climate change, integrating environmental sustainability principles and architectural education is of paramount importance for the achievement of such targets.Through a systematic and comprehensive literature review, this article explores how and to what extent environmental sustainability considerations have been integrated within architecture curricula in tertiary edu-cation providers across North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania, highlighting common approaches, future directions and areas that still need further development. Over 500 published refereed research outputs were analysed and 111 selected for inclusion and discussion in this article, with attention given to understanding course structures, pedagogy, relationship with design studios, types of assessment, teaching and learning technologies, and engagement of the wider architecture profession across undergraduate and graduate architecture programmes. 68% of the documents use case study methodologies to evaluate the impact of sus-tainability education, while theory only papers represent 15% of the total. Studies using a combination of theoretical discussions and applicative evidence are the 17% of the total. Among the case studies category, it is to be noted that the work done at course level (26%) almost equals that done at curriculum level (29%), signalling that attention has been paid to both the macro and micro scale. The research shows that more attention in the past was given to the 'what' (content and structure of courses and programmes), while more recent studies focus on the 'how' (pedagogies and implementation processes for teaching and curriculum development purposes).The latest works, on the other hand, start to be more focussed on assessing students' learning and increase active engagement, in an attempt to shape the profile of future graduates and make them ready to produce the substantial market transformation still needed to achieve environmental sustainability goals worldwide.

AB  - The success of hotels and their contribution to the destination depends on the development of sustainability practices. The aim of this paper is to study possible interactions between environmental, economic and social sustainability practices with each other and with hotel performance. In these interactions, hotel performance is not considered as the final dependent variable. Hotel performance may play a mediating role as it may be considered as a consequence of environmental sustainability practices and as a means for economic and social sustainability practices. From a PLS analysis using data from 365 Spanish hotels, we find that environmental sustainability practices influence hotel performance and economic and social sustainability practices; hotel performance positively influences economic and social sustainability practices; and economic sustainability practices influence social sustainability practices. Moreover, hotel performance mediates the relationship between environmental sustainability practices and the other two dimensions of sustainability practices; and economic sustainability practices mediate the link between environmental and social sustainability practices. This study has theoretical and practical implications because it shows that environmental sustainability practices contribute to hotel performance, creating value for shareholders and owners; and environmental practices and the availability of financial resources contribute to the development of economic and social sustainability practices, also creating value for other stakeholders.

AB  - The response of blue and green water to climate and land-use change in the Ganjiang River Basin (GRB) is evaluated, via the SWAT model that combines three scenarios (the land-use/land-cover (LULC), climate change, and integrated climate and LULC change scenarios) in the 2040s (2031-2050) and 2060s (2051-2070). The results indicate that, for the GRB, cropland, woodland, and grassland show a decreasing trend, while build-up and water areas show an increasing trend in terms of future land-use change. The climatic conditions projected using NORESM1-M model data under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios suggest, respectively, increases in precipitation (31.17 and 27.24 mm), maximum temperature (2.25 and 2.69 degrees C), and minimum temperature (1.96 and 2.58 degrees C). Under climate change conditions, blue water is estimated to decrease by up to 16.89 and 21.4 mm under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, while green water is estimated to increase up to 19.14 and 20.22 mm, respectively. Under the LULC changes, blue water is projected to increase by up to 5.50 and 7.57 mm, while green water shows decreases of 4.05 and 7.80 mm for the LULC2035 and LULC2055 scenarios, respectively. Under the four combined LULC and climate change conditions (RCP4.5_2040s, RCP4.5_2060s, RCP8.5_2040s, and RCP8.5_2060s), blue water tends to decrease by 0.67, 7.47, 7.28, and 9.99 mm, while green water increases by 19.24, 20.8, 13.87, and 22.30 mm. The influence of climate variation on blue and green water resources is comparatively higher than that of the integrated impacts of climate and land-use changes. The results of this study offer a scientific reference for the water resources management and planning department responsible for scheduling water resource management plan in the GRB.

AB  - To assess the risks of Geologic Carbon Sequestration (GCS), it is crucial to understand the fundamental physicochemical processes that may occur if and when stored CO2 leaks upward from a deep storage reservoir into the shallow subsurface. Intermediate-scale experiments allow for improved understanding of the multiphase evolution processes that control CO2 migration behavior in the subsurface, because the boundary conditions, initial conditions, and porous media parameters can be better controlled and monitored in the laboratory than in field settings. For this study, a large experimental test bed was designed to mimic a cross section of a shallow aquifer with layered geologic heterogeneity. As water with aqueous CO2 was injected into the system to mimic a CO2-charged water leakage scenario, the spatiotemporal evolution of the multiphase CO2 plume was monitored. Similar experiments were performed with two different sand combinations to assess the relative effects of different types of geologic facies transitions on the CO2 evolution processes. Significant CO2 attenuation was observed in both scenarios, but by fundamentally different mechanisms. When the porous media layers had very different permeabilities, attenuation was caused by local accumulation (structural trapping) and slow redissolution of gas phase CO2. When the permeability difference between the layers was relatively small, on the other hand, gas phase continually evolved over widespread areas near the leading edge of the aqueous plume, which also attenuated CO2 migration. This improved process understanding will aid in the development of models that could be used for effective risk assessment and monitoring programs for GCS projects. Plain Language Summary Geologic carbon sequestration is a strategy that is currently being considered to help reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. This strategy involves injecting carbon dioxide deep underground in the hopes that it will safely stay there for long periods of time. However, the gas may eventually leak out of the storage location and travel back up toward the ground surface. If this happens, it could have negative effects on water resources, ecosystems, and human health. In order to better understand those potential risks, operators of carbon sequestration projects need to understand where the gas will go when it leaks. This study helped to improve that understanding and build predictive capability about carbon dioxide movement underground. Laboratory experiments were performed in a system that was designed to mimic an underground environment. Carbon dioxide was injected and sensors were used to measure where it went. Results showed that layers of different material slow down the movement of the gas.

AB  - National forest inventories (NFIs) are an important source of data for reporting greenhouse gas emissions and removals for the Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry sector as required by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol. A major limitation is that NFI resources are generally not sufficient for producing reliable information on year-to-year variation. Interpolation, extrapolation, smoothing, and/or aggregation of data from several years are therefore needed to comply with the reporting requirements for a specific year. Various methods for accomplishing this task are illustrated and evaluated based on data and experiences from the NFIs of six countries, concentrating on the estimation of the stem volume of living trees as a surrogate for tree biomass. Six main conclusions were drawn: (1) NFI data from the target years only were not sufficient for reliable estimation of annual stock change; (2) changes between whole inventory cycles (typically 5 years) could be estimated with reasonable precision; (3) simple moving average estimators of stock are problematic in the estimation of changes; (4) interpenetrating panel designs with permanent sample plots are desirable from the point of view of inter/extrapolating and change estimation; (5) data on annual growth variation and harvests are important and can be used directly in the default method, which is based on differences between increment and drain; and (6) time gaps between NFI surveys may lead to significant errors in the estimation of stock changes.

AB  - China's energy saving at the provincial level has important policy implications for the mitigation of the greenhouse gas emissions in the world. Therefore, this study uncovers the driving forces of the changes of the provincial energy consumption by distinguishing the domestic and interregional trade based on the MRIO-based SDA technique for the period of 1997-2011. We find that (1) final demand per capita was the top determinant of the increments in provincial energy consumption, while both energy intensity and production structure offset the provincial energy changes; (2) most of 30 provinces were outsourcers due to the close interprovincial linkages; (3) product flows from utility and raw materials of upstream resource-dependent provinces were supplied to the coastal provinces, which are the manufacturing hubs. This implies policy making for the reduction of provincial energy in China should simultaneously implement measures on production-side and consumption-side. This is even more important when considering the embodied energy due to the interprovincial linkages within China.

The method used in the research was bottom-up, linear programming optimisation model MARKAL code adapted as the MARKAL-Latvia model with improvements for perfecting the integrated assessment of climate policy. The modelling results in the baseline scenario, reflecting national economic development forecasts and comprising the existing GHG emissions reduction policies and measures, show that in 2030 emissions will increase by 19.1 % compared to 2005. GHG emissions stabilisation and reduction in 2030, compared to 2005, were researched in respective alternative scenarios. Detailed modelling and analysis of the Latvian situation according to the scenario of non-ETS sector GHG emissions stabilisation and reduction in 2030 compared to 2005 have revealed that to implement a cost effective strategy of GHG emissions reduction first of all a policy should be developed that ensures effective absorption of the available energy efficiency potential in all consumer sectors. The next group of emissions reduction measures includes all non-ETS sectors (industry, services, agriculture, transport, and waste management).

AB  - The Italian Law of 22 November 2016 has legalized the cultivation of hemp, which drives the development of sustainable agriculture by generating new products with high added value in the new context of circular economy. Hemp cultivation is known for its low environmental impact, as hemp grows fast, suppresses weeds and does not need pesticides. It has no specialized parasites, favors pollination and improves the physical and chemical soil fertility. Recently, many countries have increased their interest in hemp (Cannabis Sativa L.), considering it as a climate-friendly crop that can mitigate climate change and desertification. For these reasons, hemp can be a new protagonist of Italian agriculture already oriented towards the objectives of EU 2030 which predicts 40% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990. The hemp cultivation can activate a new supply chain by allowing using different parts of the plant, benefiting farmers, environment, and human health. Indeed, although a very old plant, hemp will be one of the main protagonists of the green economy in the near future. Its seeds can be used by agri-food industry to produce flour, pasta, pastry and oil, while the stem through canapulo (woody part of stem) in green building sector. Its fiber (external part of stem) will find new applications in textile industry. As for its inflorescences and roots, thanks to the extraction of bioactive molecules, they will play an important role in the pharmaceutical and parapharmaceutical industry. Finally, only the medical sector with Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) extraction from inflorescence is not yet regulated by the aforementioned Italian Law.

AB  - Climate change mitigation is one of the most important challenges facing the modern world. It is necessary to monitor the development of new concepts and technologies and take a stab at identifying disruptive innovations, which have the potential of becoming real climate-friendly game changers. The aim of this paper is to examine the patterns of inventive activity aimed at mitigating climate change in the maritime industry with respect to other transport modes. Appropriate research tools in the area of patent analysis were selected and utilised. A new class of patents related to climate change in maritime transport (CPC-Y02T70/00) was used as a data source. The original value of the study consists of offering a complete picture of the efforts made in patenting activity in climate change mitigation in the maritime transport, with a look at leading applicants and countries, knowledge flows, the most robustly developed and underdeveloped technical fields. A map of technical knowledge flows for climate change mitigation in transport was constructed. The research results show that inventions for the maritime industry are less hermetic than those for air and road transport; however, they are not as much linked with previously developed solutions. The most intensively developed technical fields include the design and construction of watercraft hulls (1) and measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions related to the propulsion system (2). Among the technologies whose further development merits close attention are solutions related to electrical propulsion and wave energy. At the same time, inventive activity in the area of climate change adaptation dedicated to ports is insignificant and definitely needs more support from the community of scientists and inventors. Building knowledge based on patent information can help universities, research institutions, shipyards, manufacturers of marine equipment and other business entities to identify the technologies of the greatest potential for further development.

This article explores the results of implementing Environmental Management Systems (EMSs) in a HEI in Greece. Specifically, the results of two surveys, focusing on students' perceptions in the University of the Aegean, are presented and analysed. The surveys were conducted prior and after the implementation of an EMS in the University. The survey results demonstrate several positive consequences from the implementation of EMS across the University campus. In particular, there is a positive influence on students' environmental awareness and behaviour, accompanied by greater preference among them for more participatory environmental management initiatives.

Studying the effects of land use change on carbon emissions can provide supports for the development policies of carbon emission. Using land use and energy consumption data, this study measures carbon emissions from land use dynamics in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from 2000 to 2020. The standard deviation ellipse model is employed to investigate the distribution characteristics of the spatial patterns of carbon emissions, while the Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression (GTWR) model is used to examine the contributing factors of carbon emissions and their spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Results indicate a consistently increasing trend in carbon emissions from land use in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from 2000 to 2020. Construction land is characterized with both the primary source and an increasing intensity of carbon emissions. Besides, the spatial distribution of carbon emissions from land use in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region demonstrates an aggregation pattern from in the northeast-southwest direction towards the center, with a greater aggregation trend in the east-west direction compared to that in the south-north direction. During the study period, a positive correlation was documented between carbon emissions and factors including total population, economic development level, land use degree, and landscape patterns. This correlation showed a decreasing trend and reached a stable level at the end of the study period. Moreover, the analysis showed a negative correlation between industrial structure and carbon emissions, which showed an increasing trend and reached a relatively high level at the end of the study period.

AB  - This paper studies the effect of carbon leakage on the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) using satellite nighttime light data. It shows that nighttime lighting is an important variable for estimating carbon dioxide emissions that is superior to other existing indicators and covers all countries in the world, finding evidence of an inverted-U shaped relationship between light and, thus, greenhouse gas emissions and income, with a turning point at approximately US$50,000. However, the relationship is primarily driven by changes in the structure of international trade, implying strong carbon leakage effects. Consequently, environmental regulations that become operative in only one part of the world may fail without global coordination.

AB  - Ever growing population and environmental degradation lead to a rapid deterioration of global health, causing malnutrition and Ultra Violet radiation-induced skin damages to be more prevalent. It is critical to address these health issues quickly and sustainably. Compared to natural botanicals, cyanobacteria could be more promising due to their superior photosynthetic capabilities, rapid growth, low space and simple nutrients requirements, low capital investment, and zero environmental pollution. Therefore, this study explores the value-added potential of freshwater cyanobacteria in addressing the above health issues sustainably. Eight cyanobacteria strains, isolated from freshwater reservoirs in the dry zone of Sri Lanka were analyzed for total carbohydrate, protein, macro and micro minerals using Dubois' method, Lowry method, and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry. Mansur equation was applied to determine the Sun Protection Factor (SPF). Total carbohydrate and protein contents were in the range of 7.08 +/- 0.32% - 53.08 +/- 0.32% and 15.27 +/- 0.90% - 49.77 +/- 9.62%, respectively. Oscillatoriales had the highest total carbohydrate content (53.08 +/- 0.32%), higher than the carbohydrate content of other previously reported Oscillatoria species. Calcium and iron were the most abundant macro and micro minerals, respectively. Oscillatoriales recorded the highest SPF (1.57 +/- 0.002), whereas all the other strains had considerably greater or similar SPFs compared to other previously reported herbal extracts. Cyanobacteria with rich nutrition profiles and high SPF values may thus represent interesting alternatives for offering sustainable and ecofriendly solutions to significant health challenges associated with population growth.

AB  - Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) forms part of Target 4.7 of Sustainable Development Goal 4 in the 2030 Agenda. This paper presents an effort to propose an evaluation framework of elementary school teaching materials in Taiwan for sustainable development considering three dimensions of sustainability: Environmental, social, and economic. The proposed framework comprises four levels: Lever 1, education for sustainable development; Level 2, teaching scopes; Level 3, learning indicators, and; Level 4, learning topics. This study first, through literature reviews, proposed an initial evaluation framework and then, through in-depth expert interviews, obtained a modified framework. Thereafter, the Delphi questionnaires were conducted to establish the final evaluation framework. The framework includes four teaching scopes, ten learning indicators and twenty-one learning topics. Furthermore, the weights of each scope and its associated indicators were analyzed and compared through AHP questionnaires to obtain the scoring table for sustainability teaching materials implemented in a school. Finally, the scoring table was applied to an existing elementary school to investigate its implementation of the teaching materials on sustainable development. Based on the result from the scoring table, the areas needed for improvement were identified and the improvement strategies were then proposed.

AB  - Biogas production from animal manure can address many negative impacts of traditional energy generation and also improve living conditions in rural communities in Egypt, the case study herein, and further afield. Even though techno-economical aspects of the household biogas digester technology have been thoroughly studied, its environmental sustainability, especially under Egypt's conditions, remains largely unknown. To this end, life cycle inventory data were collected from typical fixed-dome digesters operating in Egypt. Environmental modelling was based on the life cycle assessment methodology using SimaPro. It was identified that the 100-year global warming potential for producing 1 m(3) of biogas under Egypt's conditions amounts to 2.72 kg CO(2)eq., while its total environmental footprint was 160.1 mPt. The main contributor was the operational phase (89.1%), while the construction phase had a much smaller contribution (10.9%). The main environmental hotspots were identified as the manure required to drive the process, closely followed by biogas leakages and intentional releases. By minimizing biogas losses, the system's environmental sustainability largely improves (similar to 60% reduction) and could be on the same level with the one of larger biogas units operating in developing countries. Furthermore, it was identified that the digester volume plays an overall small role in the system's environmental performance; however, oversized digesters grossly affect the environmental sustainability, due to the large amounts of biogas intentional releases. Finally, the use of digestate as a biofertilizer appears to be environmentally sustainable (similar to 38% reduction of total environmental footprint). Taken together, the results obtained in this study provide substantial information for policy- and decision-making on renewable energy development in rural Egypt and beyond. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB  - The quantity of biomass in an ecosystem is constrained by energy availability. It is less clear, however, how energy availability constrains taxonomic and functional diversity. Competing models suggest biodiversity is either resource-limited or far from any bound. We test the hypothesis that functional diversity in marine bivalve communities is constrained by energy availability, measured as particulate organic carbon (POC) flux, in the modern oceans. We find that POC flux predicts the relative prevalence of ecological modes in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Moreover, the associations of ecological modes with POC fluxes are similar between the Atlantic and Pacific despite being based on independent sets of species, indicating a direct causal relationship. We then use the relationship between POC flux and the prevalence of functional groups in the modern to test the hypothesis that the trend of increasing functional diversity in bivalves across the past 500 Myr has occurred in response to increased POC flux. We find no evidence that the earliest-appearing modes of life are preferentially associated with low-POC environments or that the mean POC flux experienced by marine bivalves has increased across geological time. To reconcile the close association between ecological mode and POC flux in the modern oceans with the lack of evidence for increasing POC fluxes across time, we propose that POC flux has not increased substantially over time but, rather, the increase in bivalve functional diversity enabled bivalves to become more abundant, to occupy a broader range of environments, and to capture a greater fraction of the total POC flux. The results here suggest at the geographic scale of oceans and through geologic time bivalve diversity was not bounded by food availability.

AB  - The planet is on a path to catastrophic warming which calls for structural changes in the operation of Global North economies, not merely a transformation of energy sources, the core of "green growth" approaches. Our research on inequality and working time shows that these are powerful drivers of carbon emissions that can be the center of a progressive agenda supplementing energy transition. Our work also shows that disproportionality in emissions sources presents a policy opportunity. We challenge Pollin's view that only growth-centric approaches are politically viable, and argue that progressive politics has moved from growth-centricity to needs- and people-centered policies. In our response, we argue that the recent rise of the Green New Deal is a strong piece of evidence for our position.

AB  - Plant evolutionary history influences the taxonomic composition of the root-associated bacterial community, but whether it can also modulate its functioning is unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis that crop diversification is a significant factor determining the ecology of the functional group of nitrogen-fixing bacteria the rhizosphere of Poaceae. A greenhouse experiment was carried out using a range of Poaceae, i.e. four Zea mays varieties (from two genetic groups) and teosinte (representing maize's ancestor), sorghum (from the same Panicoideae subfamily), and wheat (from neighboring Pooideae subfamily), as well as the dicot tomato as external reference. Diazotroph rhizosphere community was characterized at 21 days in terms of size (quantitative PCR of nifH genes), composition (T-RFLP and partial sequencing of nifH alleles) and functioning (quantitative RT-PCR, T-RFLP and partial sequencing of nifH transcripts). Plant species and varieties had a significant effect on diazotroph community size and the number of nifH transcripts per root system. Contrarily to expectations, however, there was no relation between Poaceae evolutionary history and the size, diversity or expression of the rhizosphere diazotroph community. These results suggest a constant selection of this functional group through evolution for optimization of nitrogen fixation in the rhizosphere.

AB  - We examine the impact of information technology (IT) on talent management and operational environmental sustainability and propose a model in which IT infrastructure capability enables the firm's operational environmental sustainability through talent management. We test the proposed model using the structural equation modeling technique with an innovative secondary data set collected for a sample of 63 large Spanish firms. We find that a firm's proficiency in leveraging IT infrastructure improves the management of talent, which in turn enables execution of a more environmentally sustainable operations strategy to increase firm performance. This paper has three key contributions. First, as the first study of talent management in the context of IT and environmental sustainability, it provides a better understanding of the concept of talent management. We explain theoretically and test empirically how IT infrastructure capability influences operational environmental sustainability through talent management. Second, since we find that IT infrastructure capability increases firm performance through talent management and operational environmental sustainability, our research also improves knowledge of how IT infrastructure capability influences firm performance. Finally, this study advances theoretical conceptualization of operational capabilities, and the relationships between IT infrastructure capability and dynamic and operational capabilities.

AB  - Little is known about the relevance of alternative measures of growth in environmental and developmental economic analyses. In Canada, for example, no literature exists on whether there is a causal link between the level of environmental performance and alternative measures of economic progress (which are argued to better capture the overall economic wellbeing than the gross domestic product-GDP). As environmental policies may relate to overall economic wellbeing, we opine that understanding overall economic progress is essential for achieving sustainable development and emissions reduction targets. This paper addresses a knowledge gap by assessing the causal links and directions between Canada's national-level greenhouse gas emissions (GHG-as an indicator of environmental performance) and three alternative measures of economic growth, namely, gross national disposable income (GNDI), human development index (HDI), and index of economic freedom (IEF); from 1995 to 2019. Our results indicate that causality exists between Canada's GHG and the alternative growth measures. This implies that Canada's GNDI, HDI, and IEF may be useful and complementary to GDP in forecasting the national-level total GHG emissions. The research provides insights to further consider the role of overall economic wellbeing in the quest for sustainable, lower-emissions, economic development in Canada and by extension in other nations.

AB  - This paper studies the effect of climate change on simulated efficiency of carbon injection at different locations and ocean depths using an Earth system model of intermediate complexity, ISAM- 2.5D. Following the OCMIP carbon sequestration protocol, we carried out a series of carbon injection simulations. The ISAM results show that warming over the next 500 years under the IPCC S650 and WRE1000 stabilization scenarios could change the ocean circulation and thereby increases the residence time of CO2 disposed into the deep ocean, particularly for Atlantic injection. However, the warming does not have a significant effect on carbon injections into the Pacific and Indian Oceans, where circulation change is small. This new finding contrasts with previous OGCM results.

Furthermore, for the preparation of index weights, varimax rotation is used to get component loadings.FindingsThe study finds that the overall CESI values lies between 2 and 4.8 for the 20 emerging countries considered in the study. This study depicts a diverse picture of environmental sustainability among emerging countries. The study also shows the trend of CESI values from 1990 to 2020. The bottom three countries whose CESI is very low compared to others are Iran, South Africa and Saudi Arabia. However, Brazil, Columbia and Chile are top three highest scorers in 2020.Originality/valueThe study contributes to the literature by constructing a composite index comprising of three sub-indices to measure the environmental sustainability of an economy. These sub-indices include seven indicators that are more inclusive and comprehensive. To the authors' knowledge, this is a pioneering attempt in the construction of the index for emerging countries.

AB  - This study examines the role of top managers' values and leadership in advancing environmental sustainability. It also investigates the effects of stakeholder engagement on restaurants' environmental sustainability and assesses the impact of related practices on restaurant performance. A web-based survey was administered to collect data from top-level restaurant managers in the United States. The sample was selected from panels recruited by a research company specializing in panel surveys. Invitation emails were sent to 2500 managers and 240 responses were returned, 218 of which were retained for final analysis (response rate: 8.7%). Structural equation modeling was used for testing hypothetical relationships among key constructs in the proposed research model: environmental values, leadership, stakeholder engagement, environmental sustainability, and restaurant performance. Findings confirmed the significant role of top management values and leadership in advancing environmental commitment. The results also demonstrated the strong impact of stakeholder engagement on restaurants' commitment to environmental sustainability. Finally, they indicated the positive influence of restaurants' environmental sustainability performance on both financial and nonfinancial performance. The study presents a theoretical framework, integrating theories or models from extant literature, and contributes to an enhanced understanding of restaurants' environmental sustainability. The findings suggest several practical implications for managers in the restaurant industry. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soil salinity is one of the major environmental stresses affecting crop production worldwide, costing over $27Bln per year in lost opportunities to agricultural sector and making improved salinity tolerance of crops a critical step for sustainable food production. Salicylic acid (SA) is a signalling molecule known to participate in defence responses against variety of environmental stresses including salinity. However, the specific knowledge on how SA signalling propagates and promotes salt tolerance in plants remains largely unknown. This review focuses on the role of SA in regulation of ion transport processes during salt stress. In doing this, we briefly summarise a current knowledge on SA biosynthesis and metabolism, and then discuss molecular and physiological mechanisms mediating SA intracellular and long distance transport. We then discuss mechanisms of SA sensing and interaction with other plant hormones and signalling molecules such as ROS, and how this signalling affects activity of sodium and potassium transporters during salt stress. We argue that NPR1-mediated SA signalling is pivotal for (1) controlling Na+ entry into roots and the subsequent long-distance transport into shoots, (2) enhancing H+-ATPase activity in roots, (3) preventing stress-induced K+ leakage from roots via depolarisation-activated potassium outward-rectifying channel (KOR) and ROS-activated non-selective cation channels, and (4) increasing K+ concentration in shoots during salt stress. Future work should focus on how SA can regulate Na+ exclusion and sequestration mechanisms in plants.

AB  - Although green technological innovation is designed to combat climate change, recent research suggests that increased attention to technological innovations might decrease climate change risk perception and reduce pro-environmental behaviors due to the feeling of being assured, which is referred to as risk compensation behavior. Although there has been a growing interest in reducing the risk compensation effect related to climate change, the academic literature in this area is very limited. In this study, we propose a psychological intervention to mitigate a sample of university students' (N = 1,500) irrational response to green technological innovation so as to promote their pro-environmental behaviors. Our experiments identify students' mental construal level as an important psychological factor that, when combined with a proper message framing strategy of introducing new green technologies, can remedy their irrational response to new green technologies. Our findings suggest that highlighting the new technology as playing a preventive/promotional role related to climate change can mitigate risk compensation behavior and eventually promote students' pro-environmental behaviors when they are at a high/low mental construal level.

AB  - Mining engineering metaknowledge from electronic documents is important in devising new design solutions for emerging applications as well as in identifying new business opportunities. Continuously and comprehensively reviewing and assessing the entire technical literature to find the most relevant ideas and solutions is cumbersome as engineering innovations are constantly being proposed. In particular, high performance analog circuit design has been at the forefront of technological innovations given their importance in applications, like telecommunications, mobile applications, and health care. This paper proposes a model and mining techniques for representing analog circuit design metaknowledge. The metaknowledge representation includes three components: an associative component presenting the conceptual hierarchy of the considered circuits, a component expressing the performance capabilities (e.g., trade-offs and bottlenecks) of the circuits, and a causal modeling part describing the more likely starting ideas and design plans used to create a circuit. Knowledge structures can be used to tackle new applications, identify opportunities to improve existing circuits, and validate design correctness. A case study illustrates the proposed knowledge structure for a set of 30 modern, high-frequency analog circuits.

AB  - The marked range shifts seen with global warming suggest that ranges are limited by temperature. Other findings, however, suggest winter survival is directly tied to food availability. We studied Carolina wrens Thryothorus ludovicianus at the northern edge of their range to understand the roles of temperature and food in limiting this species. We established 21 transects over 3 habitats (residential, city park, and rural) with varying degrees of human influence on temperature and food supply. The three habitat types showed variations in wren density, temperature, and feeder presence. While wren densities showed similar seasonal patterns in all habitats, significantly higher densities of birds were observed in the city park and residential habitats. Post-winter densities of Carolina wrens were predicted by the presence of bird feeders, and not by January mean minimum temperatures. Our findings suggest the winter range limits for endotherms is more directly related to food supply, and only indirectly related to temperature. Therefore supplemental feeding and other changes in food supply may modify the range shifts predicted from temperature changes alone.

AB  - PurposeOrganizations have released the importance of lean manufacturing practices (LMPs) and total quality management (TQM) in enhancing competitiveness. However, the implementation of LMPs and TQM becomes more complex when discerning the environmental sustainability position. The complexity stems from the fact that LMPs and TQM are more intricate because of cultural differences. Thus, this study aims to tackle the aforementioned phenomenon by investigating the impact of LMPs and TQM on environmental sustainability moderated by quality culture. Design/methodology/approachA survey was distributed among small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Jordan; thus, 315 valid responses were received. Partial least square structural equation modelling was used to analyze the data and test hypotheses. FindingsThe findings showed that environmental sustainability was significantly impacted by all the LMP practices except Kanban and all the TQM practices except statistical process control. Moreover, quality culture significantly and negatively moderated the relationship between TQM and environmental sustainability. However, the influence of LMPs on environmental sustainability was not significantly moderated by quality culture. Practical implicationsThis study has implications for policymakers in SMEs, supply chain managers and academics regarding the importance of LMPs and TQM systems for implementing environmental sustainability and the role of quality culture. Social implicationsThis study provides guidelines for decision-makers on the pathways that enable them to sustain the environment to safeguard the natural ecosystem and natural resources for upcoming generations. Originality/valueThe originality of this study stems from the alignment of LMPs and TQM in enhancing environmental sustainability, taking into consideration the role of quality culture in SMEs, where previous studies failed short to investigate this phenomenon.

AB  - China has pledged to peak its carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. A crucial aspect of this commitment involves transitioning from coal-dependent activities primarily concentrated in certain regions pivotal to local economies, employment, and livelihoods. High-quality development necessitates identifying just transition strategies for these coal-intensive regions, ensuring inclusive benefits from the energy transition. These regions exhibit disparities in economic and industrial growth, with many low-income mining communities and inadequate public services. This calls for comprehensive policy interventions in economic, energy, societal, and environmental domains. This study aims to delineate just transition strategies for China's coal regions, considering their unique challenges and circumstances. Initially, this article reviews the evolution of "just transition" as a concept and its policy implications. Subsequently, it explores China's approach to achieving carbon neutrality through the lens of just transition, delving into the local economy's reliance on coal-related industries and the impact on employment. Following a clear delineation of the vision for just transition in China, the analysis focuses on identifying principles and pathways for transition. The goal is to propose nuanced and effective policies to ensure just outcomes in the context of China's energy transition.

AB  - Although substantial information had been generated on the effects of land use change on soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) storage, studies are absent on multifactorial effects of land use types, land use age, and elevation on SOC and TN storage. SOC and TN were therefore investigated in 30 field sites comprising natural forests, planted forests, shrub, and grasslands. SOC and TN stocks differed and correlated significantly with land use age; the C stocks correlates significantly with land use change compared the TN stocks. However, there was no relation between the C and N stocks with elevation, implying that SOC and TN are solely dependent on land use age. SOC sequestration potentials of the sampled ecosystems were 345.86, 293.19, 266.45, and 251.23 t ha(-1) for the natural forests, planted forests, shrub, and grasslands with total mean value of 289.18 t.ha(-1) (1,060.42 t.ha(-1) CO(2-)eq). A significant SOC stock loss (17.96%, 29.80%, and 37.66%) occurred in converting natural forests to planted forests, shrub, and grasslands, whereas gains (27.36%, 14.31%, and 5.71%) would occur in reconverting grassland to natural forests, planted forests, and shrublands. Therefore, the C that was lost during deforestation and conversion of natural forests into other land use types could not match the carbon gains thereafter. Our results suggest that land use change and land use age have influenced soil C and N stocks. Moreover, natural forests are better in ecological conservation and restoration of degraded lands. This study provides baseline information for C and N management in ecologically restored and degraded lands.

AB  - High-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes were recently proposed for 1-85 in Atlanta, Georgia, as a way to relieve congestion and to provide a reliable commute time for single-occupant drivers who are willing to pay a toll. It is important to evaluate the air quality impacts of such a proposal in the context of environmental regulations, such as the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and transportation conformity regulations. Several factors affect mass vehicle emissions, such as vehicle activity, speed, age distributions, and class distributions. These factors are incorporated into a base scenario that models the current conditions on 1-85 with high-occupancy vehicle lanes by using data collected in the corridor during the summer of 2007, and a future scenario that models the implementation of HOT lanes on this corridor by using information from cities that already have HOT lanes. The MOBILE-Matrix modeling tool, recently developed by the Georgia Institute of Technology, is used for the emissions analysis by means of the input factors described above. It calculates mass emissions for five pollutants: hydrocarbons (HQ, oxides of nitrogen (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 mu m or smaller (PM2.5), and PM10 (with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 mu m or smaller) as a function of fleet composition and on-road operating conditions. The modeling work predicts extremely small increases in mass emissions for NOx, CO, PM2.5, and PM10, and an extremely small decrease in mass emissions for HC. In addition, the postimplementation emissions changes fall well within the motor vehicle emissions budgets for the facility that are used in air quality planning. Therefore, implementation of HOT lanes on 1-85 in Atlanta should not violate the emissions budget requirements of the federal Transportation Conformity Rule. For NEPA purposes, this analysis could be used to make the case that air quality impacts are not significant, and therefore further detailed analyses are not required.

Design/methodology/approach - The data for this study were collected by administering a survey, and well-defined scales were used for quantifying the data. Theories propounded by various authors were used to form the theoretical framework of the study while keeping those theories relevant to the Indian context. The study uses structural equation modelling to empirically test proposed hypothesis and research model of the relationships. Findings - The results indicated that MO has a positive influence on marketing capabilities, including product development, communication, channel linking and pricing. The study also found, albeit with exceptions, a positive association between marketing capabilities and sustainable innovation. These exceptions were communication capability on technical innovations and channel linking capability on nontechnical innovations. In addition, findings reveal that marketing capabilities fully mediate MO to performance link while sustainable consumption partially mediates the relation between sustainable innovation and competitive advantage. Competitive advantage also partially mediates marketing capabilities to performance relationship. Research limitations/implications - This study deals with four marketing capabilities only and uses cross-sectional data, instead of longitudinal data, that comprises data of 192 service firms in India. Originality/value - The study sets forth empirical evidence for the argument that specific marketing capabilities lead to sustainable innovation. The study further clarifies contributions of marketing capabilities, sustainable consumption and competitive advantage as mediators in the proposed research model.

AB  - This study deals with the possible range of life cycle greenhouse gas emissions (LC-GHG) from acetylated cellulose nanofiber-reinforced polylactic acid (AcCNF/PLA) production processes, considering future scaling-up, process improvement, and variations in their process modeling and simulation. The chemical and mechanical processes required for breaking down aggregated natural cellulose into nanofibers and kneading as cellulose nanofiber-reinforced plastic are under development in lab or pilot scale; to assess future environmental performance, we estimated process inventories in future possible industrial processes for prospective life cycle assessment. It was found that both the pulp acetylation process and the mechanical kneading process makes up a large percentage of LC-GHG from AcCNF/PLA production and can be reduced by process improvement in industrialization. Acetic anhydride consumption is dominant in pulp acetylation LC-GHG and can be significantly reduced by installing and optimizing distillation columns for the recovery of excess acetic anhydride and byproduct acetic acid. Power consumption in the mechanical kneading process can also be reduced by increasing the production rate up to industrial scale.

AB  - To promote the green development of building materials, this study develops a novel and sustainable method for incorporating coconut-derived biochar (BC) in supersulfated cement (SSC). Moreover, the solid waste desulfurized gypsum is used as a sulfate activator. The macroscopic experimental results show that the addition of 2 % biochar can reduce the fluidity of composites by 12.5 % but increase the 28-day compressive and flexural strength by 10.3 % and 19.1 %, respectively. Hydration heat analysis show that biochar can increase the maximum heat release of SSC. XRD patterns and TGA analysis indicate that 2 % biochar can improve the hydration degree of cement where the bound water content is increased by 8.9 %. SEM observations and 1H NMR spectrum suggest that although biochar can compact the microstructure, it increases the harmful and multiple harmful pores ratio. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis considering greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, cost, fluidity, and mechanical properties is performed to evaluate the BC-SSC composites. The results prove that BC-modified SSC has significantly lower environmental pollution and resource consumption than ordinary Portland cement, but the cost may be increased.

AB  - We analyze the long-run relationship between energy consumption and real gross domestic product (GDP) in Turkey taking into account the size of unrecorded economy. Since in developing countries, mainly due to the unrecorded economic activities, the official GDP is not measured correctly, the investigation of the linkage between energy consumption and official GDP may not give reliable results. In this study, empirical results for the case of Turkey over the period 1970-2005 suggest that there is a long-run equilibrium relationship between the officially calculated GDP and energy consumption. Besides, using the error-correction modeling technique, we find out that unidirectional causality runs from official GDP to energy in both short and long runs. However, when we take into account unrecorded economy, we detect neither cointegration nor causality between energy consumption and true GDR These empirical findings imply that: first, energy conservation policies can be implemented in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions without any adverse effect on the recorded economic activities: second the production function in the unrecorded economy is not stable. Furthermore, economic policies to combat unrecorded economy may not serve as a complement to energy conservation policies. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study evaluates a carbon sequestration project for the three plant species in arid and semiarid regions of Iran. Results show that Haloxylon performed appropriately in the carbon sequestration process during the 6 years of the International Carbon Sequestration Project (ICSP). In addition to a high degree of carbon dioxide sequestration, Haloxylon shows high compatibility with severe environmental conditions and low maintenance costs. Financial and economic analysis demonstrated that the ICSP was justified from an economic perspective. The financial assessment showed that net present value (NPV) (US$1,098,022.70), internal rate of return (IRR) (21.53 %), and payback period (6 years) were in an acceptable range. The results of the economic analysis suggested an NPV of US$4,407,805.15 and an IRR of 50.63 %. Therefore, results of this study suggest that there are sufficient incentives for investors to participate in such kind of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects.

AB  - Financial literacy has emerged as a crucial factor in promoting economic stability and resilience, particularly in Montenegro. With the increasing complexity of financial products and the growing need for individuals to make sound financial decisions, the importance of financial literacy cannot be overstated. This study employs a quantitative, survey-based approach to explore the association between financial literacy levels and measures of economic stability, including savings rates, active debt management, and access to financial products. Data were collected through a representative, two-stage stratified sample of 1000 Montenegrin adults aged 18-79, ensuring comprehensive geographic coverage across all Montenegrin municipalities and balanced representation by gender and age. This stratification enables a detailed analysis of financial literacy trends across the population. Correlation analysis reveals that higher levels of financial literacy are associated with better financial practices, such as increased savings and responsible credit use, thereby enhancing economic resilience at the household level. Moreover, improved financial literacy contributes to sustainability by fostering long-term financial stability, reducing inequalities, and promoting inclusive economic growth. The findings suggest that financial literacy can mitigate the impact of economic shocks, emphasizing the need for policies that promote financial education as a tool for sustainable development. This study contributes to the literature on financial literacy in emerging economies and offers actionable insights for policymakers in Montenegro and similar contexts, highlighting financial education as a pathway to individual and national economic resilience.

A core component of the work undertaken by Nordhaus is the Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and Economy, known as the DICE model. The DICE model is a discrete-time model with two control inputs and is primarily used in conjunction with a particular optimal control problem in order to estimate optimal pathways for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper, we provide a tutorial introduction to the DICE model and we indicate challenges and open problems of potential interest for the systems and control community. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Currently, organizations often take into consideration the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles by following a more inclusive approach together with potential other emerging practices that attract more consumers who have particular affiliations with the environment. This study investigates the influence of social and environmental sustainability awareness practices on impulse buying through a proposed set of hypotheses. The hypothetical model is based on (441) valid responses from Omani buyers via an online research survey. Data were processed using CFA and SEM techniques. Results indicate that social and environmental sustainability awareness has a productive relationship with green trust that strengthens impulse buying. Environmental sustainability awareness positively links with green altruism, which further enhances the impulse. By taking gender as a moderator, it has an encouraging impact on social and environmental sustainability awareness. Environmental sustainability awareness and green altruism have a constructive relationship within males rather than females. Based on the unique connection between sustainability practices and impulse buying, the current study's results indicate that if firms take appropriate steps to implement sustainability practices in their operations, sustainability commitment can promote the environmental and social well-being of consumers and the establishment of trust. Such practices enable companies to achieve their sustainability reporting goals and SDGs. Social and environmental sustainability practices protect from the harmful effects of social and environmental influences in mitigating the uncertainty of consumers' buying behavior. Such productive sustainability practices compel buyers to purchase products impulsively at premium prices. The study strongly recommends policymakers and marketers focusing on environmental and social sustainability awareness and green altruism.

The intervention consisted of context-specific research with women throughout Kenya, leading to adaptations to existing probation tools, followed by pilot implementation of a gender-sensitive approach. The evaluation explores the relevance, effectiveness and sustainability of the intervention and presents opinions of implementing probation officers and sector experts. Findings suggest that the project genuinely broke new ground in terms of research on gender-sensitivity and quality of pre-trial reporting for women. Close adherence to the UN Bangkok Rules means the model and lessons are applicable both domestically and globally.

AB  - BackgroundIn recent decades, there has been a significant transformation in the world of work that is characterized by a shift from traditional manufacturing and managerial capitalism, which offered stable full-time employment, to new forms of entrepreneurial capitalism. This new paradigm involves various forms of insecure, contingent, and non-standard work arrangements. Within this context, there has been a noticeable rise in Self-Employed individuals, exhibiting a wide range of -working arrangements. Despite numerous investigations into the factors driving individuals towards Self-Employment and the associated uncertainties and insecurities impacting their lives and job prospects, studies have specifically delved into the connection between the precarious identity of Self-Employed workers and their overall health and well-being. This exploratory study drew on a 'precarity' lens to make contributions to knowledge about Self-Employed workers, aiming to explore how their vulnerable social position might have detrimental effects on their health and well-being.MethodsDrawing on in-depth interviews with 24 solo Self-Employed people in Ontario (January - July 2021), narrative thematic analysis was conducted based on participants' narratives of their work experiences. The dataset was analyzed with the support of NVIVO qualitative data analysis software to elicit narratives and themes.FindingsThe findings showed that people opt into Self-Employment because they prefer flexibility and autonomy in their working life. However, moving forward, in the guise of flexibility, they encounter a life of precarity, in terms of job unsustainability, uncertainties, insecurities, unstable working hours and income, and exclusion from social benefits. As a result, the health and well-being of Self-Employed workers are adversely affected by anger, anomie, and anxiety, bringing forward potential risks for a growing population.Conclusion and implicationsNeoliberalism fabricates a 'precariat' Self-Employed class. This is a social position that is vague, volatile, and contingent, that foreshadows potential threats of the health and wellbeing of a growing population in the changing workforce. The findings in this research facilitate some policy implications and practices at the federal or provincial government level to better support the health and wellbeing of SE'd workers.

AB  - Nitrous oxide is a common choice of labour analgesia in many countries. However, its use is associated with significant cost to the environment as well as potential risks of long-term occupational exposure. Our hospital is one of a small number of healthcare providers in the United Kingdom trialling technology which catalytically destroys ('cracks') nitrous oxide to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and occupational exposure. When used in the setting of inhaled analgesia, cracking technology relies on capturing the patient's exhaled breath via a facemask or mouthpiece, a technique which requires some user skill and may be challenging for patients. In this report, we present the case of a primiparous 35-year-old consultant anaesthetist, who used nitrous oxide cracking technology with inhaled nitrous oxide analgesia (via a facemask) during labour. We present the patient's experiences and discuss the implications of using such technology on ambient nitrous oxide levels in the delivery room. Notably, despite this patient's professional expertise and familiarity with facemask use, nitrous oxide remained detectable throughout her labour, although generally at low levels. This illustrates that whilst this technology has the potential to reduce ambient nitrous oxide levels, its efficacy may vary depending on how it is used, with implications for patient education and support.

AB  - Biodiesel (BD) is often regarded as a carbon-neutral fuel. Many countries are investing resources in biodiesel technology development to respond to the need to improve energy sustainability and the threat of climate change. Since 2009, the South Korean Government has invested a considerable amount of money in developing marine BD (MBD) technology that converts carbon dioxide into diesel using marine microalgae cultivated in large quantities with the help of waste heat from nuclear power plants and/or coal-fired power plants. If the development is successful, 4800 tons of MBD a year, approximately 1820 cars fully fueled annually, will be produced from 2019. Furthermore, the South Korean Government is expected to continue to invest in MBD to improve the market share after 2019. Quantitative information about the public value of MBD technology development is widely demanded by the Government. This study aims to investigate the public value of MBD technology, the attributes of which it considers to be the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the mitigation of air pollutant emissions, new job creation, and the improvement of energy security. A choice experiment (CE) survey of 600 people was conducted during July 2016. The trade-offs among the attributes and the price were evaluated in the survey. The CE data were examined through a multinomial logit model. The marginal values for a 1%p reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, 1%p mitigation of air pollutant emissions, the creation of 100 new jobs, and an improvement of energy security caused by MBD technology development are computed to be KRW 1082.7 (USD 0.9), 918.1 (0.8), and 258.3 (0.2) per household per month, respectively.

AB  - The discovery of biomarkers for assessing soil health requires the exploration of organisms that can explain the core functions of soil and identification of species with major roles in these functions. However, identifying specific keystone markers within the soil microbiota is challenging. Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based molecular-biological methods have revealed information on soil biodiversity; however, whether this biodiversity is related to soil health remains unclear. In this study, we performed NGS on grassland surface soil to compare the prokaryotic and eukaryotic genetic diversity to determine the chemical soil quality and examined markers associated with soil health. Microorganisms associated with the nitrogen cycle, bioremediation, plant pathogenicity, antibiotic production, and material degradation showed potential for use as markers. To propose a framework for soil health assessment, we not only used traditional indicators, such as chemical and physical measures, but also assessed metagenomics data of soil by land use to identify the major factors influencing the microbial structure in soil. Moreover, major keystone species were identified. Furthermore, the microbial genetic diversity of generally healthy surface soil, such as forests, farmland, and parks, was determined. These findings provide basic data for exploring soil health-related biomarkers.

AB  - Stabilization is popularly employed to remediate metal-contaminated soils. It involves the absorption and precipitation of heavy metals to reduce their solubility, movement characteristics, or risk and toxicity. This study aimed to conduct a soil health assessment to determine changes in the health of metal-contaminated soil before and after the application of five stabilizers (acid mine drainage sludge (AMDS), coal mine drainage sludge (CMDS), steel slag, lime, and cement). Soil health assessment, including three soil functions, namely soil productivity, soil stability, and soil biodiversity, evaluated the physical, chemical, and biological indicators (total 16 indicators). Soil health index (SHI) of soil function was calculated by multiplying each indicator score by the weighting factor of each indicator. Total SHI was obtained by summing the three soil-function SHI. Total SHI of the stabilized and test soils followed the order as control soil (1.90) > heavy metal-contaminated soil (1.55) > CMDS-stabilized soil (1.29) > steel slag-stabilized soil (1.29) > AMDS-stabilized soil (1.26) > cement-stabilized soil (0.74) > lime-stabilized soil (0.67). Total SHI of the initial heavy metal-contaminated soil was evaluated as 'normal', before the stabilizer was applied; however, most of the stabilized soils became 'bad' after application of the stabilizers. Furthermore, soils stabilized by cement and lime showed very poor soil health. The results implied that changes in physical and chemical soil properties occurred due to the disturbance caused by the mixing of stabilizers, and ions eluted from the stabilizers could deteriorate soil health further. The findings indicated that soil treated with stabilizers is not suitable for agricultural purposes. Overall, the study suggested that stabilized soil from metal-contaminated sites should be covered with clean soil or monitored for some time before deciding its future agricultural use.

AB  - This study aims to contribute to emerging dialogues on language, sexuality and gender, focusing on the performance and subversion of gender and sexual normativities in a New Zealand sexuality education classroom. In terms of theory, the aim is to focus on New Zealand's outlying, unsettled 'global Southern' status. It also aims to heuristically separate New Zealand from the global North to explore local relationships between sexuality and gender that might otherwise be imperceptible in the glare of globalisation. In two critical incidents, transnational Pasifika boys use language to perform what appears to be sexual fluidity and sexual objectification of the self. A transformation occurs in which a local version of hegemonic masculinity is countered, and the analytical purchase of the concept of heteronormativity becomes questionable in this context. Existing Southern theories from Oceania provide a possible pathway to better understanding the sociolinguistics of gender and sexuality in New Zealand and in the world at large.

AB  - Introduction Intergenerational education mobility, which reflects the degree to which an individual's educational attainment is independent of their parents' education, is essential for promoting equal opportunities in society. In the context of India, where socio-economic disparities are deeply entrenched, understanding the dynamics of intergenerational mobility is particularly crucial.Methods This paper examines various aspects of intergenerational education mobility in India using data from the Indian Human Development Survey (IHDS), a nationally representative multi-topic survey. We analyze intergenerational mobility across different age cohorts and investigate the nonlinearities in the transmission of education. Additionally, we explore the impact of educational inequality, economic growth, and public expenditure on education on mobility outcomes.Results Our analysis reveals a high degree of intergenerational persistence in education, although this persistence has decreased over time. Employing quantile regressions, we observe significant nonlinearities in the relationship between fathers' and sons' educational outcomes across the educational distribution. In particular, we find a widening mobility gap between historically advantaged subgroups (urban populations, upper castes, Hindus) and disadvantaged groups (rural populations, lower castes, Muslims) at the middle and upper quantiles. Moreover, we confirm the "Higher Inequality leading to Lesser Mobility" nexus, supporting the 'Great Gatsby Curve' within the Indian context. Macroeconomic factors, such as economic growth and public expenditure on education, are positively correlated with educational mobility, suggesting that these factors play a critical role in enhancing mobility.Discussion These findings highlight the importance of targeted policy interventions to reduce educational disparities and promote greater intergenerational mobility. The widening mobility gaps between socio-economic and demographic groups emphasize the need for more equitable resource distribution and educational reforms. Future research should explore the multifaceted aspects of intergenerational mobility, incorporating longitudinal studies and regional analyses to deepen our understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

AB  - China's climate and energy policy commitment are stated at the national level, but they may have uneven impacts on the country's regionally heterogeneous transport system. This work quantifies the expected provincial-level response of freight transport to an economywide policy targeting reductions in carbon emissions intensity. The analysis applies the China Regional Energy Model, a multisector, static, global, computable general equilibrium (CGE) model representing 30 individual provinces with physical accounts of energy and greenhouse gas emissions. The structure of road and nonroad freight (and passenger) sectors, the preparation of transport activity data, and a policy similar to announced goals that specify a 17% reduction in the carbon dioxide emissions intensity of gross domestic product are described. In the national aggregate and in most provinces, the road freight sector is most affected by the emissions intensity cap. The road freight sector contributes 24% versus 18% from nonroad freight and 51% from nontransport sectors of a 5.1% reduction in national refined oil demand. Significant regional differences are found in the impacts of a national-level, economywide policy. Steep reductions in freight activity occur in some of the poorest provinces, partly because they offer low-cost abatement opportunities, and the resulting adjustments across the economy affect transport demand. This research contributes a new tool capable of capturing the transport impact of sector- and province-specific policies in detail and providing a rigorous foundation for future dynamic CGE analyses. Potential impacts of energy and climate policy on regional transport systems are important inputs to policy and infrastructure investment decisions at the central and local levels.

AB  - Purpose A profound managerial transformation approach is increasingly designed to unleash the energy and creativity of employees. The purpose of this paper is to observe as the organizations in this sector can use the knowledge sharing to derive maximum efficiency from such crucial volunteers, creating an environment suitable for stimulating the psychological well-being that is the basis of engagement. Design/methodology/approach This exploratory study proposes a model to account the intrinsic and extrinsic motivations to exchange knowledge related to factors that stimulate volunteer's engagement. Findings The results of a survey of 301 volunteers operating in European organizations indicate that influencers of volunteers in a specific domain activated by knowledge sharing can act as sources of creation and can reinforce their identity, sense of belonging and trust in the organization. Research limitations/implications Despite results cannot be generalized because of the samples of convenience, exploratory factor analysis was used to identify the elements for which nonprofit organizations should activate a knowledge-sharing strategy so that engaged volunteers feel like cocreators of values and therefore act as true competitive assets. Originality/value This paper contributes to the expansion of engagement studies through framing the motivations of volunteers in knowledge sharing as a process of social interaction that involves knowledge, experience and expertise and which is able to create an environment suitable to feeding the psychological well-being that is the basis of engagement.

AB  - ObjectivesTo evaluate the implementation and sustainability of the effect of a 1-year Leadership in Education for Neurodevelopmental and related Disabilities (LEND) program in a southeastern state, and to examine its impact on advancing the Maternal Child Health Bureau's (MCHB) Blueprint for Change-a national agenda for pediatric healthcare reform.MethodsThis study applies the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment (EPIS) framework to rigorously evaluate LEND implementation and impact between 2018 and 2022. In-depth interviews (N = 24) were conducted among long-term (1-year) LEND trainees, via Zoom, in a southeastern state. A hybrid approach of deductive and inductive thematic analysis was conducted to identify emergent patterns and themes from trainees' experiences, related to the EPIS constructs and national priorities.ResultsExploration and Preparation. Trainees identified insights from multidisciplinary discussions and family panels as key facilitators to their development. Implementation. Trainees reported growth in confidence and communication and improving their service delivery, including implementation of a collaborative approach to patient care, family-centered care, and occasionally facilitating their obtainment of leadership positions. Trainees also reported systemic barriers to implementation, including time and financial constraints. Sustainability. Trainees identify their experienced shift in mindset and statewide connections as drivers for sustained change, with suggestions for follow-up events and networking opportunities to enhance the effect of LEND training.Conclusions for PracticeThese results may inform LEND objectives to enhance the statewide network and to advance a national framework for prioritizing family well-being and quality of life and access to services.

AB  - Supply chain management is quite important management tool in corporations, however it seem to be more used in small and medium enterprises as well. This research investigates supply chain management in total 613 SMEs of Canada, Iran and Turkey to explore SMEs practices in global context. Results confirmed SCM's determinants, factors, barriers, practices, functioning, environmental and social sustainability statistically significantly differ in contrasting economies while only SCM determinants do not significantly differ for the size of entity. The SMEs' length duration also affected the considered attributes. Apart from SCM determinants all other factors have no significant relationship with the designation whereas types of industry significantly affect the types of practices and functioning within SCM. Lastly, this paper theorizes that the environmental and social sustainability have significant relation with the type of industry.

AB  - Background Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are considered 'contaminants of emerging concern' due to their environmental persistence, bio-accumulative potential, and adverse effects on human health. They are widely employed in producing various goods used in daily life, such as non-stick cookware, cleaning agents, and many industrial applications in aerospace, automotive, construction, electronics, and military, all of which ultimately end up in different environmental matrices. India's rapid economic growth necessitates a comprehensive understanding of its PFAS contamination levels and potential human and ecological exposure. Results The present study reports the quantification of one long-chain and two short-chain perfluoroalkyl acids and three long-chain and two short-chain perfluorosulfonic acids and qualitative analysis using suspect screening in the waters of Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. Samples were collected from surface and groundwater sources, including the Adyar river, Buckingham canal, Chembarambakkam lake, and the water treatment plant. The concentrations analyzed in all the samples ranged from 0.10 ng/L to 136.27 ng/L. Groundwater had some of the highest concentrations of PFAS. L-PFBS (up to 136.27 ng/L) and PFOA (up to 77.61 ng/L) are present in all the samples. The concentrations of all the target PFAS increased in the 5 to 103% range in the final treated water compared to the raw water of the water treatment plant. This treated water is distributed as a source of drinking water for the residents of Chennai. Additionally, the dominance of short-chain compounds (4-7 carbons) over long-chain compounds (> 7 carbons) was observed. Suspect screening revealed numerous precursors and other fluorinated compounds abundantly present in the samples. Conclusions Our study revealed PFAS levels up to 136.27 ng/L in both surface and groundwater samples from Chennai. These findings raise concerns about potential risks to ecosystems and human well-being. The dominance of short-chain PFAS coupled with abundant precursors and unidentified fluorinated compounds indicates an ongoing shift toward alternatives. Conventional water treatment is ineffective in eliminating these chemicals from the water system; rather, increasing the PFAS concentrations from raw water to treated water necessitates advanced polishing steps. Industrial emissions, untreated domestic wastewater discharge, and open dump sites have been suspected as the significant sources of contamination, highlighting the need for further investigation to fully assess the extent of PFAS contamination in Chennai.

AB  - In the contemporary landscape, the foundation of competitive advantage lies in sustainability, particularly within the context of regional competitiveness. This topic explores the impact of sustainability on regional competitiveness. In this study, we assessed experts' opinions on the impact of the main ten key factors of evaluation on regional competitiveness, namely the economy, labor market, poverty and social inclusion, health, education, environmental and energy considerations, transport infrastructure, science and technology, high-tech industries, and innovation. The study aims to understand how these factors influence regional competitiveness. A sample of 93 experts participated in a questionnaire survey through the Google platform from October to December 2023. This methodology was chosen to gather diverse expert opinions efficiently. The collected data were analyzed with statistical tools, combining cross and chi-square tests. Statistical analysis methods such as cross and chi-square tests were employed to analyze the collected data. Our findings indicate that experts recognize the economy (up to a positive level of 69.1%), the labor market (up to 64.7%), and the health infrastructure (up to 52.9%) as the main impact factors on regional competitiveness. Collective efforts and improvements in these factors are essential to alleviate poverty and social exclusion (up to 50.8%). Investments in education (up to 41.9%) and technological science and the digital society (up to 39.2%) are considered key after the main factors to promoting prosperity and competitiveness. Following them, there is a growing call for creating a greener, healthier, and more sustainable future, reflected in the focus on environmental and energy issues (up to 36.7%) and toward transport developments (up to 35.7%). At the bottom of the list are high-tech industry (up to 32.5%) and the innovation factor (up to 28.2%). These factor groups are highlighted as critical aspects for promoting prosperity and addressing social challenges in the region. The findings underscore the multifactorial nature of regional competitiveness, emphasizing both the important and less critical factors. It becomes apparent that the interpretation of regional competitiveness requires a comprehensive analysis of multiple factors, each contributing differently to overall competitiveness. Further examination and analysis are necessary to fully understand these dynamics.

AB  - This study explored on pyrolytic thermal degradation of coconut husk (CH), treated with Ni-Fe electroplating wastewater and Ni-Fe synthetic water, for bioenergy generation. Initially, green coconut husk absorbed solutions resembling electroplating effluent and synthetic Ni-Fe at 105 degrees C. Physiochemical properties of the husk and ICP-MS analysis of water were thoroughly examined before TG/DTG analysis. The impact of catalysts on pyrolysis was assessed through TG/DTG measurement, the obtained results were utilized to study the kinetics and thermodynamic parameters using the iso-conversional approaches (FWO, KAS, Starink) and Criado plots were used to discuss the reaction mechanism. Metal impregnated biomass with wastewater (MICHw) found to have high activation energy compared to that of metal impregnated with synthetic water (MICHs). For MICHw, average activation energies were calculated as 132.22, 151.37, and 149.78 kJ/molefegurefff for FWO, KAS, Starink, respectively, however, for MICHs the values were 114.79, 114.03.71, and 114.75 kJ/mol. The potential energy barrier (6-10 kJ/mol) between activation energy and reaction enthalpy showed a favourable environment for product development. Various experiments on native green coconut husk (NGCH) and impregnated coconut husk under different conditions showed a higher liquid oil yield for MICHw, attributed to the Ni-Fe catalyst at 650 degrees C and smaller particle sizes. This research provides key insights into enhancing bioenergy production through the pyrolytic conversion of impregnated coconut husk, highlighting the pivotal role of wastewater-derived catalysts.

AB  - This paper employs the microdata of the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS-HSE) to discuss the impact of economic factors, such as household income and female wages, and subjective well-being, such as life satisfaction and health condition, on childbirth probability in Russia, which, following a continuous decline in birth rate throughout the 1990s, began to increase in the 2000s, and rose thereafter almost continuously. The following results were obtained: higher household incomes serve to encourage childbirth, while female wages are seen to act by curtailing childbirth, and when indicators such as life satisfaction and health condition are high, the likelihood of childbirth is increased significantly. Most previous research concerning the determinants of the birth rate in Russia has shown that household income has no effect at all, but the findings in this paper suggest that this may have been due to the special circumstances that existed at the beginning of the economic transformation period in the 1990s.

AB  - With the goal of achieving sustainable development, many studies have been performed on approaches to reducing environmental load and cutting construction-related waste and greenhouse gas emissions. For this reason, this study aims to reduce carbon emissions and preserve the fixed materials such as limestone by utilizing the presumably high value-added cementitious powder of waste concrete, which is not currently being recycled. First, the chemical properties of cementitious powder were analyzed to manufacture recycled carbonic cement by deriving the optimal mix proportion of the materials using the industrial byproduct (former slag) and limestone as a property adjustment. To make a clinkering evaluation, Free CaO measurement, an XRD analysis, a thermal analysis, a compressive strength test and a flowability analysis were performed. Through this series of analyses, overall properties were found to be at 80% those of OPC or better. In addition, when using the cementitious powder as a substitute for limestone, it was discovered that the carbon emissions were reduced by up to 46%. However, as the amount of fine aggregate that was not separated from the cementitious powder due to its similar grain size and shape increased, the plasticity and the reduction in carbon emissions were radically decreased. Moreover, when the fine aggregate was mixed in the proportion of more than 30%, it is believed to be hardly materialized. Therefore, an effective separation technology of cementitious powder from fine aggregate should be researched and developed in the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study evaluates the possibility of reducing drying costs by screening large particles prior to drying and pelletizing them with the dried medium size and fine particles. Four feedstocks with different shares of fibers (> 3.15 mm) and fines (< 1 mm) were conditioned at 12 and 24% water content (wc). Bulk density, durability, length and water sorption behavior of the pellets were evaluated. Transport costs, energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission equivalents were calculated. The combustion behavior was correlated to the particle size distribution of the feedstock. The 24%(wc) feedstock pellets (P-24) showed a low durability (<(x)over bar> = 79%). The P24 with the highest share of large particles showed the highest durability ((x) over bar = 89%). Large particles caused pellets with high durability and fines caused pellets with low durability. All P-12 had lower transport costs, lower energy consumption and lower greenhouse gas emissions in comparison to the P-24, because their bulk density was higher (619 kg x m(-3) and 362 kg x m(-3), respectively). The combustion parameters of the P-12 were affected by the feedstock particle size distribution. The Fpsd with the highest share of particles in the range of 3.15-6.30 mm showed the highest durability ((x) over bar = 98.5%) and the lowest CO emissions ((x) over bar = 280 mg/m(3)). The calculated costs for a combined screening/drying process were lower than the costs for conventional drying. A new production concept is proposed: Large particles can be screened before drying and can be mixed with the dried medium/small size particles for pelletization.

AB  - Evaluation of U.S. agricultural policy reform is complicated by the interaction of price support programs and production constraints. Researchers have typically presumed that price support policies within the U.S. wheat program increase the producer incentive at the margin, however, little work has been done to determine whether such a presumption is warranted by the data. The results of this research indicate that price support, conditioned on production constraint, has not increased U.S. production. Furthermore. the combined effect of price support and production control within a voluntary system is shown to increase U.S. supply response with respect to market price. Given these results, opposition to certain aspects of U.S. agricultural policy, in regions such as the EC and the Cairns Group, for example, may be misguided.

AB  - In September 2015, the United Nations launched the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, followed by the adoption of the 'Space2030' Agenda in October 2021, highlighting the importance of space and Earth Observation (EO) data in monitoring progress towards these goals. This research examines the benefits of EO evolution, spurred by New Space initiatives, within socioeconomic sustainability and development. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are introduced to assess the socioeconomic impacts related to Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG8) targets 8.2 and 8.3. Findings show that the EO evolution enhances job opportunities (KPI1) and increases job deployment rates per investment (KPI2). Furthermore, this trend democratises access to the space market, significantly boosting participation of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) (KPI3).

AB  - Land use conflicts (LUCs) arise during land use change, causing an uncoordinated spatial structure of the land and negatively affecting the synergistic development of multifunctionality, especially in mountain cities. Previous studies have focused on identifying and measuring land use structural conflicts (LUSC), with less attention paid to land use functional conflicts (LUFC), and a lack of simulation for future multi-scenarios. Thus, taking Chongqing as an example, based on the perspective of LUSC-LUFC coupling, this study constructed a comprehensive conflict index to identify and assess LUCs, then applied the PLUS model to predict LUCs under three development scenarios in 2030. This study found that (1) there was a significant positive spatial association between LUSC and LUFC, with high-high agglomeration types in areas of severe LUCs and low-low agglomeration types in areas of light LUCs. (2) During 2000-2020, the LUCs in Chongqing displayed a trend of upward and then downward from 2000 to 2020, with significant agglomeration in their spatial pattern. (3) Two typical areas of LUCs intensification were identified, namely the topographic transition zone located in the Daba and Wuling mountains and the urban-rural interface in the Chongqing metropolitan area. (4) In 2030, the LUCs in Chongqing manifest an overall mitigation in the ecological protection (EP) scenario, while displaying an intensification in the natural development (ND) and economic development (ED) scenarios. Based on the types of spatial interaction between LUSC and LUFC, land use optimization strategies were formulated. The findings will provide scientific references for sustainable land use management decisions in Chongqing and other mountainous cities.

AB  - Land-use changes under the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) and the representative concentration pathways (RCPs) have been analyzed globally, but how regional and national land use respond to the global mitigation policies is seldom explored, which poses difficulties in regional environmental adaptation and decision-making. China, as a major food consuming and biofuel production country, would suffer great uncertainties in future land-use dynamics under the global scenarios. Here, we present a scenario-based land-use change assessment framework, integrating Global Change Assessment Model and Future Land Use Simulation Model, to evaluate the potential land use projections of China from 2010 to 2100. Eight scenarios with different combinations of SSPs and radiative forcing targets of RCPs are designed, to analyze the impacts of the global socioeconomic and emission assumptions on regional mitigations and land-use changes. We recalibrated the historical land use data and urban dynamics of China to improve the consistency of modeling results with the actual regional changes. Meanwhile, differences in land use dynamics are demonstrated by spatial downscaling, which are jointly affected by the global assumptions and local driving factors, showing a fierce competition between the crop and forest. We find that the regional crop changes are sensitive to the socioeconomic dynamics as well as the bioenergy production, while different carbon regimes drive the forest changes in unexpected ways. Besides, overall heterogeneous landscape patterns and similar spatial suitability maps are found in distributions of land-use change between the emission and socioeconomic scenarios. The results indicate that this framework embedded with the consideration of anthropogenic managements as well as the detailed interactions of local environments provides an effective way to investigate regional land use response to a range of alternative future pathways.

AB  - Avian scavengers are declining throughout the world, and are affected by a large number of threats such as poisoning, electrocution, collision with man-made structures, direct persecution, changes in agricultural practices, landscape composition, and sanitary regulations that can reduce food availability. To formulate effective conservation strategies, it is important to quantify which of these factors has the greatest influence on demographic parameters such as territory occupancy and breeding success, and whether quantitative models can be transferred across geographic regions and political boundaries. We collated territory and nest monitoring data of the endangered Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus in the Balkans to understand the relative influence of various factors on population declines. We monitored occupancy in 87 different territories and breeding performance of 405 territory-monitoring years between 2003 and 2015, with an overall territory occupancy rate of 69% and a mean productivity of 0.80 fledglings per occupied territory. We examined which of 48 different environmental variables were most influential in explaining variation in territory occupancy and breeding success in Bulgaria and Greece, and tested whether these models were transferrable to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Territory occupancy and breeding success were affected by a wide range of environmental variables, each of which had a small effect that may not be the same across political boundaries. Both models had reasonably good discriminative ability [area under the receiver-operated characteristic curve (AUC) for territory occupancy = 0.871, AUC for breeding success = 0.744], but were unsuccessful in predicting occupancy or breeding success in the external validation data set from a different country, possibly because the most influential factors vary geographically. Management focussing on a small number of environmental variables is unlikely to be effective in slowing the decline of Egyptian Vultures on the Balkan Peninsula. We recommend that in the short term the reduction of adult mortality through the enforcement of anti-poison laws, and in the long term the adoption of large-scale landscape conservation programs that retain or restore historical small-scale farming practices may benefit vultures and other biodiversity.

AB  - Recently, in addition to the popular concept of "ecosystem services" (ES), the term "landscape services" (LS) has come into use. We are examining the question of whether a stronger focus on LS would be useful, particularly with regard to case studies carried out in Germany. Important reasons for introducing the term LS include the prominent role of spatial aspects, the reference to landscape elements and the landscape character, and the relevance of LS for landscape planning. We found no strong arguments for replacing the concept of ES by LS; however, we do prefer a situation-related use of both concepts. We propose the following definition: Landscape services are the contributions of landscapes and landscape elements to human well-being.

AB  - Policy makers, economists and water researchers have advocated water transfer and trade as a key potential response to worldwide water scarcity and/or efficiency problems. This paper examines aspects of an operational irrigation scheme in New Zealand that enables transfer of water between shareholders, arguing that the set-up and processes involved with the scheme can provide a wider context for analysis and consideration of social and cultural issues involved with resource allocation. Analysis of the key drivers and barriers for water reveal that while there is potential for real benefits from transferring water for farmers and the community, an examination of some of the processes used, and barriers to transfer reveals important lessons for planning and regulatory perspectives, including the importance of looking at the issues from a procedural and distributive justice viewpoint.

AB  - Biomass-derived synthetic jet fuel with low net greenhouse gas emissions can help decarbonize aviation. Demonstration projects are required to show technical feasibility and give confidence to investors in large commercial-scale deployments. Most previous literature focuses on assessing future commercial-scale systems, for which performance and costs will differ considerably from demonstration projects. Here, a detailed analysis is presented for a first-of-a-kind demonstration plant that would be built in the Southeastern US. The plant, which cogasifies biomass and lignite and captures CO2 prior to Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, was designed and simulated using Aspen Plus. The process heat recovery system was designed using a systematic optimization method. Lifecycle analysis was used to assess net greenhouse gas emissions. Capital and operating cost estimates were developed in collaboration with a major engineering firm. The plant produces 1252 barrels per day (80% jet fuel), exports 15 MWe (net), and has a net energy efficiency of 35.8% (lower heating value). Captured CO2 (1326 t/d) is sold for use in enhanced oil recovery. With biomass coming from sustainably-managed pine plantations, net lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions are well below those for petroleum jet fuel. The estimated range of capital required to build the plant is 3875-5762 $/kW(th) of feedstock input (2015$). As expected for a small demonstration designed to minimize technological risks, subsidies are required for the jet fuel product to compete with petroleum jet fuel. Technology innovations, learning via construction and operating experience, and larger plant scales will improve the economics of future commercial plants.

AB  - Although the social movement that crossed race, class, sexuality and gender lines before 2008 was exemplary, there is now another type of social movement that has emerged. This movement, led by conservative right wing groups, has been stirring racial divisions by using the economic crisis to scapegoat immigrants. At the same time, the promises of the Obama Administration have not been kept. Instead, under this administration's immigration policies close to one million deportations have occurred nationally, the implementation of a Secure Communities program has led to arbitrary arrests for minor offenses and violated the due process rights of both citizens and noncitizens, and an existing program of employee immigration-status verification has led to as many as 19,000 people that have been mistakenly identified as being deportable. The ingredients of a social movement are still visible but the strategies have shifted to local organizing efforts that, in California, have resulted in legislation supporting: cities opting out of E-Verify, the right of AB540 students to attend college with financial aid, the right of people without a driver's license to stop the impounding of their cars, and the establishment of a pilot program designed to protect undocumented workers who pay state income taxes. This paper focuses on these various trends and the prospects for future systemic change.

AB  - Eco-driving has well-known positive effects on fuel economy and greenhouse-gas emissions. Moreover, eco-driving reduces road-traffic noise, which is a serious threat to the health and well-being of many people. We investigated the psychological predictors of the adoption of eco-driving from the perspective of road-traffic noise abatement. The data came from 890 car drivers who participated in a longitudinal survey over four months. Specifically, we tested the effects of the intention to prevent road-traffic noise, variables derived from the theory of planned behavior (social norm, perceived behavioral control, and attitude), and variables derived from the health action process approach (implementation intention, maintenance self-efficacy, and action control) on the intention to practice eco-driving and on eco-driving behavior. The intention to prevent road-traffic noise was not linked to the intention to practice eco-driving. The strongest predictors of the intention to practice eco-driving were attitude and perceived behavioral control. The strongest predictor of eco-driving behavior was action control. The link between behavioral intention and behavior was weak, indicating that drivers have difficulties putting their intention to practice eco-driving into action. Therefore, intervention efforts should directly address and support the transition from intention to behavior. This could be accomplished by providing reminders, which help to maintain behavioral intention, and by providing behavior feedback, which helps car drivers to monitor their behavior.

AB  - Rhodolith beds can contribute large amounts of CaCO3 to coastal environments, playing an important role in Carbon sequestration. The spatial distribution of rhodoliths is a consequence of their sensitivity to light intensity, currents, wave action, sedimentation rates, and salinity, whereas mesophotic, low sedimentation quiescent conditions are optimal. Although there is evidence of a clear relationship between hydrodynamics and rhodolith morphology and mobility, there are few studies relating wave action and rhodolith mobility. We aim to assess the mobility potential by waves, of the rhodoliths of the Abrolhos Shelf (Brazil), that contains the largest rhodolith field in the world. Based on the local wave climate and its propagation through the shelf, the rhodolith mobility potential was evaluated. Rhodolith mobility potential distribution is directly related to shelf morphology and incoming waves characteristics. Despite being restricted to deeper areas of the shelf (>20 m), rhodoliths in the area are mobilized by wave action, especially from the more energetic waves associated with storms. Waves can mobilize rhodoliths in the area, with mobility potential distribution being controlled by shelf morphology and seasonal wave climate. Largest areas of mobilization are observed during energetic waves conditions associated to the passage of cold fronts.

AB  - This research explores associations between land use types and young offender residential location in the Regional Municipality of York, Ontario, Canada, at a small-area level. Employing a Bayesian spatial modelling approach, we found that after controlling for socio-economic risk factors, proportion of open area land use was positively associated, and road density negatively associated, with residential location of young offenders. Map decomposition, which visualises the contribution of each risk factor to total young offender risk, demonstrated that open area land use contributed more risk in rural areas than urban, and that road density contributed less risk in urban areas than rural. We propose explanations for these results focused on social disorganisation theory and accessibility to structured leisure activities and apply findings to inform law enforcement and land use planning. Results provide a criminological perspective not often considered in planning and urban studies research and contrast land use policies generally motivated by public health and the environment.

AB  - While sustainable land use planning ensures land preservation through urban compactness, liveable residential environments are commonly associated with low density levels. Analyzing the relationships between density and neighborhood satisfaction (as a measure for liveability) may therefore help urban planners to offer sustainable infill projects that also guarantee liveability for the residents. Objective or subjective measures of density can be proposed. While the literature considering objective density is plentiful, the empirical work analyzing the relationships between density perception and neighborhood satisfaction is surprisingly scarce. In this study, we use a 2015 online survey in the Loire-Atlantique Departement in France that provided 1,134 questionnaires, which we analyzed using a discrete choice experiment. We find that neighborhood satisfaction has no relationship to the perceived density of the built environment by individuals. What matters is peacefulness as another type of neighborhood perception. Healthcare accessibility is also valued by the residents.

AB  - This article investigates how regulated automakers and upstream component suppliers comply with "technology-forcing" regulations, or laws that set performance standards beyond their usual technological capabilities. In particular, this article examines how firms manage and organize their research and development (R&D) processes concerning automobile emissions control technologies amid the uncertainties resulting from the issuance of new regulations This study involves the analyses of patents, interviews with experts, references to technical papers published for conferences of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), and use of learning curves The results of this study show that the high regulatory standards under the technology-forcing regulation played an important role in forcing technological innovations and determining subsequent direction of technological change Component suppliers were important sources of innovation in the 1970s, but over the course of technological evolution, automakers gradually emerged as the locus of innovation This study also shows that firms strategically manage architectural and component knowledge in the presence of uncertainties about their technological capacity to meet new auto emissions control standards (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study investigates urban poverty in Seoul, South Korea, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on housing and economic challenges. Employing principal component analysis, clustering algorithms, and visualization techniques, it analyzes archived data to uncover disparities in housing conditions and economic well-being across Seoul. The research reveals significant socio-economic divisions, with over 75% of the city's areas marked by vulnerability, indicating widespread poverty or the concentration of economically disadvantaged populations. This highlights the pervasive nature of poverty and the precarious situation of the urban poor, who are at risk due to fragile living conditions. The findings advocate for inclusive urban development strategies that prioritize the needs of marginalized groups, suggesting a shift from focusing solely on economic growth to ensuring equitable welfare for all residents.

AB  - This review examines recent literature on economic impacts, vulnerabilities and adaptation to climate change in coastal cities and regions of the developed world. Major areas of focus within this body of literature include study of the economic impacts of extreme events, examination of the economic consequences of sea level rise, and investigation of the multiple factors that influence economic vulnerability and resilience. Despite blossoming interest in the local and regional economic dimensions of climate change, the majority of work on this topic is focused on coastal cities and regions in the Global North. This work is also largely conducted outside the field of economic geography in disciplines that include natural hazards, economics, planning, and human dimensions of global environmental change, among others. While these studies have made important contributions to knowledge about how climate change may affect developed coastal cities and regions, there is substantial room for new engagement by economic geographers. In addition to a clear need for more work on the Global South, areas where economic geographers seem especially well-positioned to contribute include comprehensive assessments of coastal economic impacts which incorporate both market and non-market measures, investigation of the effects of climate change on patterns of growth and spatial inequality across coastal and related inland areas, and development of new theoretical understandings of how changing environmental baselines may influence regional economic growth and decline.

AB  - Greenhouse gas emissions are stagnating in Germany despite increasing deployment of renewable energy. This makes the government's Energiewende appear inconsistent and has triggered a discussion on phasing-out coal. The focus has thus turned from niche technology development to the destabilization of the existing high-carbon regime. In this paper we investigate stakeholders' framings and their perceptions of different policy options to advance the understanding of regime destabilization processes and theory-building in the context of the multilevel perspective (MLP) on socio-technical transitions. We find that actors still form coalitions with traditional allies and cling to established lines of reasoning, although there are indications for a beginning disintegration of the status quo-defending coalition. In their framings, core actors emphasize risks and threats. This confirms that regime destabilization is particularly conflictual and shows that for actors pushing regime change it is more difficult to offer a positive story. Linking policies for phasing-out incumbent technologies to accompanying measures for managing structural change in affected regions may facilitate compromise. The results moreover point to a tension between national and supranational action as a core issue in destabilization debates. Our insights are relevant for countries in similar transition phases and may inform future comparative research.

AB  - Balkan countries in the process of joining the European Union shall adopt greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets and implement appropriate mitigation policies and measures. This paper presents a simplified methodological framework based on marginal abatement cost curves for estimating the technical and economic mitigation potential at sectoral level (buildings and road transport) in selected Balkan countries. The results of the analysis provide to decision makers useful information regarding the availability of background data, the potential for setting ambitious mitigation targets, and detailed tools for assisting the selection of policies and measures to meet these targets. The analysis performed shows that a significant part of the greenhouse gas emissions abatement potential can be achieved through win-win measures. The incorporation of environmental externalities associated with these interventions, estimated through benefits transfer, further improves the economic performance of these measures, especially in the buildings sector. Moreover, the implementation of these measures is shown to result in positive macroeconomic effects through increases in GDP (gross domestic product) and creation of new jobs. Finally, the rebound effect may restrict the estimated greenhouse gas emission reductions in the buildings of the countries examined due to the low energy performance of the existing building stock.

AB  - The department was commissioned to investigate the possibilities for animal-fat combustion in industrial steam generators operating originally on fuel-oil or natural gas. There are two main reasons for operating generators on animal fat as a fuel: On one hand, this material is considered as hazardous waste, thus an important goal is its environmentally benign elimination or disposal. On the other hand, fat is an excellent energy source and can be used as combustion fuel. This way fossil fuel usage can be saved while environmental regulations can also be met. The usage of animal fat as a fuel for furnaces required classification according to fuel classification rules, and comparison with the properties of fuel oil. In addition, its pollutant content was determined and the effects on the combustion process and emission were investigated. Finally the savings in fossil fuel energy consumption and related CO(2) emission achieved were determined. The first stage involved the determination of the composition of animal fat. Subsequently other properties such as viscosity and flash point variation were investigated. These data were compared to the properties of fuel oil. The theoretical investigations of animal-fat classification were promising. Initially one steam generator, originally designed for fuel oil combustion, was modified and fitted with a parallel animal fat fuel supply system. The results of the test were encouraging, although there were some problems with power regulation and later with fuel supply. A rotary cup type burner was then fitted to the boiler. Using this system, all the requirements including environmental regulations were met.

AB  - In recent years, the field of plant immunity has witnessed remarkable breakthroughs. During the coevolution between plants and pathogens, plants have developed a wealth of intricate defense mechanisms to safeguard their survival. Newly identified immune receptors have added unexpected complexity to the surface and intracellular sensor networks, enriching our understanding of the ongoing plant-pathogen interplay. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms of resistosome shapes our understanding of these mysterious molecules in plant immunity. Moreover, technological innovations are expanding the horizon of the plant-pathogen battlefield into spatial and temporal scales. While the development provides new opportunities for untangling the complex realm of plant immunity, challenges remain in uncovering plant immunity across spatiotemporal dimensions from both molecular and cellular levels.

AB  - In the context of increasing focus on social sustainability, neighborhood rehabilitation has emerged as a crucial component of global urban renewal initiatives. Distinct from most renewal paradigms that are usually one-offs, neighborhood rehabilitation is a long-term endeavor that requires ongoing resident participation to effectively address diverse needs, investment shortages, and governance challenges. Extant research predominantly focuses on residents' initial engagement, leaving the dynamics of continued participation and its influencing factors largely unexamined. Employing the Expectation-Confirmation Model (ECM), this study explores how residents' initial participation experiences influence their intentions to continue participation. Analyzing questionnaire responses from 367 experienced residents in Wuhan, China, the study finds that a mere 38.2 % of residents exhibit re-engage intention. Path analysis shows that initial participation experience influences residents' reengage intention indirectly through participation satisfaction and perceived usefulness. Residents' re-engage intention is most influenced by level of influence residents hold in decision-making, followed by type of activities they engage in, and stage of their initial involvement. As an exploratory study into the realm of continued participation, this research uncovers several potential pathways and policy recommendations, aiming to ease residents' transition from initial acceptance to sustained engagement in future neighborhood development efforts.

AB  - Riparian deforestation is a major threat to the ecological integrity of streams and aquatic biodiversity, influencing microhabitat availability and susceptibility to disturbances. Here we tested if riparian deforestation of tropical streams influenced beta diversity of macroinvertebrate assemblages, by comparing indices that weighted differentially rare and dominant taxa, and testing if nestedness in community composition increased in deforested streams. Within-stream beta diversity was higher in deforested than forested streams, mainly due to taxon loss and higher dominance. In disturbed streams, higher sedimentation in pool mesohabitats resulted in larger differences in community composition, whereas mesohabitats in forested streams were more stable.

AB  - The production of ammonia via the Haber-Bosch process consumes large amounts of fossil fuels and releases large amounts of greenhouse gases. Ammonia has many important applications including fertilizer for crops and for microalgae-derived biofuel systems. Aquatic cyanobacteria fix nitrogen from the air and have been mass-cultured for many uses. This study analyzes, on a life cycle basis, a process to culture the cyanobacterium, Anabaena sp. ATCC 33047, in open ponds; harvest the biomass and exopolysaccharides and convert these to biogas; strip and convert the ammonia from the biogas residue to ammonium sulfate; dry the ammonium sulfate solution to ammonium sulfate crystals; transport the ammonium sulfate and convert it to liquid ammonia and concentrated sulfuric acid. When compared to the ammonia produced via the Haber-Bosch process, savings of about 1.0 x 10(5) MJ of non-renewable energy and 3100 kg CO2 equivalent of global warming potential per 1000 kg of liquid ammonia might be possible. The results are robust and are not sensitive to the model parameters. The proposed system, if implemented, might have a significant impact on many important global issues such as global warming, fossil fuel depletion, and food security.

AB  - This paper presents the findings of a life cycle assessment (LCA) of electricity generated from the combustion of sugar cane bagasse in Mauritian sugar mills. The study arose from the identification of the need for to provide data for the development of an LCA profile for the electricity mix in Mauritius. The system is limited geographically to the island of Mauritius and is intended to be the representative of current agricultural techniques practiced and current manufacturing processes used by Mauritian sugar mills. The unit operations that make up the system are the growing and harvesting of sugar cane, the transport of the harvested cane to sugar mills, the production of bagasse as a by-product from the sugar milling process, and the combustion of bagasse to generate heat and electricity. The functional unit of the study is the generation of I GWh of electricity exported to the national electricity grid. The characterised data for I GWh of bagasse-derived electricity were compared with data for I GWh of coal-derived electricity, using the same set of characterisation factors. The results of this comparison indicate that bagasse-derived electricity performs well in the areas of greenhouse gas emissions, acidification, and non-renewable energy inputs, but performs poorly in relation to water consumption and eutrophication.

AB  - This study assessed the available status of waste management system in Ahvaz and its impact on the environment, as well as seven other scenarios in order to quantitatively calculate potential environmental impacts by utilizing the life cycle assessment (LCA) method. These scenarios were as follows: scenario 1: landfilling without biogas collection; scenario 2: landfilling with biogas collection; scenario 3: composting and landfilling without biogas collection; scenario 4: recycling and composting; scenario 5: composting and incineration; scenario 6: anaerobic digestion, recycling, and landfilling; scenario 7: anaerobic digestion and incineration. Emissions were calculated by the integrated waste management (IWM) model and classified into five impact categories: resource consumption, global warming, acidification potential, photochemical oxidation, and eco-toxicity. In terms of resource consumption and the depletion of non-renewable resources, the third scenario showed the worst performance due to its lack of any recycling, energy recovery, and conversion to energy. In terms of greenhouse gas emissions and the effect on global warming, scenario 1 and scenario 2 showed that disposing the whole amount of waste resulted in the most amount of greenhouse gases produced. Moreover, 50% gas and energy recovery from landfills, in comparison with the non-recovery method, reduced the index of global warming by 12%. Finally, scenarios which were based on producing energy from waste showed a reasonably positive performance in terms of greenhouse gases emissions and the influence on global warming.

AB  - The building sector has gained significant attention due to its remarkably high energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. In China's rural areas, stone is a popular building material, but there are unprece-dented demands to improve the life-cycle performance of stone buildings. It is essential to preserve the original architectural features while evolving towards a cleaner production and operation. This study implements a field survey in the Taihang Mountains of Hebei province. The improvement of stone extraction methods and the evolution of three stone wall styles are collected and developed. Thermal transmittances of three stone walls are measured and modeled. A cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment is conducted, and the results are compared to show their environmental performance in the embodiment and operation phases. Their life cycle inventories, including stone extraction, are developed. One representative building style sample is developed for the cooling and heating energy requirement simulation in the DesignBuilder. Based on the inventories, conducting life cycle impact assessment shows various environmental profiles in their whole life cycles. From the outcomes, the stone cladding wall (SCW) outperforms the other stone walls in both the embodiment and operation phases. However, its relatively high cost is a challenge for an individual house owner. This study proves the SCW is more sus-tainable, providing a basis for the choice of stone wall style in the future construction.

AB  - Gas turbine installations (GTIs) are widely used to generate electrical and thermal energy, mainly by burning gaseous fuels. With the development of hydrogen energy technology, a current area of particular interest is the use of GTIs to burn hydrogen. In order to assess the prospects of using GTIs in this way, it is necessary to understand the carbon emissions of gas turbines within the larger context of the entire hydrogen life cycle and its carbon footprint. The article provides an overview of results from previously published studies on life cycle assessment (LCA) of complex technical devices associated with the production and consumption of fuel and energy, which are most similar to GTIs when it comes to the complexity of LCA. The subject of analysis was a set of GTIs located in Russia with a capacity of 16 MW. An assessment of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per MWh of electricity produced showed that at different stages of the GTI life cycle, the total carbon footprint was 198.1-604.3 kg CO2-eq., of which more than 99% came from GTI operation. Greenhouse gas emissions from the production and end-of-life management stages are significantly lower for GTIs compared to those for other complex technical devices used to generate electricity. This is an indicator of the strong prospects for the future use of GTIs.

AB  - Recycling lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) can supplement critical materials and improve the environmental sustainability of LIB supply chains. In this work, environmental impacts (greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, energy consumption) of industrial-scale production of battery-grade cathode materials from end-of-life LIBs are compared to those of conventional mining supply chains. Converting mixed-stream LIBs into battery-grade materials reduces environmental impacts by at least 58%. Recycling batteries to mixed metal products instead of discrete salts further reduces environmental impacts. Electricity consumption is identified as the principal contributor to all LIB recycling environmental impacts, and different electricity sources can change greenhouse gas emissions up to five times. Supply chain steps that precede refinement (material extraction and transport) contribute marginally to the environmental impacts of circular LIB supply chains (<4%), but are more significant in conventional supply chains (30%). This analysis provides insights for advancing sustainable LIB supply chains, and informs optimization of industrial-scale environmental impacts for emerging battery recycling efforts.

AB  - Magnesium (Mg) has a great potential to reduce vehicle weight, fuel consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions. The Chinese Mg industry has developed rapidly since the 1990s. The output of Mg reached 700,000 tons in 2006, accounting for more than 70% of global Mg production. Most of Mg is produced in China through the Pidgeon process that has an intensive energy usage and generates a large amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which may offset the potential advantage of using Mg parts in automobiles. It is critical to quantify the energy usage and GHG emissions through entire life cycle when the Mg are applied to automobiles. It is also essential to evaluate cost implications of the Mg parts application in automobiles and ensure it to be cost competitive. The objectives of this study are (1) Build a life cycle inventory (LCI) of Mg produced by Pidgeon process; (2) Establish an LCA model that can evaluate GHG emissions and energy usage for the Mg automotive application; (3) Estimate the cost implications of the Mg parts application in automobiles. An Mg LCI was built based on interviews and surveys and the GREET model was adapt for this study. The results indicated that, for each kilogram of Mg produced by Pidgeon process, GHG emissions and energy usage would be 27 kg CO(2)eq and 280 MJ, which are five times higher than steel production. Replacing steel with 82 kg Mg on a base automobile would lower curb weight by 5.7%, but only reduce life cycle GHG emissions and energy usage by 0.8% and 1.3%. Scenario analyses indicated that potential reduction of life cycle GHG emissions and energy usage could reach to 15%, if secondary weight saving and a smaller engine were included. Cost analyses also show 18% reduction when the additional weight saving and a smaller displacement engine were included, under a 100,000 km driving distance and gasoline price at $1.0/l.

AB  - To assess their impacts on net global warming, total greenhouse gas emissions (mainly CO2, N2O and CH4) from agricultural production in arable land cropping systems in the Tokachi region of Hokkaido, Japan, were estimated using life cycle inventory (LCI) analysis. The LCI data included CO2 emissions from on-farm and off-farm fossil fuel consumption, soil CO2 emissions induced by the decomposition of soil organic matter, direct and indirect N2O emissions from arable lands and CH4 uptake by soils, which were then aggregated in CO2-equivalents. Under plow-based conventional tillage (CT) cropping systems for winter wheat, sugar beet, adzuki bean, potato and cabbage, on-farm CO2 emissions from fuel-consuming operations such as tractor-based field operations, truck transportation and mechanical grain drying ranged from 0.424 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) for adzuki bean to 0.826 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) for winter wheat. Off-farm CO2 emissions resulting from the use of agricultural materials such as chemical fertilizers, biocides (pesticides and herbicides) and agricultural machines were estimated by input-output tables to range from 0.800 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) for winter wheat to 1.724 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) for sugar beet. Direct N2O emissions previously measured in an Andosol field of this region showed a positive correlation with N fertilizer application rates. These emissions, expressed in CO2-equivalents, ranged from 0.041 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) for potato to 0.382 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) for cabbage. Indirect N2O emissions resulting from N leaching and surface runoff were estimated to range from 0.069 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) for adzuki bean to 0.381 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) for cabbage. The rates of CH4 removal from the atmosphere by soil uptake were equivalent to only 0.020-0.042 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1). From the difference in the total soil C pools (0-20 cm depth) between 1981 and 2001, annual CO2 emissions from the CT and reduced tillage (RT) soils were estimated to be 4.91 and 3.81 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. In total, CO2-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions under CT cropping systems in the Tokachi region of Hokkaido amounted to 6.97, 7.62, 6.44, 6.64 and 7.49 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) for winter wheat, sugar beet, adzuki bean, potato and cabbage production, respectively. Overall, soil-derived CO2 emissions accounted for a large proportion (64-76%) of the total greenhouse gas emissions. This illustrates that soil management practices that enhance C sequestration in soil may be an effective means to mitigate large greenhouse gas emissions from arable land cropping systems such as those in the Tokachi region of northern Japan. Under RT cropping systems, plowing after harvesting was omitted, and total greenhouse gas emissions from winter wheat, sugar beet and adzuki bean could be reduced by 18%, 4% and 18%, respectively, mainly as a result of a lower soil organic matter decomposition rate in the RT soil and a saving on the fuels used for plowing.

AB  - Greenhouse gas emissions inventories and carbon footprints assessed at the local level are critical for any country, mainly for those countries which are part of the Paris Agreement such as Mexico, where federal and local governments join forces to design climate-change mitigation policies. However, determining carbon footprints is time and resource-intensive and not always possible for local governments. To meet this need, we propose an alternative method using lifecycle input-output analysis and location quotients to quantify direct and total emissions of the Mexican state of Puebla caused by its use of electricity during 2013. We quantify the emissions from the production and consumption-based perspective, finding that Puebla's economy emitted a total of 15 million metric tons of CO(2)e caused by industrial sectors' electricity use, which represented 3 % of the total national emissions caused by Mexico's industrial electricity use. The most significant contributors to Puebla's total greenhouse gas emissions were the "food and beverage preparation services" and the "business support services" sectors accounting for 38 % and 9 % of Puebla's total emissions and 50 % and 23 % of direct emissions, respectively. We conclude that, in addition to the decarbonization of the energy matrix, potential climate change mitigation policies should reduce the intensity factors of the sectors with the highest emissions identified with the proposed method.

AB  - Carbon sink is an effective measure to balance the contradiction between economic development and mitigating climate change in China. This paper reveals that environmental performance of forest carbon sinks reflects in economic value by reducing the emissions abatement cost. The carbon trading system is used to demonstrate the environmental and economic value of forests. The forest carbon sequestrations are estimated and predicted in different regions of China. Furthermore, a market model has been established to assess how the emission reduction costs can be reduced among all regions by the year 2030 to achieve the goal of carbon emissions intensity in China. The results show that carbon sequestration trades can reduce the emissions reduction costs and it can represent the value of forest carbon sinks. In particular, when economic growth is maintained in moderate and low level in China, the national carbon trading market with carbon sequestration will decrease the carbon emissions reduction costs more effectively. Besides, carbon sink can bring economic benefits to under-developed regions where there are rich forest resources. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Electric vehicles (EVs) have emerged as a promising solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in urban areas. The construction of EV charging stations (EVCSs) is critical to the development of the EV industry. This article proposes a novel integrated fuzzy inference system (FIS)-based planning framework for determining the optimal locations and capacities of EVCSs with photovoltaic (PV) systems and energy storage units. Several off-site factors that will affect the planning results of EVCSs are analyzed and incorporated into a multiobjective optimization problem, aiming at minimizing the cost of electricity (COE) and emission pollutants simultaneously. The proposed FIS-based planning approach introduces novel fuzzy criteria that account for the nonlinear and difficult-to-model joint effect of social and environmental factors. By incorporating these off-site factors, a more realistic framework for EVCS planning is presented. Numerical studies are conducted on a coupled 33-bus distribution system and 25-bus transportation system to illustrate the proposed planning method. According to the simulation results, employing the proposed FIS-based planning framework not only reduces the search space and simplifies the optimization problem but also makes the results more realistic according to practical system conditions.

AB  - In recent decades, a large number of authors investigated whether income inequality level and climate change were compatible. However, the relationship between inequality level impact and consumption-based greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions was scarcely analysed. Thus, the objective of the present paper was to analyse the relationship between income inequality level and consumption-based GHG emissions from 1990 to 2014 under different stages of economic development. The results revealed a large gap between consumption-based GHG emissions at different economic development stages. Economic growth contributed to the growth of consumption-based GHG emissions in all income groups, and the largest effect was observed in middle-low- and low-income countries. Higher income inequality level was associated with lower negatively influenced consumption-based emissions in high- and middle-high-income countries, confirming the marginal propensity to emit and 'Veblen effect' theories. Meanwhile, regarding the middle-low- and low-income groups, the relationships between inequality level and GHG emissions were insignificant. Urbanisation level contributed to the growth of consumption-based GHG emissions in middle- and low-income countries. Education level contributed to the reduction of consumption-based GHG emissions in high-, middle-high-, and middle-low-income countries, and growth of emissions in low-income countries. Therefore, our analysis revealed that income inequality and climate change are still incompatible in all income groups, and we suggested how to achieve the reduction of income inequality and climate change simultaneously.

AB  - The assessment of the value of ecosystem services is a valuable tool for biodiversity conservation that can facilitate better environmental policy decision-making and land management, and can help land managers develop interventions to compensate for biodiversity loss at the patch level. Previous studies have suggested that it is appropriate to assess the value of biodiversity for conservation planning by considering both the condition of the landscape and the spatial configuration of adjacent land uses that can be reflected as a proximity effect. This research examines the influence of spatial proximity on biodiversity conservation from the ecosystem service perspective based on the assumption that the variation in the proximity effect caused by land cover change has positive or negative impacts on ecological services. Three factors related to the spatial characteristics of the landscape were considered in this approach: the relative artificiality of the land cover types, the distance decay effect of patches and the impact of one land cover type on others. The proximity effect change (PEC) parameter reflected the relationship between the spatial proximity effect and biodiversity conservation. The results of a quantitative and spatial comparative analysis of the proposed method and the conventional method in Yingkou for the periods of 2000-2005 and 2005-2010 showed that the former can account for the temporal and spatial changes in ecosystem services for biodiversity conservation that were caused by patch-level changes as well as the interaction between the altered and adjacent patches from a spatial perspective. The metric can also identify the most critical areas for biodiversity protection and inform the efficient allocation of limited land resources for nature conservation to maximize the benefit to biodiversity by guiding the process of land-use change, particularly urbanization and agriculture. Future studies should focus on the other important factors that are applicable to the assessment of the value of biodiversity conservation in socio-ecological systems, where society and nature are mutually capable of fulfilling their roles.

AB  - Although the importance of corporate social responsibility has received more attention over the years, the goal of social sustainability has still not been achieved. The main reason is that companies seeking to implement social sustainability, have failed to incorporate the concept of corporate social responsibility into their corporate internal control objectives. Furthermore, studying the interactive relationship between corporate social responsibility and internal control and ensuring the consistency of corporate strategy and internal control objectives are done to help promote the sustainable development of enterprises. In order to promote social sustainability and improve management decision-making gaps, therefore, the purpose of this paper is to develop a new hybrid multi-attribute decision model to assess the impact of corporate social responsibility for the implementation of internal control that includes corporate social responsibility. The empirical results show that a social responsibility-oriented internal control system may be a better strategy than maintaining the original internal control objectives. In addition, by adjusting the internal control system to jointly promote the sustainable development goals of the company and ensure the consistency of corporate strategy and internal control objectives, the company can be truly guided to implement the social responsibility management objectives. Finally, the social sustainable development goals can be truly realized, and the interests of all stakeholders in the enterprise can be truly satisfied.

AB  - Converting existing diesel engines to the spark ignition (SI) operation can increase the utilization of natural gas (NG) in heavy-duty applications, which can reduce oil imports in the US and curtail greenhouse-gas emissions. The NG operation at lean-burn conditions was evaluated inside a retrofitted heavy-duty direct-injection compression-ignition (CI) engine, where the diesel injector was replaced with a high-energy spark plug and NG was mixed with air in the intake manifold. Steady-state engine experiments that changed combustion phasing were performed at 13.3 compression ratio, lean equivalence ratio, medium load, and low-speed conditions, fueled with pure methane as NG surrogate. Results suggested that NG combustion inside such retrofitted engines is different from that in conventional SI engines due to the geometric characteristics of the diesel combustion chamber. In detail, the different conditions inside the bowl and the squish partitioned the combustion process into two distinct events in terms of timing and location. Moreover, the squish region helped stabilize the extreme lean operation by creating a highly turbulent flow into the bowl during the compression stroke. However, combustion efficiency and unburned hydrocarbon emissions were significantly affected by the fuel fraction that burned inside the squish region under less than optimal conditions during the expansion stroke. As a result, despite the combustion phasing being the primary control of engine's indicated thermal efficiency, the combustion strategy for CI engines converted to NG SI should optimize the slower burning inside the squish region.

AB  - Bioenergy crops provide enormous renewable biomass resources convertible for biofuel production, but lignocellulose recalcitrance fundamentally determines its enzymatic saccharification at high cost and low efficiency. In this study, total 30 diverse Miscanthus lignocellulose substrates were incubated with T. reesei strain to secret lignocellulose-degradation enzymes, and their major wall polymers features (cellulose crystallinity, hemicellulose arabinose and lignin H-monomer) were meanwhile examined with distinct impacts on the enzyme activities. Using characteristic Miscanthus (Msi62) de-lignin residue as inducing substrate with the reesei strain, this study detected that the Msi62-induced enzymes were of consistently higher enhancements on enzymatic saccharification of various lignocellulose residues examined in 17 grassy and woody bioenergy crops, particularly for the hemicellulose hydrolyses, compared to other two reesei-secreted cellulases and three commercial enzymes. Notably, based on SDSgel protein separation profiling and LC-MS/MS analysis, the Msi62-induced enzymes consist of distinct cellulases (CBHI, BG, EGII) compositions and high-activity xylanases. Therefore, this study has demonstrated an applicable approach to achieve the optimal cellulases and xylanases cocktails that enable for low-costly and high-efficient enzymatic saccharification of diverse lignocellulose sources, providing a potential strategy for large-scale biofuel production in all major bioenergy crops.

AB  - With increasing environmental pollution, China has instituted corresponding environmental regulations to address environmental challenges. Estimating the costs of such environmental regulations can help governments to formulate rational environmental policies. This review estimates the costs of environmental regulations based on a novel perspective of energy consumption. Using panel data for Chinese provincial regions in 2006-2015, we developed a non-parametric directional distance function and estimated different optimal energy inputs based on data envelopment analysis under two scenarios, namely, those with and without emission reduction constraints. The gap between the two groups of optimal energy inputs facilitated the estimation of the energy costs associated with reducing SO2 (sulfur dioxide) emissions in China's industrial sectors. The results suggest that approximately 13.40 tons of standard coal were required to reduce SO2 emissions by 1 ton, highlighting the discrepancy between energy savings and emission reduction. The energy costs of SO2 emission reduction were the highest in West China (18.63), followed by those in Central and Northeast China; meanwhile, those in East China were the lowest (9.91). The large differences between the energy costs of emission reduction in different regions indicated that economically underdeveloped areas have scope for improvement with respect to energy structures and innovation in the green technology field.

AB  - This paper analyses the data on Chinese A-share listed companies from 1996 to 2019, using fixed-effect regression and the double-difference method to systematically examine the impact of commercial credit on enterprise technological innovation. The study found that the acquisition and provision of commercial credit has promoted the number of enterprise technological innovations and significantly improved their quality. In particular, the innovation of highly constrained companies is promoted by financing. Our findings help to solve the obstacles enterprises face in breaking through financing constraints and improving the efficiency and quality of their innovative efforts. The financing system has a significant influence on promoting the sustainable development of innovative enterprises.

AB  - Rapid urbanization has altered the structure and function of urban ecosystems with respect to the demand for planning ecological restoration to inhibit ecological degradation. However, there is still a challenge to quickly and effectively identify the restored priority areas to maximize ecological service (ES) supply and enhance human well-being. Taking the Shenzhen metropolitan region as a case study area, this study identified the restored priority sites based on the ES bundles evolution and urbanization effects. The ES bundles were identified by analyzing the spatial dynamics under the hybrid urban landscape, then the impact of urbanization on the ES bundles was explored using linear regression analysis characterized by different levels of urbanization in different stages. Furthermore, the spatial statistics were used to identify the priority sites. The results showed that 68.78% of the grids had changed their ES bundles in terms of their quantities, types, and sites in Shenzhen during 1978-2018. The urbanization driver spatially shifts from provision of service to regulation and cultural ecosystem services and significantly negatively influences the composition and structure of the ES bundles in different urbanization stages. 1196 of the 1 square kilometer grids, which accounted for 54.17%, were identified to prioritize for ecological restoration in Shenzhen. However, only 4.08% of them need to set as the key ecological restoration site. This study explored an effectively spatial way to implement ecological restoration planning in a rapidly urbanized area.

AB  - The success of the Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) depends on the availability and accessibility of robust data, as well as the reconfiguration of governance systems that can catalyse urban transformation. Given the uneven success of the Millennium Development Goals, and the unprecedented inclusion of the urban in the SDG process, the feasibility of SDG 11 was assessed in advance of its ratification through a series of urban experiments. This paper focusses on Cape Town's participation in piloting SDG 11, in order to explore the role of urban experimentation in highlighting the partnership arrangements necessary to allow cities to meet the data and governance challenges presented by the SDG 11. Specifically, we focus on the relationship between data and governance that lie at the heart of the SDG 11. The urban experiment demonstrates the highly complex and multi-level governance dynamics that shape the way urban experiments are initiated, executed and concluded. The implications of these dependencies illustrate that more attention needs to be paid at the global level to what data are important and how and where the data are generated if SDG 11 is to be met. Overall, this paper makes the case that the success of SDG 11 rests on effecting local level change and enabling real opportunities in cities.

AB  - Long-term spatial and temporal variations of stream flow and suspended sediment discharge of rivers are important for effective planning of available water resources and soil conservation measures. In the present study, the gradual and abrupt change in stream flow and suspended sediment discharge at 21 stream gauging stations which are located on the Godavari River were analysed for the period of 1969 to 2015 (46 years). The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test and the Pettitt test are used to detect gradual and abrupt changes, respectively. The results of MK test indicates that 76% stations show decreasing trend in stream flow, whereas 90% stations show decreasing trend in suspended sediment discharge. The abrupt change is reported in the early and middle period of 1990 to 2000. The significant decreasing trend in stream flow and sediment discharge is due to the construction of extensive dams, land use change and rainfall pattern.

AB  - In the current scenario, worldwide renewable energy systems receive renewed interest because of the global reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. This paper proposes a long-term wind speed prediction model based on various artificial neural network approaches such as Improved Back-Propagation Network (IBPN), Multilayer Perceptron Network (MLPN), Recursive Radial Basis Function Network (RRBFN), and Elman Network with five inputs such as wind direction, temperature, relative humidity, precipitation of water content and wind speed. The proposed ANN-based wind speed forecasting models help plan, integrate, and control power systems and wind farms. The simulation result confirms that the proposed Recursive Radial Basis Function Network (RRBFN) model improves the wind speed prediction accuracy and minimizes the error to a minimum compared to other proposed IBPN, MLPN, and Elman Network-based wind speed prediction models.

AB  - Firms need to develop dynamic capabilities to anticipate, adapt and respond to a changing competitive environment. Quality management, absorptive capacity and sustainability can act as dynamic capabilities, helping firms to adapt better and more quickly to new stakeholder demands. Some dynamic capabilities can help develop others. The aim of this paper is to analyse the role of quality management and absorptive capacity as enablers and drivers of environmental, economic and social sustainability development, and to study the mediating role of absorptive capacity in the relationship between quality management and the three dimensions of sustainability. Through structural equation modelling and using data from Spanish hotels, this study adds value to the dynamic capabilities theory by empirically demonstrating that quality management and absorptive capacity, used together, positively influence (directly or indirectly) the environmental, economic and social sustainability of hotels in order to reduce their environmental impact, and improve the social well-being of stakeholders and the economic development of the region.

AB  - Loss and damage from climate change have risen to a prominent position on the international agenda. At COP27 in 2022, the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) ratified a decision to establish a loss and damage fund to compensate low- and middle-income countries that are suffering negative impacts from climate change. The fund is meant to address the Global Adaptation Gap, which describes the rising cost of adaptation needed to cope with climate change impacts due to delayed action to curb greenhouse gas emissions and remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. This essay highlights issues around loss and damage from climate change from a variety of natural and social science perspectives. From three months of discussions, an interdisciplinary perspective and research agenda on this topic have crystallised, which is outlined here. Given that the implementation of the loss and damage fund still needs negotiation and commitment from signatories to the UNFCCC, it is timely now to address some important knowledge gaps on how loss and damage can be measured, quantified, valued, understood, communicated, and adapted to. Hence, it is necessary to understand the complex interactions between people, politics, nature, and climate in this interdisciplinary context.

AB  - The increase in urbanization and climate change brings new challenges to the cities' sustainability and resilience, mainly related to flood and drought events. Among these challenges, it can be highlighted the physical and health damage to the population, interruption of water, energy and food supply services, damage to basic infrastructure, economic losses and contamination of urban rivers. To contribute to the increase of resilience in urban centers, LID practices have been used as a new approach of mitigation and adaptation within urban drainage systems, aiming at runoff retention, peak flow attenuation, pollutant removal and ecosystem services restoration (e.g., resources recycling, carbon sequestration, thermal comfort and landscape integration). These different mitigation purposes and complementary benefits provided by LID practices can be related to the different Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) presented by the United Nations (UN), to achieve countries' systemic sustainability. The identification of local techniques that contribute to the different SDG helps to achieve their territorialization and application as public policy. Therefore, this paper presents a literature review, categorizing the studies into different generations based on their main application purpose and presents a linkage of the LID benefits to different SDG. Some challenges were identified requiring further investigation, such as the need to identify and quantify the energy demands for LID practices maintenance and their incorporation in the system final energy balance, identification of processes that contribute to carbon sequestration and emission, and risks of emerging pollutants for human health from water reuse and nutrient cycling for sustainable agriculture.

AB  - Selecting a sustainable municipal solid waste management (MSWM) scenario can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and deal with the energy crisis, effectively. However, traditional decision approaches only rank alternative scenarios but fail to manage them. Implementing effective management for alternative MSWM scenarios can save decision costs and improve efficiency. Thus, this paper aims to construct a novel multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) methodology to manage and rank sustainable scenarios. To evaluate sustainable MSWM scenarios, a comprehensive evaluation index system is constructed from five dimensions including economy, environment, society, technology, and energy. The hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set is employed to articulate evaluation information. Given the importance of experts and the incomplete criteria weight information, an inclusion measure-based approach is proposed to obtain expert weights, and the grey relational analysis linear programming model with incomplete criteria weight information is constructed to determine criteria weights. An inclusion measure-based hesitant fuzzy linguistic multigranulation three-way decisions over two universes approach is developed to manage and rank alternative MSWM scenarios. The feasibility of the proposed methodology is illustrated by a numerical case. Triple sensitivity analysis is performed from the perspectives of decision-makers' risk appetite, expert weight fluctuations, and criteria weight fluctuations. A comparative analysis is implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methodology. This study provides a novel insight to solve MSWM scenario selection and can extensively be applied to handle other MCGDM problems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding the dynamics and relationships among ecosystem services (ESs) and their underlying socioecological driving mechanisms has great importance for policy-makers to achieve sustainable development. In this study, using the City Belt along the Yellow River in Ningxia, China as the study area, we quantified and mapped five ESs for the period 1989-2017, analyzed the spatial relationships among ESs through hotspots analysis, correlation analysis and cluster delineation, and explored the dynamic impacts of socio-ecological factors on ESs through random forest analysis. The results showed that spatial distributions and relationships among ESs had significant change over the past three decades, driven by the varied impacts of socio-ecological factors. Cropland in the central plain could supply higher values of food production, carbon sequestration and nutrient retention, which were mainly impacted by land use pattern and vegetation coverage and existed significant synergies among them at regional scale. Specially, the hotspots of food production and carbon sequestration both decreased in the northern part over time, while the former one was caused by the increasing impacts of socioeconomic indicators and the latter one by climate factors. Northwestern and southern mountains could provide higher values of sand fixation, which was mainly impacted by the increasing impact of topography and decreasing impact of climate factors. Thus hotspots of sand fixation increased in the mountainous areas and decreased in other regions. Socio-economic factors had an increasing impact on recreational opportunity, resulting the transformation of its hotspots from mountains to the central Yinchuan city and transition region between mountains and central plain. Dynamic impacts of socio-ecological factors could alter the spatial relationships among ESs and impact their co-occurrence across space. Specific management strategies have been proposed for different sub-regions to improve ESs under the land-use system reform, ecological civilization and rural revitalization in China.

AB  - Health equity is significant for social sustainability and the Chinese government is trying to achieve the goals of "universal access to basic health care services". As the comprehensive carrier of health care services, hospitals are almost the most important health care resources and their regional maldistribution needs to give a special concern for health justice and social sustainability. This study aims to explore regional maldistribution of various hospitals through constructing, decomposing and calculating per capita hospitals Gini Coefficient based on the unique structural system of China's hospitals from 2003-2014. Results show that: (1) the level of regional maldistribution of hospitals in China is not too serious in terms of quantity and there is a slight decline in recent years; (2) regional maldistribution of hospitals is mainly from General Hospitals and in inland areas; and (3) the slight decrease of regional maldistribution is mainly caused by Concentration Effect and increased per capita hospitals. Based on empirical results and the reality of China, some targeted policy suggestions are proposed to reduce regional maldistribution of hospitals and promote health equity for social sustainable development.

AB  - Background: The world has experienced devastating extreme weather events, alongside slow-onset processes including increasing temperature means, that scientists agree are manifestations of human-induced climate change. Even with radical action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, effects of climate change will become increasingly severe. Objectives: The aim of this review was to classify impacts of climate change for people who use alcohol and other drugs (AoD), as reflected in peer reviewed literature. Method: A scoping review was conducted to achieve this. Included studies involved a human population, a climate change related exposure, and an AoD outcome. Studies were published in English between 1998 and November 2023. Exposure events of interest included extreme heat, fires, storms, floods, droughts, and longerterm environmental changes. 8,204 studies were screened, with 82 included for data extraction and narrative analysis. Results: Most papers describe increased AoD use, with smaller numbers showing decreased or unchanged substance use. Some studies identify unplanned withdrawal, changed drug markets, disrupted service access, specific physiological vulnerabilities of AoD users to extreme heat, and compounding effects on mental health. We note the relative absence of peer reviewed studies investigating impacts of climate change on AoD use in low-and middle-income countries. Further, few studies consider impacts that occur because of long-term or gradual climatic shifts such as environmental changes that are detrimental to livelihoods. Conclusion: It is crucial to document effects of a changing climate on people who use AoD so that policy and services can meet future needs. We call for research to remedy gaps identified in this review.

AB  - Concerns over rapid widespread changes in social-ecological systems and their consequences for biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, food security, and human livelihoods are driving demands for globally comprehensive knowledge to support decision-making and policy development. Claims of regional or global knowledge about the patterns, causes, and significance of changes in social-ecological systems, or 'generalized knowledge claims' (GKCs), are generally produced by synthesis of evidence compiled from local and regional case study observations. GKCs now constitute a wide and varied body of research, yet they are also increasingly contested based on disagreements about their geographic, temporal, and/or thematic validity. There are no accepted guidelines for detecting biases or logical gaps between GKC's and the evidence used to produce them. Here, we propose a typology of GKCs based on their evidence base and the process by which they are produced. The typology is structured by three dimensions: i) the prior state of knowledge about the phenomenon of interest; ii) the logic of generalization underlying the claim; and iii) the methodology for generalization. From this typology, we propose a standardized approach to assess the quality and commensurability of these dimensions for any given GKC, and their ability to produce robust and transparent knowledge based on constituent evidence, We then apply this approach to evaluate two contested GKCs - addressing global biodiversity and large-scale land acquisitions - and in doing so demonstrate a coherent approach to assessing and evaluating the scope and validity of GKCs. With this approach, GKCs can be produced and applied with greater transparency and accuracy, advancing the goal of actionable science on social-ecological systems.

AB  - Biochar promotes microbial metabolic activities and reduces N2O on aerobic composting. However, the effects of magnetic biochar (MBC) on the microbial succession and N2O emissions during pig manure composting remain unclear. Herein, a 42-day composting experiment was conducted with five treatment regimes: pig manure without biochar (CK), 5 % pig manure-based biochar (5 % PBC), 2 % MBC (2 % MBC), 5 % MBC (5 % MBC) and 7.5 % MBC (7.5 % MBC)), to clarify the variation in functional microorganisms and genes associated with nitrogen and direct interspecies electron transfer via metagenomics. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy showed that MBC possessed more stable aromatic structures than pig manure-based biochar (PBC), indicating its greater potential for nitrous oxide reduction. MBC treatments were more effective in composting organic matter and improving the carbon/nitrogen ratio than PBC. The microbial composition during composting varied significantly, with the dominant phyla shifting from Firmicutes to Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidota. Network and hierarchical clustering analyses showed that the MBC treatment enhanced the interactions of dominant microbes (Proteobacteria and Bacteroidota) and accelerated the composting process. The biochar addition accelerated assimilatory nitrate reduction and slowed dissimilatory nitrate reduction and denitrification. The Mantel test demonstrated that magnetic biochar potentially helped regulate composting nutrients and affected functional nitrogen genes. These findings shed light on the role of MBC in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions during aerobic composting.

AB  - The significance of green values is growing in the furniture sector; customers are demanding more specific environmental information of the products, new regulations are tackling to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Life-cycle assessment is an important tool for better understanding, awareness and communication of environmental issues. It can also help to develop more energy and resource efficient production processes contributing to overall improvement of environmental performance of products. The main objective of this study was to assess greenhouse gas emissions of different furniture. Eight different furniture manufacturing processes were assessed to identify main factors that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Life-cycle assessment software was used to assess cradle to gate impacts of manufacturing processes. Case study results shows that materials have a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions of products (38-90 per cent). Processing and assembling can also have impact on greenhouse gas emissions (8-58 per cent); packaging and transportation have a minor role (1-8 per cent). Our results indicate that the environmental impacts of products can be reduced by influencing the materials selection and energy generation systems. Energy from renewable and biogenic energy resources can reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly in all production stages. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The U.S. Department of Energy funded Co-Optimization of Fuels and Engines initiative aims to simultaneously develop advanced engines along with high-performance fuels to reduce petroleum consumption. The engine exhaust of spark-ignited light-duty vehicles contains pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide (CO), and non-methane organic gases. When operated above their "light-off" temperature, three-way catalysts (TWCs) efficiently control the emissions of these pollutants from the vehicle exhaust. However, below the catalyst light-off temperature, during cold start, the TWCs are not effective. Thus, the stringent environmental regulations necessitate cold-start compliance of advanced engines operating on novel fuels for commercialization. Exhaust composition strongly impacts the effectiveness of TWCs. Hence, ensuring that the high-performance fuels under consideration do not have detrimental effects on current emissions control technology is necessary. To mitigate cold-start emissions, a low light-off temperature of the fuel on the TWC is desirable. As real-world fuels are multicomponent blends, we conducted investigations into the light-off behavior of representative fuel mixtures on a three-mode redox-aged commercial TWC under synthetic engine-exhaust conditions. The high-performance fuels in this study included 10-30% volumetric levels of ethanol, isobutanol, diisobutylene, and an aromatic mixture. Each of these high-performance fuel components was mixed into a gasoline surrogate blendstock for oxygenate blending (BOB). Our results showed that aromatics and alkenes in the surrogate BOB inhibit low-temperature reactivity of alkanes, alcohols, and CO on the TWC and dominate the blend light-off behavior. All the high-performance fuel blends had a very similar light-off behavior to the surrogate gasoline BOB, indicating that blending up to 30% (by vol.) of high-performance blendstocks in a gasoline base fuel can potentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions through improved engine efficiency and petroleum displacement without jeopardizing the ability to meet emissions regulations. While some high-performance blendstocks demonstrated lower light-off temperatures than a surrogate gasoline blend, taking advantage of the higher catalytic reactivity of these blendstocks to reduce cold-start emissions would require reducing the aromatic content in petroleum-based market fuels.

AB  - Intense anthropogenic activity continues to expose the natural environment to heavy metal contamination. Whilst a number of physical and chemical solutions for remediation exist, the use of higher plants and algae for clean-up of contaminated landscapes, termed 'phytoremediation' and 'phycoremediation', respectively, offer an attractive and sustainable alternative. However, these remediation processes will always lead to a high-moisture, heavy metal-contaminated biomass, which must be further processed to partition, or render inert, the metal contaminants. Conversion of this metal-rich biomass into second-generation biofuels offers a useful route to subsidise the economics of remediation activities. Here we briefly review the various methods for bioremediation of heavy metals, and discuss the potential to produce bioenergy from these biomass sources. Coupling the bioremediation activity to bioenergy production gives far-reaching social and economic benefits; however, established processes such as direct combustion and anaerobic digestion risk releasing heavy metals back into the environment. Alternatively, thermochemical conversions such as pyrolysis or hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) offer significant advantages in terms of the segregation of metals into a relatively inert and compact solid phase while producing a biocrude oil for bioenergy production. In addition, preliminary work suggests that the HTL process can also be used to partition essential macronutrients, such as N, P and K, into an aqueous medium, allowing additional nutrient recycling.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of internationally changing market conditions versus national innovation systems (NIS) for environmental innovation in a transforming industry sector, the Nordic pulp and paper industry. Design/methodology/approach - Based on several case studies of technological innovations in the sector, using data triangulation, crucial factors for environmental innovation are analyzed. The cases focus on bioenergy technologies in pulp mills and on new products from fiber. Findings - While NIS still supports the networks through which innovations are created, the formation of innovation markets is increasingly dependent on international developments. Environmental innovation is most likely to occur when momentum is created by simultaneous changes in private and policy- created markets. Environmental policies, increasingly originating at the EU level, have added the final impetus for bioenergy technologies, while for new products the policy effect has been smaller. Practical implications - National innovation policies must be designed to take into account the internationalizing influences on environmental innovation. Originality/value - The paper shows the continued importance of NIS in a low-and-medium technology sector despite internationalizing markets.

AB  - The development of bioenergy in marginal environments has been hampered by the lack of sustainable sources of biomass. The halophyte Salicornia bigelovii, has been found to adapt extremely well in a desert climate. In this study, the S. bigelovii seed and the seedless-plant have been assessed, for the first time, for biofuel and biochar production through thermochemical conversion (pyrolysis) in an auger reactor operated at 550 degrees C. Both feed-stocks showed significant differences in chemical composition, with the seed being closer to the characteristics of seeds from common oilseed crops. The S. bigelovii seed produced high bio-oil yield (79.9% of total liquid) of high pH predominated with fatty acids commonly found in vegetable oils. The S. bigelovii seedless-plant produced a liquid of significantly low bio-oil (10% of total liquid) with an aqueous phase of pH and salinity close that of brackish water. The biochars were of moderate heating value and limited potentials for soil amendment due to the high ash content in the biomass, but are reasonably stable for long term carbon sequestration due to their low O/C and H/C ratios (<0.1 and <1.0, respectively). Comparative assessment in terms of the conversion efficiency and renewability indicated that pyrolysis of the S. bigelovii seed offers a good opportunity for biofuel production in arid/semi-arid saline regions against the alternative option of transesterification conversion.

AB  - Arctic streams are highly sensitive to climate warming due to changes in water temperature and nutrient availability. Mosses are the dominant benthic primary producers in low-order streams in Greenland, and climate induced ecosystem alterations are expected to cause significant changes to their growth and productivity rates. However, the combined effects of climate change to stream mosses are relatively unknown. In this study, we conducted a full factorial experiment with three levels of nutrients and temperatures, and we measured primary productivity by applying the C-14-CO2 tracer method, relative growth rate (RGR), shoot elongation (SE) and lateral growth (length of branches, LB; Shoot density, SD). We aimed to investigate the single and interactive effect of temperature and nutrient enrichment on growth (biomass and elongation), primary productivity and shoot morphology of the Arctic aquatic moss Hygrohypnella ochracea. We found that low temperature determines H. ochracea growth however, the effect of nutrient enrichment became increasingly significant with increasing temperature. We also found important morphological changes in moss lateral growth which is expected to cause fundamental changes in moss community structure. Our results demonstrated that, in the low-order Arctic streams, climate change will cause shifts in benthic primary productivity, growth and morphology, and these changes are expected to cause cascading effects on the stream ecosystem structure, biodiversity and function.

AB  - The drive to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) becomes more urgent as the 2030 deadline draws near, increasing research in various sectors. Nevertheless, studies that systematically map Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) publications with the SDGs need to be more conspicuously lacking. Our study adds a new perspective to the field by creatively bridging this knowledge gap using the Elsevier SDG Mapping Initiative. To find research clusters, trends, and themes linked to SDGs and their connection to environmental sustainability, we thoroughly analyzed 29,897 publications from 2012 to 2022. The analysis showed that SDG 15, SDG 7, SDG 12, SDG 13, and SDG 11 were the top five SDGs, with an environmental focus among the 17 SDGs. These top SDGs had many clusters connected to them, illustrating various sustainability-related problems. The study also looked at connections between SDGs, the nations with the highest rates of productivity, the top contributors, and the journals with the highest citation counts. We discovered three separate SDG clusters using co-occurrence network analysis, each representing a different SDG. We discovered relevant SDGs using Matrice d'impacts croise & PRIME;s multiplication applique & PRIME;e a & PRIME; un classment (MICMAC) analysis and centrality indicators like eigenvector and betweenness. This novel method for publishing analysis combines an AHP focus that aligns with the SDGs with social network analysis and centrality metrics. Our research advances knowledge of how the AHP technique can assess initiatives supporting the SDGs. We offer essential insights into prioritizing sustainable development measures by identifying research clusters, trends, and issues related to environmental sustainability. This study highlights the subject's most important SDGs, productive nations, helpful organizations, and significant journals.

AB  - This paper examines the tension between needing to build more infrastructure and housing and simultaneously reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change. This study uses an Environmentally Extended Input-Output approach to conduct a high-resolution top-down analysis of Canada's national construction GHG emissions. Our findings highlight that Canada's current construction practices cannot accommodate the construction required to restore housing affordability by 2030 without substantial environmental consequences. On a consumption life cycle basis, the construction sector was responsible for approximately 90 Mt CO2e in 2018, equivalent to over 8% of Canada's total GHG emissions, while delivering less than a third of Canada's annual housing needs. Residential construction was responsible for the largest share (42%) of total construction emissions. Overall, 84% of emissions are from material manufacturing and 35% of construction emissions are imported, underscoring the need for a comprehensive regulatory framework addressing both domestic and imported emissions. Under current construction practices (i.e. current material use patterns and emissions intensities), meeting Canada's 2030 housing affordability and climate commitments requires an 83% reduction in GHG emissions per construction product (i.e. per home) compared to the 40% economy-wide reduction promised in Canada's international reduction commitments. Mitigating the GHG gap between emission caps and housing demand calls for changes in the ratio of housing to other infrastructure (e.g. fewer roads, less fossil fuel infrastructure), new construction approaches (e.g. increasing material efficiency) and/or disproportionally allocating climate budget to construction. The implications of our study extend beyond Canada, offering valuable insights for other growing countries with climate goals. The results emphasize the urgency in considering and establishing sectoral GHG budgets for construction and for transformative changes in the construction sector to meet national GHG emission reduction commitments.

AB  - This research examines the spatio-temporal trends in Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Global Inventory Modelling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series to ascribe land use change and precipitation to observed changes in land cover from 1982 to 2007 in the Mexican Yucatan Peninsula, using seasonal trend analysis (STA). In addition to discrete land cover transitions across the study region, patterns of agricultural intensification, urban expansion and afforestation in protected areas have enacted changes to the seasonal patterns of apparent greenness observed through STA greenness parameters. The results indicate that the seasonal variation in NDVI can be used to distinguish among different land cover transitions, and the primary differences among these transitions were in changes in overall greenness, peak annual greenness and the timing of the growing season. Associations between greenness trends and precipitation were weak, indicating a human-dominated system for the 26 years examined. Changes in the states of Campeche, Quintana Roo and Yucatan appear to be associated with pasture cultivation, urban expansion-extensive cultivation and urban expansion-intensive cultivation, respectively.

AB  - Health tourism is recognised as a growing industry. Therefore, sustainable development in health tourism is crucial not only for the well-being of patients but also for destinations and communities. In this sense, sustainable development in health tourism aims to develop solutions related to the environmental, social, and economic challenges faced by the country and the tourism sector. After the COVID-19 pandemic, health tourism has become popular, and despite the increase in research related to the theme, the existing literature is still relatively fragmented and lacks a comprehensive view. This study addresses this gap by investigating sustainable development in health tourism through a systematic literature review. Ninety-three articles were collected from the Web of Science database. After subjecting them to bibliometric analysis, it is possible to examine the topic's current state of the art. This research permits the systematisation of the existing literature into five areas: (1) stakeholders of sustainable tourism, (2) impact of COVID-19, (3) health tourism, (4) challenges and opportunities, and (5) sustainability values. This research provides significant contributions to the field of sustainable development in health tourism. Firstly, it sheds light on aspects that previous literature has examined, offering valuable insights into the drivers of sustainable development in health tourism, thus enriching our comprehension of the subject. Additionally, the article delineates a prospective research agenda, suggesting various directions that can lay the foundation for upcoming inquiries and the development of pertinent theories for assessing the impact of sustainable development in health tourism.

AB  - Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare incurable tumor. Interest in MPM has increased in recent years due to a steadily increasing incidence subsequent to the intensive use of asbestosis, the main causal agent, but also due to better awareness in the political and scientific communities faced with a serious public health issue. Our knowledge of MPM has improved regularly in terms of pathologic diagnosis and the mechanisms underlying the mesothelial carcinogenesis. MPM is also the subject of many technological innovations as illustrated by the recent identification of new biological markers, access to metabolic imaging, and clinical research on targeted treatments. Proper management implies the participation of the general population since the implementation of administrative procedures for social indemnities. In 2007, a more aggressive therapeutic approach is becoming common practice with the use of radiotherapy and the emergence of the concept of multimodal care centered on wide pleuropneumonectomy. These advances create real hope for improvement, but also many interrogations since no standard treatment protocol has been clearly identified.

AB  - California law requires statewide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to return to 1990 levels by 2020-a goal achieved in 2016, four years early. We conduct the first independent retrospective analysis of California's greenhouse gas emissions to assess how the state has achieved faster-than-expected emissions reductions. We analyze the extent to which economic activity, climate policies, and market forces drove California's greenhouse gas emissions trends overall and in two key categories: electricity and light-duty vehicles. We also compare historical trends with business-as-usual and policy expectations from the 2008 Climate Change Scoping Plan, California's official strategy for achieving the 2020 emissions limit. Our analysis, based on data through 2017, indicates that reduced economic activity during the 2008-2009 recession and its aftermath has been a major contributor to early achievement of the 2020 emissions limit. Policies and market forces, however, have played a larger role in reducing emissions in recent years-particularly in the electricity sector, which has decarbonized more rapidly than expected. Meanwhile, GHG emissions from light-duty vehicles in recent years were rising, not falling, in contrast to expectations. Our analysis demonstrates how decomposition methods can be used to track climate policy implementation and inform future policy development.

AB  - Evaluating the spatial relationship between the supply of and demand for cultural ecosystem services (CESs) in rapidly urbanizing watersheds is critical for landscape planning and the improvement of human well-being. However, few approaches can investigate relationships of multiple CESs in a spatially explicit way and involve different groups of stakeholders. In our study, we developed an integrated approach that combined a survey-driven model (SOlVES) and a text analysis of the social media reviews, using the Guanting Reservoir basin as an example. Three CESs, including aesthetic service, historical and cultural service, and recreational and therapeutic service, were examined. The results showed that 80% of the total area of the basin exhibited a spatial mismatch between CES supply and demand. Among the three CESs, historical and cultural service had the largest mismatched area, which was dominated by a low supply and high demand. For the venue of the 2022 Winter Olympics, Chongli District, all three CESs exhibited spatial mismatches, while the main type of mismatch was low supply and high demand. Urbanization can either promote a match or worsen a mismatch. Therefore, place-based solutions, such as environmental monitoring and promoting tourism, are encouraged to mitigate the mismatch of CES supply and demand in rapidly urbanizing watersheds.

AB  - Calls for investment in green infrastructures, which can provide a range of ecosystem services in support of sustainability and resilience, are increasing amidst the climate crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed for many the important benefits of greenspace to cultural ecosystem services, particularly to individuals' own assessments of their mental and emotional health, or subjective well-being (SWB). This pandemic has also revealed the unevenness of these benefits. In order to better understand the contributions of greenspace to SWB, as well as the distribution of the benefits, during times of shared social-ecological disruption, we investigate perceptions of greenspace and their effect on SWB during the COVID-19 pandemic. We use a mixed methods approach combining data from surveys and interviews conducted with US post-secondary students. Our results indicate that perceiving the outdoors as good for you is related to higher levels of SWB. We also find that both prior experience with nature and current social-environmental circumstances play an important role in shaping this perception. When considered alongside research regarding environmental justice and children's access to nature, these findings suggest a need for both distributional and intergenerational justice in greenspace planning, design, and management, as well as explicit attention to the role of greenspace in coping with future social-ecological disturbance.

AB  - Ambient air pollution from PM2.5 is a major risk to human and environmental health, with significant impacts on mortality and morbidity. Mitigation policies-which may be regional or national in extent-need to consider both primary and secondary particles to be effective, balancing within-region emissions and longer-range transport phenomena. The modelling system WRF-CMAQ was used to simulate the impact of emissions reductions in the West Midlands region of the UK, evaluating the change in total PM2.5 and in its primary and secondary components. Domestic combustion, road transport and agriculture emissions were reduced individually or in combination, at a national or at local level. Combined reduction of road transport and agriculture emissions showed the strongest reduction (29%) in average PM2.5 if applied at national level. At the local level, reductions from domestic combustion were shown to be the most effective policy (13.4% on average). Secondary inorganic fractions of PM2.5 are the most abundant, with 25% NO3- 21% SO42- and 13% NH4+ on average. Scenario analysis shows that the contribution of secondary components to the fractional change of PM2.5 dominates for national policies (up to 0.86 for NO3-) when road transport and agriculture activities are reduced, while at the regional level the elemental and organic carbon fractional changes are dominant (up to 0.64 for organic carbon).

AB  - Unprecedented levels of plastics are entering coastal seas, which are already subject to another insidious pollutant: excess nitrogen. Both pollutants were created to enhance human well-being on land but once in the sea they impair the function of filter-feeding organisms that help maintain coastal water quality. We conceptualized evidence to show that oysters (Ostrea spp), the reefs of which can provide a biological solution for managing water quality, can effectively reduce the threat of algal blooms caused by excess nitrogen pollution, even when exposed to moderate microplastic pollution. Yet the functional collapse of this ecosystem service (filter-feeding by oysters) is at risk if current trends in plastic pollution continue, and pollution thresholds that predict functional collapse have already been exceeded in the world's most polluted rivers. Nevertheless, although the plastic problem is daunting, growing social and political awareness of the need to reduce plastic waste provides hope that a sustainable material society can be attained.

AB  - This paper discusses new developments in leadacid battery chemistry and the importance of the system approach for implementation of battery energy storage for renewable energy and grid applications. The described solution includes thermal management of an UltraBattery bank, an inverter/ charger, and smart grid management, which can monitor the state of charge (SoC) and the state of health (SoH) of the battery during system operation. With such features, it can allow the battery to operate within an optimum SoC window and thus can further maximize the longevity of the UltraBattery. Importantly, the smart battery management can trend the SoH of the battery and allow cell replacement at a convenient time without affecting the system operation. Furthermore, the advanced system package allows remote monitoring and control of operation, thus reducing the running cost of the system. It is clear that the widespread use of renewable-energy systems, in turn, would lead to a reduction in global consumption of the limited supplies of the fossil fuels and in the associated production of greenhouse-gas emissions.

AB  - LCA has evolved fromits origins in energy analysis in the 1960s and 70s into a wide ranging tool used to determine impacts of products or systems over several environmental and resource issues. The approach has become more prevalent in research, industry and policy. Its use continues to expand as it seeks to encompass impacts as diverse as resource accounting and social well being. Carbon policy for bioenergy has driven many of these changes. Enabling assessment of complex issues over a life cycle basis is beneficial, but the process is sometimes difficult. LCA's use in framing is increasingly complex and more uncertain, and in some cases, irreconcilable. The charged environment surrounding biofuels and bioenergy exacerbates all of these. Reaching its full potential to help guide difficult policy discussions and emerging research involves successfully managing LCA's transition from attributional to consequential and from retrospective to prospective. This paper examines LCA's on-going evolution and its use within bioenergy deployment. The management of methodological growth in the context of the unique challenges associated with bioenergy and biofuels is explored. Changes seen in bioenergy LCA will bleed into other LCA arenas, especially where it is important that a sustainable solution is chosen. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Social Enterprises (SEs) are part of new business models that seek to achieve two concurrent missions: economic and social/environmental. These businesses aim to minimize socio-environmental problems by offering products and services focused on socioenvironmental sustainability. The objective of this research was to analyze the impact measurement process by identifying the main impact indicators established by the investigated SE. The applied methodology is qualitative and descriptive, using a single case study. The chosen case was a SE operating in the organic and agroecological food sector in Fortaleza-CE. The results indicate that impact measurement brings advantages throughout the entire supply chain: for the farmers, the main impact is the guarantee of production and, thus, recurring income. For the SE, the indicators allow for better management organization and provide proof of the positive impact generated. For retail customers, the collected information is used to publicize ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) practices. Regarding the indicators used to measure the SE activities' impact, it was found that they are aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) established by the UN (United Nations) for 2030, which are: Poverty Eradication (SDG 1), Zero Hunger (SDG 2), Gender Equality (SDG 5), Reduction of Inequalities (SDG 10), Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12), and Climate Action (SDG 13).

AB  - Environmental problems, combined with a finite supply of fossil fuels, have made the use of renewable energy sources necessary. Biomass is a renewable source of energy that has played a very important role in energy production in recent years. Because there are a number of technologies that can be used to convert biomass into energy, it is important to select the best option. The fact that multiple options are available that need to be evaluated based on a set of decision-making criteria makes this a multicriteria decision-making problem. This paper takes the first step in proposing an evaluation framework and identifying the importance of the relevant decision-making criteria in biofuel production technology selection. To determine the importance of the selection criteria, experts were asked to respond to an online questionnaire based on the best-worst method. The results indicate that air pollution, land use change, and human expertise are the three most important criteria for selecting the best biofuel production technology in our case country, Iran.

AB  - As the Paris Agreement target year of 2030 draws nearer, it is becoming increasingly evident that neither Australia nor many other nations are progressing at a rate sufficient to meet greenhouse gas emissions targets. One area in which to improve performance is in the use of low embodied energy construction materials. Rammed earth (RE) is often considered to be one such material. However, many modern RE variations incorporate cement: a significant contributor to global CO2 emissions. RE materials with low greenhouse gas emissions have been developed as replacements for conventional construction materials. In this series, we examine the strength development, durability and sustainability, via life cycle assessment, of these new materials. This paper explores the cradle-to-gate greenhouse gas emissions of RE materials incorporating recycled waste (crushed brick and concrete), industrial by-products (ground granulated blast furnace slag, fly ash and silica fume) and either NaOH or hydrated lime. These are then compared to construction techniques conventionally used in Australia (cavity brick and brick veneer). Attributional life cycle assessments were carried out for hypothetical building envelopes suitable for climate zones 1-7, assuming construction in metropolitan Perth and 600 km inland (Kalgoorlie, WA). Results showed that greenhouse gas emissions per vertical square metre of wall could be reduced by 73% or 57% respectively when compared to traditional cavity brickwork or brick veneer. This is in contrast to RE incorporating cement, which produced a saving of just 15% compared to brick veneer. If this construction technique were adopted across Australia for new, detached dwellings constructed during 2021-2030, this could represent a greenhouse gas reduction of 11.3 million tonnes CO2eq, or 1.2-1.3% of the cumulative emissions reductions required in 2021-2030 to meet Australia's Paris Agreement targets.

AB  - Recently, large parts of India and the global South have experienced a rapid transformation from mud to cement houses, which has been promoted by governments and cement companies for its positive impacts on household socioeconomic status and gender inequalities. But we know little else about how different communities are participating in house transformation. In this paper, I study the embodied and affective dimensions of house transformation in Himachal Pradesh, India. I argue that house transformation is also the transformation of traditional gender and caste identities into new middle-class identities which benefits some social groups, like upper-caste women and Dalit men, but not others like Dalit women along intersectional lines. My work extends literature in infrastructure studies and urban political ecology by highlighting how the materiality of infrastructures interacts with everyday dimensions of difference to reproduce the marginalisation of historically oppressed groups along intersectional lines of class, caste, and gender.

AB  - Nitrogen-based fertilizer, primarily urea, production generates 2.1% of global CO2 emissions through the energy-intensive Bosch-Meiser process. Electrochemical urea synthesis offers a sustainable alternative by significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. While numerous review articles have focused on the electrocatalytic synthesis of urea using nanostructures or heterostructures composed of transition metal alloys that leverage the synergistic effects of distinct metal catalytic sites, no comprehensive reviews have explored the application of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) in this context. Following the publication of the Nature Synthesis paper in 2024, which reported a nearly fivefold increase in yield rate compared to existing catalysts, we revisited the electrosynthesis of urea using MOF materials. Over the past two years, a few high-impact papers have been published on MOF-based materials, which have emerged as promising catalysts for electrochemical urea synthesis, demonstrating notable efficiency and stability. This review aims to highlight these MOF-based materials, their catalytic performance, and underlying mechanism in electrocatalytic urea synthesis.

AB  - Today physical, biological and social worlds develop increasingly quicker and in a more complex way that includes the phenomena of metamorphoses. Traditionally, they were considered as determined mainly by external factors, i.e. the forces of nature. Contemporary metamorphoses seem to become of a complex man-made nature. Compared to traditional metamorphoses with 'rigid' and predictable results, contemporary metamorphoses of societies can produce both negative and positive consequences, which proves the non-linear dynamic picture of the world. There is also a traumatic tendency - when something is metamorphosed into 'nothing'. Due to digitalization, 'nothing' becomes more complex and 'pure' from cultural and humane characteristics, thus, revealing new expressions of the 'death' of the social: humans are metamorphosed into 'digital beings'. Metamorphization of society can produce common goods as a side effect of the bad. The author argues that the formal-rational, pragmatic transformations of society and nature, like the scientific and technological innovations of mercantile type, deform and dehumanize life-worlds. The global traumatization in the form of 'liquid' catastrophes permanently changes the living and non-living nature, structure of soil, water and air, desocializes human relations, facilitates transformations of something into nothing, people into 'non-people', places into 'non-places', things into 'non-things'. However, people as reflexive actors can turn metamorphoses into 'things-for-man'. To start this process, it is necessary to change the pragmatic monodisciplinary principles of science by the interdisciplinarity ones to ensure a humanistic turn in science and technologies.

AB  - There is substantial interest in restoring tidal wetlands because of their high rates of long-term soil carbon sequestration and other valued ecosystem services. However, these wetlands are sometimes net sources of greenhouse gases (GHG) that may offset their climate cooling potential. GHG fluxes vary widely within and across tidal wetlands, so it is essential to better understand how key environmental drivers, and importantly, land management, affect GHG dynamics. We measured methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes at 26 reference and restored tidal wetland sites and eight nontidal pastures (mostly diked former tidal wetlands) in five estuaries in the Pacific Northwest (PNW), USA. We measured fluxes 7-8 times over one year to assess the effects of environmental drivers, wetland type, and land management on CH4 and N2O fluxes. Linear relationships between CH4 fluxes and environmental drivers were poor, but a machine-learning approach with boosted regression trees provided strong predictability for fluxes based upon wetland surface elevation, water-table level, and salinity. Less important variables were groundwater pH, wetland type, and temperature. Under oligohaline conditions, CH4 fluxes were variable and sometimes very high, but fluxes at salinities above 2 ppt were relatively low on an annual basis. Fluxes of CH4 were higher in restored tidal marshes and wet pastures than in reference tidal marshes, tidal swamps, and dry pastures. The N2O model had lower predictive power than the CH4 model, with wetland type as the most important factor, although N2O fluxes across all wetland types were low (median of zero). Our results indicate that estuarine hydrologic gradients are a key driver of CH4 fluxes and that wetland land use impacts on CH4 fluxes are largely mediated by their varying environmental conditions. In the PNW, estuarine wetlands that have low salinity, lower elevation, and have high water tables are more likely to have increased CH4 emissions that may offset their carbon sequestration benefits until they gain enough elevation through accretion. This study also provides a transferrable modeling approach to predict the consequences of coastal wetland management on GHG fluxes using monitoring data from a limited set of key environmental drivers.

AB  - Two processes are examined for production of methanol. They are assessed against the essential requirements of a future alternative fuel for road transport: that it (i) is producible in amounts comparable to the 19 EJ of motor fuel annually consumed in the U.S., (ii) minimizes emissions of criteria pollutants, (iii) reduces greenhouse gas emissions from production and use, (iv) is cost-competitive with petroleum fuel, and (v) is compatible with the emerging vehicle technologies, especially those powered by fuel cells. The methanol yield, production cost, and potential for reduction of overall fuel-cycle CO2 emissions were evaluated and compared to those of reformulated gasoline. The results show that a process utilizing natural gas and biomass as cofeedstocks can meet the five requirements more effectivly than individual processes utilizing those feedstocks separately. When end-use efficiencies are accounted for, the cost per vehicle mile traveled would be less than that of gasoline used in current vehicles. CO2 emissions from the vehicle fleet would be reduced 66% by methanol used in fuel cell vehicles and 8-36% in flexible-fuel or dedicated-methanol vehicles during the transition period. Methanol produced from natural gas and biomass, together in one process, and used in fuel cell vehicles would leverage petroleum displacement by a factor of about 5 and achieve twice the overall CO2 emission reduction obtainable from the use of biomass alone.

AB  - The nexus between natural resource depletion and environmental quality has been a heated topic of debate among policy experts in recent years. This nexus is crucial to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 which deals with climate change mitigation. However, the extant literature has not paid due attention to this nexus, particularly in the case of Mexico. Against this backdrop, the present study examines the relationship between ecological footprint and natural resource depletion, economic growth, energy consumption, technological innovation, and foreign direct investment in the Mexican economy. The present research leverages the novel dynamic autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) simulations approach and uses annual frequency data from 1980 to 2018. Empirical findings from the ARDL bounds test substantiate the presence of long-run association among studied variables. Furthermore, the result of the novel dynamic ARDL simulation does not validate the Environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. Thus, implying that Mexico's economy remains at the scale stage, with a scope of economic expansion relative to environmental quality. However, the Pollution Haven Hypothesis (PHH) is validated. Interestingly, natural resource rent accompanied with energy use and foreign direct investment deteriorate the environmental quality in the short-and long-run. However, technological innovation seems to emanate as a panacea for environmental degradation in the long-run. Result analysis also demonstrates that 10% positive and negative simulation graphs for the studied variables. The Frequency Domain Causality analysis also corroborates the above findings. These findings have far-reaching policy implications for Mexico's sustainable environment amid prudent use of natural resources, which are prescribed in the final section.

AB  - During the past century, the number and scale of reservoirs worldwide has grown substantially to meet the demand for water and hydropower arising from increased population, industrialization, and urbanization. This is particularly the case in China, where reservoir construction increased rapidly after the Chinese economic reform and the introduction of open-door policies. On average, 4.4 large reservoirs with a capacity greater than 0.1 km(3) were constructed per annum during the 1970s-1990s. This average reached 11.8 such reservoirs per annum in the 2000s. Considering the adverse impact of dams on rivers and riparian communities, various environmentalists and non-governmental organizations in China have begun to protest against the construction of dams. Now China's policy on dams is at a crossroads: Removal or further construction? In this paper, we systematically assess the construction of reservoirs in China and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of large-scale reservoir projects on several major rivers in China: The Yangtze River, the Yellow River and the Mekong River. Lastly, we provide a perspective on the future of reservoir development in China, taking into account natural conditions, renewable hydropower resources, and greenhouse gas emissions.

AB  - The fuel crisis with the slumping reserves of fossil fuels and the exponential increase in the demand of energy necessitate a paradigm shift to a more sustainable and eco-friendly energy system. Microalgal biofuel has been recognized as one of the most prominent and versatile alternative renewable energy sources because it can be converted into a wide array of biofuels, such as biodiesel, bioethanol, bioelectricity and biogases such as syngas, methane, hydrogen, and hythane etc., with a lower carbon emission profile. To attain the economic viability of algal fuels, a collective biorefinery approach addressing both the operational and technical limitations is quintessential. The current review critically analyzes and categorizes energy aspects of microalgae through various direct and indirect approaches with the perspective of a circular economy. These approaches include complicated thermochemical and biochemical processes integrating the recovery of a wide range of value-added products apart from biofuels, thus defining a cascading approach for a multiproduct-based biorefinery model. A glimpse of recent technological advancements comprising hybrid cultivation systems, prospects of co-culturing, and the role of automated/modeling approaches in the industrial-scale production of "algal-based bioenergy" is also discussed in detail. Further, the review has also scrutinized and highlighted the developments and bottlenecks in genetic and molecular aspects of strain improvement for bioenergy production. Furthermore, the study also correlated the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of producing this green energy by evaluating the prospects and pitfalls to obtain a holistic picture on this alternative fuel for a bio-based sustainable economy.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to examine the association between corporate governance mechanisms (board independence, board gender diversity, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) duality, and environmental, social and governance (ESG) linked compensation) and wastewater recycling as a strategy for managing the flow of microplastics into the aquatic environment. The study analysed an international sample of top companies on the Forbes 500 list over a 15-year period during the millennium development goals (MDGs) and sustainable development goals (SDGs) eras. Multiple regression analysis with fixed effect OLS, two-stage least squares regression, propensity score matching, and logistic regression were applied in the data analysis. The results show that, at the aggregate level, board gender diversity is positively associated with wastewater recycling, whilst CEO duality has a significant negative impact. When disaggregated into industries, board gender diversity is positively associated with wastewater recycling in high-polluting and low-polluting industries. In relation to the MDGs/ SDGs eras, the impact of board gender diversity is more significant in the MDGs era than in the SDGs era. At the geographical region level, CEO duality has a significant negative impact on wastewater management in the America and Asia Pacific regions, whilst the effect of CEO duality is significantly positive in the Western Europe region. We also find that a minimum of two female directors is required to improve wastewater management practice. The study concludes that whilst board gender diversity is a notable driver of wastewater management, CEO duality diminishes the commitment of multinational entities (MNEs) to addressing wastewater management issues. Our result is robust to (i) alternative measures of wastewater management, (ii) alternate sample composition, (iii) alternate method of data analysis, and (iv) endogeneity checks. The study contributes to the limited literature on waste management and the circular economy, particularly governance mechanisms' role in wastewater management in an international context.

AB  - Pollen analyses of a peat profile collected from Butterburn Flow, northern England have been used to reconstruct vegetation and land-use change from the late Neolithic (c. 3230 cal. BC) to the present day. 'Wiggle-matching'of 42 AMS C-14 dates has enabled a precise (decadal scale) chronology to be established, and the results are interpreted within the context of previous studies of vegetation change in the area. Three late Neolithic-Bronze Age woodland clearance phases occurred, with the first beginning c. 2290 cal. BC. Cleared areas were utilized for pastoral and limited arable agriculture. Late Iron Age clearance and agricultural intensification began at Butterburn Flow c. 300 cal. BC; the peak period of clearance c. 90cal. BC-AD 50cal. was comparable in intensity with that in the fourteenth century AD. Farmland in the area was abandoned during the period c. AD 90-450 cal., contemporaneous with the Roman occupation of the region; Following Roman withdrawal, a resurgence of agriculture occurred. The timing of later periods of agricultural decline relate to climatic deterioration, political instability and disease in the region.

AB  - The Alberta oil sands are a significant source of oil production and greenhouse gas emissions, and their importance will grow as the region is poised for decades of growth. We present an integrated framework that simultaneously considers economic and engineering decisions for the capture, transport, and storage of oil sands CO2 emissions. The model optimizes CO2 management infrastructure at a variety of carbon prices for the oil sands industry. Our study reveals several key findings. We find that the oil sands industry lends itself well to development of CO2 trunk lines due to geographic coincidence of sources and sinks. This reduces the relative importance of transport costs compared to nonintegrated transport systems. Also, the amount of managed oil sands CO2 emissions, and therefore the CCS infrastructure, is very sensitive to the carbon price; significant capture and storage occurs only above 110$/tonne CO2 in our simulations. Deployment of infrastructure is also sensitive to CO2 capture decisions and technology, particularly the fraction of capturable CO2 from oil sands upgrading and steam generation facilities. The framework will help stakeholders and policy makers understand how CCS infrastructure, including an extensive pipeline system, can be safely and cost-effectively deployed.

Field trials in Europe of Miscanthus x giganteus (Poales: Poaceae) over the past 20 years have shown that this plant is suitable for the production of biomass but the economic models promoting its use for this purpose often assume that controlling its pests will cost little or nothing. Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine whether this plant is suitable for the development of larvae of the western corn rootworm (WCR), Diabrotica virgifera virgifera (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), which is an important pest of maize. Larvae of WCR, originating from a Central and South Eastern European population, can develop on Miscanthus.

AB  - As per the commitment of COP-21, reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions under various production systems without affecting productivity is one of the important challenges in addressing global warming. To address this, environmentally and economically efficient climate resilient management practices were identified under the National Initiative on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) project and were implemented in the sixteen study villages of four districts of Eastern India. In this study, the GHG emissions in terms of C balance in tCO(2)eq due to the adoption of climate resilient practices in agriculture, livestock and forestry were estimated using the EX-ACT model that was developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN). EX-ACT tool was found to be an user-friendly and easy tool to assess the C balance in small areas with diverse climate and soil types. The findings of this study reveal that there is a sink due to the adoption of mitigation strategies (climate resilient management practices) in annuals, perennials and afforestration, while a source (emissions) was observed in irrigated rice, land use change and fertilizer use (inputs). When all the components were considered instead of a single component, the overall C balance in the study villages was found negative, suggesting a sink.

AB  - Preparation of an agreement has a great influence on economic success of both parties and on their behaviour in order to increase their profits and to protect themselves against a possible loss. It is important to use technological innovations in construction contracting. Even when the contractor is selected and the price and work terms are negotiated, it is possible to choose several variants of agreements. The aim of this article is to develop a hierarchical model of criteria of a construction contract agreement based on their functions. Construction contract agreements can he concluded, evaluated and compared on the basis of this model. The model forms the basis of decision support system for analysis of construction contracts. Decision support system created on the basis of the presented model can be very useful and helpful in construction contract agreement and can be widely implemented in different construction sectors.

AB  - Multinational corporations (MNCs) play an increasingly important role in the economic development strategies of many less developed countries (LDCs). At the same time the sustainable development of LDCs requires economic growth to be accompanied by environmental protection and greater social equity. This paper contributes to the literature concerned with MNCs' contribution to the sustainable development of LDCs. The concept of sustainable business practice (SBP) is proposed as relevant to understanding MNCs' contribution, and an analytical framework incorporating the content, context, and process of SEP is used to examine what SEP might consist of, as well as those conditions important for its widespread adoption. Results from a study examining the Colombian and Peruvian petroleum industries show that despite important contributions by MNCs to sustainable development, SEP is not yet widespread. The study also shows the importance of external institutional pressures-principally in the form of local legislation-for MNCs' contribution to the sustainable development of LDCs. Finally the paper shows how the process of change toward more SBP is closely linked to the external context in which MNCs operate, the characteristics of their internal context, and the internal and external processes linking these contexts.

AB  - In the mostly pristine Congo Basin, agricultural land-use change has intensified in recent years. One potential and understudied consequence of this deforestation and conversion to agriculture is the mobilization and loss of organic matter from soils to rivers as dissolved organic matter. Here, we quantify and characterize dissolved organic matter sampled from 19 catchments of varying deforestation extent near Lake Kivu over a two-week period during the wet season. Dissolved organic carbon from deforested, agriculturally dominated catchments was older (C-14 age: similar to 1.5 kyr) and more biolabile than from pristine forest catchments. Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry revealed that this aged organic matter from deforested catchments was energy rich and chemodiverse, with higher proportions of nitrogen- and sulfur-containing formulae. Given the molecular composition and biolability, we suggest that organic matter from deforested landscapes is preferentially respired upon disturbance, resulting in elevated in-stream concentrations of carbon dioxide. We estimate that while deforestation reduces the overall flux of dissolved organic carbon by approximately 56%, it does not significantly change the yield of biolabile dissolved organic carbon. Ultimately, the exposure of deeper soil horizons through deforestation and agricultural expansion releases old, previously stable, and biolabile soil organic carbon into the modern carbon cycle via the aquatic pathway.

AB  - In the coming century, anthropogenic climate change will threaten the persistence of restricted endemic species, complicating conservation planning. Although most efforts to quantify potential shifts in species' ranges use global climate model (GCM) output, regional climate model (RCM) output may be better suited to predicting shifts by restricted species, particularly in regions with complex topography or other regionally important climate-forcing factors. Using a RCM-based future climate scenario, we found that potential ranges of two California endemic oaks, Quercus douglasii and Quercus lobata, shrink considerably (to 59% and 54% of modern potential range sizes, respectively) and shift northward. This result is markedly different from that obtained by using a comparable GCM-based scenario, under which these species retain 81% and 73% of their modern potential range sizes, respectively. The difference between RCM- and GCM-based scenarios is due to greater warming and larger precipitation decreases during the growing season predicted by the RCM in these species' potential ranges. Based on the modeled regional climate change, < 50% of protected land area currently containing these species is expected to contain them under a future midrange "business-as-usual" path of greenhouse gas emissions.

AB  - Paired catchment approach probably provides the most robust method to detect the effects of land-use change on catchments' flow characteristics. This approach is limited by the availability of two neighbor catchments with and without land-use change under similar climate conditions. This paper uses a hydrological model to detect the hydrological change caused by urbanization. This study describes (1) use a statistical method to evaluate change detection relative to variation of land use change, (2) simulation of non-urban condition for the urban catchment with an alternative approach, to this aim stream flow series of urban catchments have been reconstructed from the period that urbanization had not taken place yet, and (3) the model validation with observed data. This paper intends to compare the flow changes detected by two different approaches: a regional statistical approach (the paired-catchment approach) and a conceptual modeling approach (the residual approach) on the particular case of urbanized catchments. To investigate the sensitivity of the results to the settings of both approaches, the comparison is made on a relatively large number of 43 catchments located in the United States, with relatively large gradients in terms of geomorphology and hydroclimatic characteristics. Results show that the two approaches are generally in relative good agreement in terms of detection and quantification of changes for the three flow characteristics analyzed (mean annual flow, high and low flow characteristics). Besides, it is found that the impact of urbanization on the catchment's hydrologic response is difficult to generalize: the proportion of nonsignificant trends, significantly increasing decreasing trends are on the same order of magnitude, even if an increase in urban areas generally has a greater impact on mean flows and high flows than on low flows.

AB  - Most estimations of residential water demand are based on single-equation models that rely on assumptions that are most often not compatible with the fundamental principles of consumer theory. In this paper, we relax these assumptions by using a more flexible system of demand estimation, the Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (QUAIDS) (Banks et al., 1997) and reveal the existence in our sample of substitution and complementary patterns as well as non-linearities in Engel curves for water consumption. Water demand would not be, therefore, linear in income and separable from other goods consumed within the household. In this context the QUAIDS functional specification is expected to be more consistent with observed consumer behavior. Our results seem to confirm this expectation; when compared to the linear, log-linear and double-log models commonly used in water demand estimation, QUAIDS seems to produce a better overall fit and a better fit to the asymmetric shape of the real distribution of water consumption. This has important implications in terms of public policy, as it allows to explore how water policies interact with other goods consumed within the household (e.g. water-energy nexus or efficient household appliances). Furthermore, differential responses to pricing policies and taxes across the income distribution can be considered, thus contributing to avoid undesired redistributive effects and water poverty.

AB  - The paper exploits large-scale administrative data to analyse trends in male earnings inequality in Luxembourg during 20 years of rapid economic growth, industrial redevelopment and massive inflow of foreign workers. A detailed error components model is estimated to identify persistent and transitory components of (the trends of) log-earnings variance and to disentangle the contributions to it of native, immigrant and cross-border workers. The model is flexible and allows for a high degree of individual, age, time and cohort heterogeneity. We observe a surprising stability in overall earnings inequality as a result of more complex underlying changes, with marked increases in persistent inequality (except among natives), a growing contribution of foreigners and a decrease in earnings instability (primarily for natives).

AB  - Since the shale Oil/Gas revolution, gas flaring and venting in the United States has garnered increasing attention. There is a pressing need to understand the spatial-temporal characteristics of gas flaring and track the associated greenhouse gas emissions. In this context, we use a thermal anomaly index (TAI) incorporating the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computation and local batch processing for monitoring gas flaring and characterizing its spatial-temporal dynamics. We then apply a quantitative analysis of satellite-based carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) in the gas flaring region. Here, we generate a gas flaring sites inventory in Texas from 2013 to 2022 based on > 83,500 multi-source moderate-resolution images (including 74,627 Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument [MSI] images and 8,969 Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager [OLI] images). Validations and comparisons demonstrate that our method is reliable for MSI and OLI images, with an overall accuracy of > 95 % and a low commission rate and omission rate. We detected 217,034 gas flares from 9,296 flaring sites in Texas, and the majority (>92 %) were found in the central and western regions of the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford Shale. The number of detected gas flaring sites vastly outnumbered the existing Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) fire products, with an upward trend from 2013 to 2019 and a downward trend from 2020 to 2022. Notably, the gas flaring sites dropped significantly at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (from December 2019 to May 2020), with the lowest average monthly growth rate of 14.38 %, and fell to the level of mid-2017. Application of gas flaring data identifies the localized greenhouse gas (GHG) emission hotspots in Texas and demonstrates that the increased effect of CH4 released from gas flaring regions was significantly stronger than that of CO2. These findings can provide references for monitoring similar small industrial sources in the future, can be used as an essential supplement to low-resolution fire products, and improve our understanding of CO2 and CH4 emissions from gas flaring at fine spatial scales.

AB  - Risk scenarios are caused by the convergence of a hazard with a potentially affected system in a specific place and time. One urban planning goal is to prevent environmental hazards, such as those generated by chemical accidents, from reaching human settlements, as they can cause public health issues. However, in many developing countries, due to their strategic positioning in global value chains, the quick and easy access to labor pools, and competitive production costs, urban sprawls have engulfed industrial areas, exposing residential conurbations to environmental hazards. This case study analyzes the spatial configuration of accidental chemical risk scenarios in three major Mexican metropolitan areas: Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey. Spatial analyses use an areal locations of hazardous atmosphere (ALOHA) dispersion model to represent the spatial effects of high-risk industrial activities in conurbations and the potentially affected populations vulnerable to chemical hazards. Complementary geostatistical correlation analyses use population data, marginalization indexes, and industrial clustering sectors to identify trends that can lead to comprehensive environmental justice approaches. In addition, the marginalization degree of inhabitants evaluates social inequalities concerning chemical risk scenarios.

AB  - While numerous studies report methane emissions from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in developed countries, few address emissions from plants in developing countries, where outdated technologies, such as the lack of enhanced primary and sludge treatment, are common. Moreover, these studies often rely on indirect calculations rather than direct measurements. Our study fills this gap by providing unit-process-level direct measurements of methane emissions in a conventional WWTP in Mexico, serving as a case study for developing countries. A standard plant was selected and visited on five occasions. It includes a primary settler, an aerated reactor, and a secondary settler, with no sludge treatment in place. Our findings revealed a CH4 emission factor of 0.396 +/- 0.218 g CH4 m-3 of treated water, with the primary settler accounting for 72.3 +/- 15.9% of emissions, and the aerated reactor contributing 27.7 +/- 15.9%. Notably, the emission factors are comparable to those reported for plants with more advanced treatment technologies, suggesting that technological obsolescence may not significantly enhance CH4 emissions. Methanotrophy in the aerated reactor was a key process, oxidizing 91-98% of the CH4 transported from the primary settler. Additionally, a carbon dioxide (CO2) emission factor of 97.4 +/- 34.4 g CO2 m-3 was measured, primarily from the aerated reactor, consistent with the plant's overall treatment efficiency. These findings provide crucial data for understanding greenhouse gas emissions from WWTPs in developing regions and highlight the need for targeted mitigation strategies.

AB  - Papermaking is a capital-intensive industry that requires a high consumption of plant fibers, energy, and water. Previous sustainability assessments of papermaking industry primarily focused on separate evaluations for multiple criteria without the integration for criteria and could not compare the overall priority of the production alternatives. The life cycle sustainability for the most representative boxboard production is analyzed as a case study in this work. Life cycle water consumption, energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and internal costs are selected as the assessment criteria. The two multi-criteria decision-making methods are applied to integrate the above criteria to obtain the sustainability sequence under different production pathways. When the papermaking enterprises are regarded as decision-makers, the alternative using waste paper as raw material to manufacture boxboard is the most sustainable, following by mixed fiber. The sustainability sequence of the alternatives using wood and straw as raw materials is controversial due to the different calculation models. Changing the proportion of raw materials and the criteria weights might adjust sustainability sequence of the alternatives.

AB  - Rural areas in the transition countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia are often excluded from the fruits of economic growth. In this paper it is argued that this exclusion goes beyond the mere rural-urban divide' caused by unequal income distribution. Social exclusion, measured by three dimensions, exclusion from economic life, exclusion from social services, and exclusion from civic life and social networks, is captured by an innovative multidimensional exclusion index (MEI), developed in the Regional Human Development Report. The empirical base for the MEI is a set of large household surveys in six transition countries, Kazakhstan, FYR Macedonia, Moldova, Serbia, Tajikistan, and Ukraine, held in the period September-November 2009, during the height of the economic crisis. Special emphasis is given to the location factor, showing that social exclusion is overall stronger in rural areas in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, in particular caused by the stronger influence of the second dimension, exclusion from social services, which includes access and quality to public utilities.

AB  - A dynamical wave model implemented over the North Pacific Ocean was forced with winds from three coupled global climate models (CGCMs) run under a medium-to-high scenario for greenhouse gas emissions through the twenty-first century. The results are analyzed with respect to changes in upper quantiles of significant wave height (90th and 99th percentile H-S) during boreal winter. The three CGCMs produce surprisingly similar patterns of change in winter wave climate during the century, with waves becoming 10-15 % smaller over the lower mid-latitudes of the North Pacific, particularly in the central and western ocean. These decreases are closely associated with decreasing windspeeds along the southern flank of the main core of the westerlies. At higher latitudes, 99th percentile wave heights generally increase, though the patterns of change are less uniform than at lower latitudes. The increased wave heights at high latitudes appear to be due a variety of wind-related factors including both increased windspeeds and changes in the structure of the wind field, these varying from model to model. For one of the CGCMs, a commonly used statistical approach for estimating seasonal quantiles of H-S on the basis of seasonal mean sea level pressure (SLP) is used to develop a regression model from 60 years of twentieth century data as a training set, and then applied using twenty-first century SLP data. The statistical model reproduces the general pattern of decreasing twenty-first century wave heights south of similar to 40 N, but underestimates the magnitude of the changes by similar to 50-70 %, reflecting relatively weak coupling between sea level pressure and wave heights in the CGCM data and loss of variability in the statistically projected wave heights.

AB  - The energy infrastructure for oil sands operations can be classified as a decentralized energy system, in which energy requirements (i.e., power, heat and hydrogen) are generated near the end-users, and can operate with interactions with the local Alberta grid, in which it feeds surplus power generated to it. In this study, a mathematical optimization model is developed for the integrated planning and scheduling of the energy infrastructure of the oil sands industry. The contributions of various energy sources including conventional, renewables, and nuclear are investigated. Power-to-gas for energy storage is incorporated to manage surplus power generated from intermittent renewable energy sources, particularly wind. The wind-electrolysis system included incorporates two hydrogen recovery pathways, which are power-to-gas and power-to-gas-to-power using natural gas generators. The problem is modeled as a multiobjective and multiperiod mixed integer linear programming model that minimizes the system cost (energy production and storage), grid cost, and total greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to including the grid cost and emissions in the objective function, grid-interaction is incorporated in the optimization model through the unit commitment operations of the existing power generation units of the grid. The proposed model is designed to evaluate the optimal operation and sizing of the energy producers and the energy storage system as well as the interactions between them. The epsilon constraint method is used to solve the multiobjective aspect of the proposed model. To illustrate its applicability, the model is applied to a case study based on the oil sands industry in Alberta for the integrated planning and scheduling of its energy infrastructure for the year 2017.

AB  - This paper presents an optimization modeling approach to support strategic planning for designing hydrogen supply chain (HSC) networks. The energy source for hydrogen production is proposed to be electricity generated at Mexican sugar factories. This study considers the utilization of existing infrastructure in strategic areas of the country, which brings several advantages in terms of possible solutions. This study aims to evaluate the economic and environmental implications of using biomass wastes for energy generation, and its integration to the national energy grid, where the problem is addressed as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), adopting maximization of annual profit, and minimization of greenhouse gas emissions as optimization criteria. Input data is provided by sugar companies and the national transport and energy information platform, and were represented by probability distributions to consider variability in key parameters. Independent solutions show similarities in terms of resource utilization, while also significant differences regarding economic and environmental indicators. Multi-objective optimization was performed by a genetic algorithm (GA). The optimal HSC network configuration is selected using a multi-criteria decision technique, i.e., TOPSIS. An uncertainty analysis is performed, and main economic indicators are estimated by investment assessment. Main results show the trade-off interactions between the HSC elements and optimization criteria. The average internal rate of return (IRR) is estimated to be 21.5% and average payback period is 5.02 years.

AB  - Regional multisector partnerships involving stakeholders in areas such as public health, health care, education, housing, and others are growing in number. These partnerships are pursuing increasingly comprehensive strategies to transform health and well-being in their communities. Most analyses of these groups rely on self-reports and case studies. These have led many in the field to form optimistic expectations about how well prepared the groups are to lead transformative efforts-that is, how " mature" they are. Few studies have systematically combined data from multiple perspectives to assess partnership characteristics against specific developmental criteria. In 2015-16 we gathered 145 nominations of regions (places) and partnerships with reputations for being relatively mature. Using a three-step assessment procedure, informed by eighty-five interviews with close observers and ten site visits, we found that most of these groups lacked certain characteristics that seem necessary to transform regional health systems. Even the more mature groups were not as well poised for transformation as their reputations implied. Our findings can help correct misperceptions and clarify ways to best support further partnership development.

AB  - Due to the rapid increase in environmental degradation and depletion of natural resources, the focus of researchers is shifted from economic to socio-environmental problems. Blockchain is a disruptive technology that has the potential to restructure the entire supply chain for sustainable practices. Blockchain is a distributed ledger that provides a digital database for recording all the transactions of the supply chain. The main purpose of this research is to explore the literature relevant to blockchain for sustainable supply chain management. The focus of this review is on the sustainability of the blockchain-based supply chain concerning environmental conservation, social equality, and governance effectiveness. Using a systematic literature review, a total of 136 articles were evaluated and categorized according to the triple bottom-line aspects of sustainability. Challenges and barriers during blockchain adoption in different industrial sectors such as aviation, shipping, agriculture and food, manufacturing, automotive, pharmaceutical, and textile industries were critically examined. This study has not only explored the economic, environmental, and social impacts of blockchain but also highlighted the emerging trends in a circular supply chain with current developments of advanced technologies along with their critical success factors. Furthermore, research areas and gaps in the existing research are discussed, and future research directions are suggested. The findings of this study show that blockchain has the potential to revolutionize the entire supply chain from a sustainability perspective. Blockchain will not only improve the economic sustainability of the supply chain through effective traceability, enhanced visibility through information sharing, transparency in processes, and decentralization of the entire structure but also will help in achieving environmental and social sustainability through resource efficiency, accountability, smart contracts, trust development, and fraud prevention. The study will be helpful for managers and practitioners to understand the procedure of blockchain adoption and to increase the probability of its successful implementation to develop a sustainable supply chain network.

AB  - This paper explores the potential role of bioenergy coupled to carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage (BECCS) in long-term global scenarios. We first validate past insights regarding the potential use of BECCS in achieving climate goals based on results from 11 integrated assessment models (IAMs) that participated in the 33rd study of the Stanford Energy Modeling Forum (EMF-33). As found in previous studies, our results consistently project large-scale cost-effective BECCS deployment. However, we also find a strong synergistic nexus between CCS and biomass, with bioenergy the preferred fuel for CCS as the climate constraint increases. Specifically, the share of bioenergy that is coupled to CCS technologies increases since CCS effectively enhances the emissions mitigation capacity of bioenergy. For the models that include BECCS technologies across multiple sectors, there is significant deployment in conjunction with liquid fuel or hydrogen production to decarbonize the transportation sector. Using a wide set of scenarios, we find carbon removal to be crucial to achieving goals consistent with 1.5 degrees C warming. However, we find earlier BECCS deployment but not necessarily greater use in the long-term since ultimately deployment is limited by economic competition with other carbon-free technologies, especially in the electricity sector, by land-use competition (especially with food) affecting biomass feedstock availability and price, and by carbon storage limitations. The extent of BECCS deployment varies based on model assumptions, with BECCS deployment competitive in some models below carbon prices of 100 US$/tCO(2). Without carbon removal, 2 degrees C is infeasible in some models, while those that solve find similar levels of bioenergy use but substantially greater mitigation costs. Overall, the paper provides needed transparency regarding BECCS' role, and results highlight a strong nexus between bioenergy and CCS, and a large reliance on not-yet-commercial BECCS technologies for achieving climate goals.

AB  - Mycotoxins are a group of naturally occurring toxic chemical substances, produced mainly by microscopic filamentous fungal species. Regarding potential synergisms or even mitigating effects between toxic elements, mycotoxin contamination will continue to be an area of concern for producers, manufacturers, regulatory agencies, researchers, and consumers in the future. In Serbia, recent drought and then flooding confirmed that mycotoxins are one of the foodborne hazards most susceptible to climate change. In this article, we review key aspects of mycotoxin contamination of the food supply chain and implications for public health from the Serbian perspective.

AB  - In this study, greenhouse gas emissions and microbial community succession during the realization of the partial nitrification (PN) process were studied. The results show that N2O emission mainly occurred in the aerobic stage and the PN reactor released about 20 mg of N2O gas each cycle. There is a positive correlation between the dissolved N2O concentration and the temperature of a typical cycle. High-throughput sequencing was used to illustrate succession in the microbial community structure. The most significant microfloral change during the PN startup process was that some aerobic bacteria were relatively enriched and some anaerobic bacteria were weeded out. The ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) like Nitrosomonadaceae were enriched on account of the suitable external environment. Pseudomonas whose main function is denitrification declined and Planctomyces (anammox) showed the same tendency. This study comprehensively demonstrates the fluctuations of dissolved and emitted N2O while researching the succession of the microbial community in the culture of the PN process.

AB  - Coastal and marine ecosystems supply multiple services in which human well-being is highly dependent. However, high-resolution spatial distribution studies of marine ecosystem services are scarce, even if it is known that this information is needed to better manage and conserve these ecosystems. With the aim of filling this gap, in this study we have: (1) mapped and assessed the current capacity of marine phanerogams (Posidonia oceanica, Cymodocea nodosa, Zostera noltii, Zostera marina, and Halophila decipiens) to store and sequester blue carbon in Spain; (2) mapped and assessed the future capacity of marine phanerogams to store and sequester blue carbon under three plausible futures; and (3) assess the economic implications of these scenarios. Our results are based on the InVEST Blue Carbon model and exhibit high spatial resolution (100 m/pixel) of carbon stored in marine phanerogams. We found that 82% of carbon storage and sequestration by marine phanerogams is currently managed within Natura 2000 areas. However, results from the modeled future scenarios indicate a constant decrease in the amount of carbon stored in these ecosystems by 2050 (24% lost in the business-as-usual scenario). The economic impact of these losses is equivalent to 17,974 million euro (around 1.6% of the Spanish GDP). Finally, we consider that a transformative management change is needed to conserve marine phanerogams in Spain, and we discuss the importance of the Natura 2000 Network in managing marine ecosystems and their services in the near future.

AB  - In order to develop broader scientific discussions, the authors analyze a contemporary social phenomenon in the field of sustainability-the modernisation of the country in order to preserve the ecosystem, emphasizing one of the most important aspects of modernisation-the context of economic environmental sustainability. Underscoring the importance of this study, the research problem was identified by answering the questions of how the modernisation of the country manifests itself in the context of economic environmental sustainability and what are the consequences for the society. This article examines the factors behind the country's modernisation through the lens of its citizens. The purpose is to analyze the development of modernisation in Lithuania from the perspective of a sustainable economic environment and to form a complex system of indicators for the formation of an effective governance of a modern country. The paper is based on a quantitative empirical study to support the structural perspective of modernisation of the country, to justify an integrated system of indicators for the formation of a modern country following an analysis of the country's modernisation trends in terms of the economic environment. The scientific value of the study: the presents paper investigates the main determinants of economic environmental sustainability of the country (effectiveness of digitalisation, infrastructure, environment, and interoperability of natural resources); behavior in line with environmental trends of the EU and subjective factors (interest in opportunities and benefits of renewable energy) was investigated; provides a methodological framework for the methods used (descriptive statistics, factor analysis (FA) and path analysis (PA). A representative cross-sectional survey of 1015 respondents are selected as main research tool. Lithuania (Case Study) served as an empirical basis for the research.

AB  - Recent IPCC assessments highlight a key role for large-scale carbon removal in meeting the objectives of the Paris Agreement. This focus on removal, also referred to as negative emissions, is suggestive of novel opportunities, risks, and challenges in addressing climate change, but tends to build on the narrow techno-economic framings that characterize integrated assessment modeling. While the discussion on negative emissions bears important parallels to a wider and older literature on carbon sequestration and carbon sinks, this earlier scholarship-particularly from the critical social sciences-is seldom engaged with by the negative emissions research community. In this article, we survey this "long history" of carbon removal and seek to draw out lessons for ongoing research and the emerging public debate on negative emissions. We argue that research and policy on negative emissions should proceed not just from projections of the future, but also from an acknowledgement of past controversies, successes and failures. In particular, our review calls attention to the irreducibly political character of carbon removal imaginaries and accounting practices and urges acknowledgement of past experiences with the implementation of (small-scale) carbon sequestration projects. Our review in this way highlights the importance of seeing continuity in the carbon removal discussion and calls for more engagement with existing social science scholarship on the subject. Acknowledging continuity and embracing an interdisciplinary research agenda on carbon removal are important aspects in making climate change mitigation research more responsible, and a precondition to avoid repeating past mistakes and failures.

AB  - Predominant objective of macroeconomic policies in developing countries has been to achieve higher level of potential economic growth and sustain it once it is achieved. Macroeconomic policy in India, on the backdrop of severe balance of payment crisis, has witnessed major shift in the early 1990s when neo-liberal economic policy on the pressure of IMF and World Bank has been adopted abandoning the socialist pattern of economic policy pursued in the post-independence period. Since implementation its scope has been consistently widening in terms of economic reform in different sectors of the economy, now its impact both positive and adverse is clearly visible. Since the last two and half decades, the serious adverse implication of the new economic policy is visible, particularly on the widening income inequality, although there has been positive effect on achieved higher aggregate economic growth. The major channel through which it is manifested is less than desired performance on labour market as employment generation has slowed down drastically when compared to the long-term trend in employment generation. In post-1991 period during 1993-1994 and 2011-2012, the growth in employment has been around 1.3% per annum against long-term growth rate of 2.11% per annum between 1977-1978 and 2011-2012. Even those employments generated are mostly in construction and low-productive services sector and are precarious and casual in nature. The paper has contributed in understanding the phenomena of rising inequality in the nature of production, through examination of structure and composition of output, employment and emerging wide disparity across sectors. We have shown by examining output per worker and concentration of workforce across sectors the problem of existing and rising income inequality.

AB  - Gas extraction is a practical and effective way to guarantee mining-process safety and deliver greater environmental benefits through reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increase the supply of a valuable clean gas resource. It has been effective in recent years, however it still has a series of problems that need to be solved. Gas extraction design mainly relies on engineering experience rather than quantitative design, resulting in low input-output ratio of gas extraction because of unreasonable design. How to build a bridge of communication between engineers and scientists is the key to realize scientific gas extraction. In this work, taking our previous gas-coal and gas-coal-heat coupling models of gas extraction as the theoretical basis, a new communication and design concept-an engineering design platform for gas extraction-is proposed using the network mode. Through the platform, on- and off-line interactions between service centre (scientific workers) and design objects (enterprises or individuals), such as data transmission, material review, scheme design and reviews, and so on. It greatly improves the efficiency and standardization of gas extraction design. Appling the networked platform, the gas extraction engineering parameters were quantitatively designed in the working face of 3307, Tangan colliery. According to the extraction time, the working face was divided into 6 extraction units. The number of boreholes were 763, the drilling capacity of coal was 0.03 m/t, and the extraction rate of each unit was more than 25%. The networked mode of in-seam gas extraction design would transform the traditional experience to the quantitative mode.

AB  - Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are fundamental to cellular signaling and transduction which marks them as attractive therapeutic drug development targets. What were once considered to be undruggable targets have become increasingly feasible due to the progress that has been made over the last two decades and the rapid technological advances. This work explores the influence of technological innovations on PPI research and development. Additionally, the diverse strategies for discovering, modulating, and characterizing PPIs and their corresponding modulators are examined with the aim of presenting a streamlined pipeline for advancing PPI-targeted therapeutics. By showcasing carefully selected case studies in PPI modulator discovery and development, we aim to illustrate the efficacy of various strategies for identifying, optimizing, and overcoming challenges associated with PPI modulator design. The valuable lessons and insights gained from the identification, optimization, and approval of PPI modulators are discussed with the aim of demonstrating that PPI modulators have transitioned beyond early-stage drug discovery and now represent a prime opportunity with significant potential. The selected examples of PPI modulators encompass those developed for cancer, inflammation and immunomodulation, as well as antiviral applications. This perspective aims to establish a foundation for the effective targeting and modulation of PPIs using PPI modulators and pave the way for future drug development.

AB  - The future of land use and cover change in Brazil, particularly due to deforestation and forest restoration processes, is critical for the future of global climate and biodiversity, given the richness of its five biomes. These changes in Brazil depend on the interlink between global factors due to its role as one of the main exporters of commodities globally and the national to local institutional, socioeconomic, and biophysical contexts. Aiming to develop scenarios that consider the balance between global (e.g., GDP growth, population growth, per capita consumption of agricultural products, international trade policies, and climatic conditions) and local factors (e.g., land use, agrarian structure, agricultural suitability, protected areas, distance to roads, and other infrastructure projects), a new set of land-use change scenarios for Brazil were developed that aligned with the global structure Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCPs) developed by the global change research community. The narratives of the new scenarios align with SSP1/RCP 1.9 (Sustainable development scenario), SSP2/RCP 4.5 (Middle of the road scenario), and SSP3/RCP 7.0 (Strong inequality scenario). The scenarios were developed by combining the LuccME spatially explicit land change allocation modeling framework and the INLAND surface model to incorporate the climatic variables in water deficit. Based on detailed biophysical, socioeconomic, and institutional factors for each biome in Brazil, we have created spatially explicit scenarios until 2050, considering the following classes: forest vegetation, grassland vegetation, planted pasture, agriculture, a mosaic of small land uses, and forestry. The results aim to detail global models regionally. They could be used regionally to support decision-making and enrich the global analysis.

AB  - The use of small-scale generation based on disparate new and renewable technologies is becoming more prevalent due to the imperative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are thought to be the chief cause of climate change. As penetration of these distributed elements increases, displacing central generation, there is a growing need to understand the composite behaviour of groups of Distributed Generation (DG) devices, also known as Virtual Power Plants (VPPs). This paper presents an overview of the mathematical modelling of the VPP leading to the development of a user-friendly tool that can be used as a power system engineering teaching aid to demonstrate the characteristics of VPPs.

AB  - The well-being of the human society cannot be ensured and sustainable unless the flow of Ecosystem Services (ESs) would be matching with their consistent demand. The consistent flow of ESs required sustainable management of ecological resources of the ecosystem. The management of ecosystem can be ensured with variety of approaches. Integration of indigenous ecological knowledge (IEK) in management prescription with the view that IEK-based extraction of ESs ensures removal of resources from the ecosystem within the limit thereby ensuring the sustainability of ecosystem. The present study is an evaluation to understand the nexus between ESs and IEK for sustainable environmental management. The focus of the study was a tribal dominated socio-ecological patch of Barind Region of Malda district, Eastern India. The assessment of ESs and IEK was based on the data collected from the randomly selected tribal households following the pre-tested questionnaire containing questions on ESs as per millennium ecosystem assessment. The data were analyzed following social preference approach, and statistical tests (Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney). General linear model (GLM) has also been used to examine the impact of socio-demographic attributes on the perceived valuation of ESs. The results revealed that the provisioning ESs (such as water, fuel wood, medical plants) were most preferred followed by cultural and regulating ESs by tribal. Differential importance of ESs was observed among tribal and accounted by gender, education as well as age of the tribe. A gap between the actual accessibility and evaluation of ESs by the tribal communities was also apparent. The socio-demographic attributes have an immense impact on the valuation of ESs and also governed based on the IEK. Various types of indigenous ecological belief systems were closely linked with conservation of ecosystem and sustainable supply of ESs. The present study can contribute to understand socio-ecological nexus with the lens of IEK in tribal dominated ecological landscapes for improved ecosystem and environmental management besides ensuring sustainability of flow of ESs.

AB  - Self-help organizations (SHOs) enable patients with chronic health conditions (PCHCs) to overcome common difficulties through the exchange of knowledge and mutual assistance, which serves as the basis for promoting the self-reliance and well-being of PCHCs. Nevertheless, practical challenges persist because little is known about what and how to evaluate for the developmental outcomes of SHOs. To address this knowledge gap, the present study seeks to develop and validate the Self-Help Organization Development Scale (SHODS). A total of 232 core members from 54 SHOs in Hong Kong participated in our study. The SHODS structure was validated by confirmatory factor analysis. This analysis derived five factors: citizen support, business support, member recovery and mutual aid, organizational health, and functional sustainability. The five-factor structure demonstrated stability across various types of SHOs, as validated by the subgroup analysis based on two criteria: duration of SHO establishment and organization affiliation. Good concurrent validity was supported by significant correlations between the SHODS factors and organizational variables, including staff supervision, staff understanding, networking, advocating, and educating the public and patients. The SHODS also showed excellent internal consistency. In conclusion, the SHODS is a psychometrically sound instrument for measuring the developmental outcomes of SHOs.

AB  - New Rural Area Program (Nong thon moi) has been being promoted in Vietnam successful certified "standard new rural areas", following the sustainability direction in rural areas in the world. The overall goal of the central government in Vietnam pictures a new rural area development scheme with environmental sustainability and socio-cultural identity. However, it might not be easy for policy implementation to totally match the initial goal. This paper studies the case of Quang Nam's reports on new rural area development and finds out that while the middle-term goals of developing rural areas' infrastructure and reducing poverty are well reached, a long-term goal of building up rural areas' environment and community for sustainable purposes might not yet be fulfilled. The criteria of new rural area in Vietnam is a top-down ambitious list of every aspect becoming better but the community participation into the program has been limited. Using the results from the case study and applying the "sense of place" theory, the paper recommends an approach of enhancing community's sensitivity and attachment to their place which, as a result, increases their willingness to protect and develop their place toward economic, socio-cultural and especially environmental sustainability.

AB  - Landfill aeration can accelerate the biological degradation of organic waste and reduce methane production; however, it induces nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas. Nitrification is one of the pathways of N2O generation as a by-product during aerobic condition. This study was initiated to demonstrate the features of N2O production rate from organic solid waste during nitrification under three different temperatures (20 degrees C, 30 degrees C, and 40 degrees C) and three oxygen concentrations (5%, 10%, and 20%) with high moisture content and high substrates' concentration. The experiment was carried out by batch experiment using Erlenmeyer flasks incubated in a shaking water bath for 72h. A duplicate experiment was carried out in parallel, with addition of 100Pa of acetylene as a nitrification inhibitor, to investigate nitrifiers' contribution to N2O production. The production rate of N2O ranged between 0.40x10(-3) and 1.14x10(-3) mg N/g-DM/h under the experimental conditions of this study. The rate of N2O production at 40 degrees C was higher than at 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C. Nitrification was found to be the dominant pathway of N2O production. It was evaluated that optimization of O-2 content is one of the crucial parameters in N2O production that may help to minimize greenhouse gas emissions and N turnover during aeration.

AB  - The Anthropocene is characterized by close interdependencies between the natural Earth system and the global human society, posing novel challenges to model development. Here we present a conceptual model describing the long-term co-evolution of natural and socio-economic subsystems of Earth. While the climate is represented via a global carbon cycle, we use economic concepts to model socio-metabolic flows of biomass and fossil fuels between nature and society. A well-being-dependent parametrization of fertility and mortality governs human population dynamics. Our analysis focuses on assessing possible asymptotic states of the Earth system for a qualitative understanding of its complex dynamics rather than quantitative predictions. Low dimension and simple equations enable a parameter-space analysis allowing us to identify preconditions of several asymptotic states and hence fates of humanity and planet. These include a sustainable co-evolution of nature and society, a global collapse and everlasting oscillations. We consider different scenarios corresponding to different socio-cultural stages of human history. The necessity of accounting for the 'human factor' in Earth system models is highlighted by the finding that carbon stocks during the past centuries evolved opposing to what would 'naturally' be expected on a planet without humans. The intensity of biomass use and the contribution of ecosystem services to human well-being are found to be crucial determinants of the asymptotic state in a (pre-industrial) biomass-only scenario without capital accumulation. The capitalistic, fossil-based scenario reveals that trajectories with fundamentally different asymptotic states might still be almost indistinguishable during even a centuries-long transient phase. Given current human population levels, our study also supports the claim that besides reducing the global demand for energy, only the extensive use of renewable energies may pave the way into a sustainable future.

AB  - Compared with other forest systems, research interest in the potential for a stronger ecosystem carbon sequestration of evergreen forests throughout subtropical China has greatly increased. The eddy covariance technique is widely employed to determine accurate forest-atmosphere carbon dioxide (CO2) flux, which is subsequently used to determine forest ecosystem carbon exchange characteristics. The Dinghushan Biosphere Reserve, a subtropical monsoon evergreen broad-leaved forest, is a suitable study area due to its warm and humid climate (compared with other regions within the same latitude), consequently playing a role in the carbon cycle in the region. For this study, we hypothesized that the forest land in this region generally acts as a carbon sink, and that its carbon sequestration capacity increases over time despite the influence of climatic factors. Here, we compared net CO2 flux data derived from the eddy covariance technique over an 8-year study window. Additionally, we ascertained the effects of various environmental factors on net CO2 flux, while also using the Michaelis-Menten model and a physiologically based process model to track and report on ecosystem carbon exchange characteristics. We observed seasonal trends in daily ecosystem flux, indicative of sensitivity to climatic factors, such as air temperature, precipitation, and sunlight. The carbon sequestration capacity of the region exhibited seasonal variability, increasing from October to March (-264 g C m(-2) year(-1), i.e., 48.4%) while weakening from April to September (-150 g C m(-2) year(-1), i.e., 40.4%) on average. The net ecosystem exchange (NEE) rate varied from -518 to -211 g C m(-2) year(-1); ecosystem respiration (Re) varied from 1,142 to 899 g C m(-2) year(-1); and gross primary production (GPP) varied from 1,552 to 1,254 g C m(-2) year(-1). This study found that even though the Dinghushan Biosphere Reserve generally acts as a carbon sink, its carbon sequestration capacity did not increase significantly throughout the study period. The techniques (models) used in this study are suitable for application in other ecosystems globally, which can aid in their management and conservation. Finally, the Dinghushan Biosphere Reserve is both an exemplary and a model forest system useful in exploring CO2 absorption and sequestration from the atmosphere.</p>

AB  - This paper contributes to the existing but scarce literature on customer-centric sustainability and measures consumers' perceptions of fast-fashion brands regarding economic, environmental, and social sustainability. Furthermore, it aims to test the impact of each dimension of customer-brand relationships, specifically brand trust, affective brand commitment, and continuance brand commitment. A research model and nine hypotheses were tested through multiple linear regressions using a convenience sample of 228 Portuguese fast-fashion consumers. It also provides additional insights into how consumers' perceptions of the three dimensions of sustainability might affect customer-brand relationships, namely brand trust and brand commitment. The results reveal a significant relationship between all dimensions of customer-centric sustainability and brand trust. Furthermore, economic sustainability and social sustainability were found to significantly predict effective brand commitment.

AB  - The aim of the article is to analyze and evaluate technical efficiency scores of public sector banks (PSBs) in India. The study also determines the nature of return to scale (RTS) of individual banks and thereby identifies the leaders and laggards in the PSBs. To measure the extent of overall technical efficiency, pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency (SE), the non-parametric approach, that is, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is used to determine the causes of inefficiency. The sample of the study includes 26 PSBs operating in India during the time period from 2007-2008 to 2011-2012. The results show that although the PSBs have more or less similar efficiency scores, that is, higher than 0.900, still out of 22 banks falling in the category of efficient banks in 2007-2008, only 7 of them were left by the year 2011-2012. Overall analysis of PSBs during the time period of the study explains that a greater part of inefficiency among PSBs is attributed to scale inefficiency. In addition, the number of banks operating at constant return to scale (CRS) came down to 9 in 2011-2012 from 23 in 2007-2008. Simultaneously, there was a reduction in leaders and increase in laggards. It is suggested that banks must optimize their scale of operations and adopt technological innovations.

AB  - In-pit crushing and conveying (IPCC) and ore sorting are two developing technologies that, in addition to providing likely economic benefits, also have the potential to reduce the greenhouse gas footprint of mining and mineral processing operations. A life cycle assessment study was carried out to provide estimates of the likely greenhouse gas reductions from the implementation of IPCC and ore sorting technologies in a hypothetical copper mining and mineral processing operation. Based on the assumed configurations and operating characteristics of the two systems, the results indicated that IPCC had 4% less (i.e. 3 kg CO(2)e/t ore or 0.16 kg CO(2)e/t ore.km) greenhouse gas emissions than truck haulage for the base case configuration. Using electricity generated from natural gas rather than black coal increased the greenhouse gas advantage of IPCC over truck haulage from 4% to about 22% (i.e. 14 kg CO(2)e/t ore or 0.74 kg CO(2)e/t ore.km). However, transport distance and annual plant feedrate affect the magnitude of these greenhouse gas reductions. A potential reduction of about 13 kg CO(2)e/t ore in greenhouse gas emissions was estimated from the use of ore sorting technology based on black coal generated electricity, while with natural gas-based electricity the reduction was only 8 kg CO(2)e/t ore. The mass rejection rate of the ore sorting device was the main operational variable affecting the magnitude of this reduction, although it is also affected by the specific comminution and concentration energy requirements of the ore. While the results indicate that ore sorting offers nearly four times the potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions than IPCC did at the same annual plant feedrate for the base case configuration with black coal-based electricity, the situation was reversed with natural gas-based electricity, with IPCC offering nearly double the potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions than ore sorting. However, it should be appreciated that due to the limited amount of publicly available data on these technologies at the present time, the results of this study should be viewed as first estimates only.

AB  - Although kindergarten children are the group of citizens who will face the consequences of today's environmental challenges, research on their knowledge about environmental sustainability is limited. In June 2019, we interviewed 56 children (five to six years old) from eight kindergartens in Norway and asked kindergarten staff and the children's parents to fill out a short questionnaire. The aim of the study was to investigate children's knowledge of how our actions affect the natural environment and children's self-declared sense of belonging to nature. Our results show that upon completing kindergarten, many children had gained an early understanding of environmental sustainability. Garbage disposal, deforestation, and air pollution from vehicles were the environmental issues children were most aware. We detected a positive association between time spent in nature with parents and children's knowledge; this emphasizes the importance of children spending time in nature with their parents.

AB  - Advancing models for accurate estimation of food production is essential for policymaking and managing national plans of action for food security. This research proposes two machine learning models for the prediction of food production. The adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) methods are used to advance the prediction models. In the present study, two variables of livestock production and agricultural production were considered as the source of food production. Three variables were used to evaluate livestock production, namely livestock yield, live animals, and animal slaughtered, and two variables were used to assess agricultural production, namely agricultural production yields and losses. Iran was selected as the case study of the current study. Therefore, time-series data related to livestock and agricultural productions in Iran from 1961 to 2017 have been collected from the FAOSTAT database. First, 70% of this data was used to train ANFIS and MLP, and the remaining 30% of the data was used to test the models. The results disclosed that the ANFIS model with generalized bell-shaped (Gbell) built-in membership functions has the lowest error level in predicting food production. The findings of this study provide a suitable tool for policymakers who can use this model and predict the future of food production to provide a proper plan for the future of food security and food supply for the next generations.

AB  - Hydrogen is an alternative to conventional heavy marine fuel oil following the initial strategy of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Although hydrogen energy has many advantages (zero-emission, high efficiency, and low noise), it has considerable fire and explosion risks due to its thermal and chemical characteristics (wide flammable concentration range and low ignition energy). Thus, safety is a key concern related to the use of hydrogen. Whereas most previous studies focused on the terrestrial environment, we aim to analyze the effects of the ship's motion on hydrogen dispersion (using commercial FLUENT code) in an enclosed area. When compared to the steady state, our results revealed that hydrogen reached specific sensors in 63% and 52% less time depending on vessel motion type and direction. Since ships carry and use a large amount of hydrogen as a power source, the risk of hydrogen leakage from collision or damage necessitates studying the correspondence between leakage, diffusion, and motion characteristics of the ship to position the sensor correctly.

AB  - The population of Laos PDR has increased rapidly in recent years, reaching 2.5% per annum. This growth threatens food security, which in Asia is often equated with rice production. The country has to feed almost 50% more people now than 16 years ago. The role of aquatic rice field species in rural Laotian diets has been underestimated, as almost 200 species are consumed, supplying a range of nutrients needed by the villagers. Nevertheless, national and regional food composition databases contain limited information on the nutritional composition of these species. Field sampling was undertaken in Champasak and Savannakhet provinces for nine species of aquatic animals, including fish, amphibians, crustaceans, molluscs and insects. Four samples of fermented fish products were included. The objective was to gain knowledge on the nutritional composition of the aquatic species included in Laotian diets. The aquatic animals consumed on a daily basis contained high amounts of protein (11.6-19.7% for fish, crustaceans, molluscs, amphibians and insects and 3.3-7.8% for fermented fish), and a generally acceptable essential amino acid profile. They were also excellent sources of calcium, iron and zinc. However, they had low contents of fat (0.1-4.6%), fatty acids and vitamin A. Essential amino acids, iron and zinc are nutrients that are scarce in rural Laotian diets. As the food supply of rural households in rice farming areas of Laos is critically dependent on the environment, the sustainable existence of the rice field aquatic animals is a crucial factor for the nutritional status of the Laotians.

AB  - Forest carbon sequestration, resulting in increased carbon storage in forests, is an effective tool for climate change mitigation. Nonindustrial private forest (NIPF) landowner participation is crucial for increasing carbon stocks in the southern United States forests. Carbon sequestration is a relatively new practice, so NIPF land-owners are expected to have varied adoption responses depending on their different internal (socioeconomic, financial, and forest structure factors) and external (environmental, governmental policy, and market factors) environments. This study identified major obstacles for NIPF participation in carbon sequestration and grouped landowners into adoption categories with respect to carbon sequestration using the diffusion of innovations model. Principal component analysis was used to identify five major obstacles to participation in carbon sequestration programs: revenue implications, forest characteristics, owner preferences, normative reasons, and understanding. NIPF landowners were grouped into three adoption categories: adopters (18%), majority (60%) and laggards (22%). The adopters, compared to the other categories, were richer, more educated, relatively younger, and owned larger landholdings. These results provide a valuable insight about the adoption behavior of NIPF landowners with respect to climate change mitigation programs in the southern United States. Program planners and outreach professionals should consider these NIPF landowner adoption categories and the role of peer landowners in promoting new programs and policies for developing effective mitigation strategies.

AB  - Ocean warming threatens the provisioning of coral reef ecosystem services through the increasing frequency and intensity of coral bleaching and associated mortality events. Here, we quantified sea surface temperature warming trends and maximum annual degree heating weeks (DHW) from the NOAA Coral Reef Watch CoralTemp station-level data for Puerto Rico (1985-2023) and paired this with a review of coral bleaching observations to inform management and restoration efforts. Every region in Puerto Rico warmed at rates surpassing the hypothesized 0.10 degrees C per decade rate of coral adaptation and acclimatization, with warming rates increasing from 0.154 +/- 0.005 degrees C per decade in the west to 0.215 +/- 0.006 degrees C per decade in the east. Ecologically significant (DHW >= 4) or severe (DHW >= 8) coral bleaching heat stress events were observed in 2005-2006, 2010, 2019, and 2023, but varied in intensity between regions with consistently lower heat stress in the west. We found coral bleaching observations for 50% of years since 1969, but many observations lacked quantitative information and/or were biased towards the major areas of reef development. The National Coral Reef Monitoring Program island-wide stratified random sampling recorded moderate and/or severe coral bleaching at multiple sites in 2019 and 2021, but not for 2014 or 2016/2017. While regional variability in warming rates, heat stress, and climate model projections provide some indications for increased climate resilience in the west, coral bleaching observations and previous resilience assessments highlight the importance of local-scale variability. Climate models nonetheless project annual severe bleaching (DHW >= 8) across Puerto Rico by 2022 +/- 5 under the very high greenhouse gas emissions scenario.

AB  - Research has shown an association between proactive adoption of environmental management practices and firm performance; however little of this research, particularly in the small firm context, has examined the impact of human resources management (HRM) practices on that association. Using data drawn from a sample of 158 small firms in the Australian machinery and equipment-manufacturing sector, this article contributes an empirical test of the moderating effect of HRM on the association between proactive environmental management and firm financial performance. In so doing, we draw on the concept of 'Green' HRM; that is to say, practices aligned with environmental sustainability goals and which aim at developing employees' abilities, motivation and commitment, and involvement in support of those goals at the firm level. The findings reveal that Green HRM positively moderates the association between proactive environmental management and financial performance, such that a high level of Green HRM increases the financial benefits of proactive environmental management compared with low levels of Green HRM. The findings show the added value that Green HRM provides when used as an enabler of proactive environmental management; this study should help allay concerns of small firms about the potential cost burden they may face from increasing governmental and social demands for environmental sustainability.

AB  - Fire is one of the major issues facing Southeast Asian peatlands causing socio-economic, human health and climate crises. Many of these fires in the region are associated with land clearing or management practices for oil palm plantations. Here we study the direct post-fire impacts of slash-and-burn oil palm agriculture on greenhouse gas emissions, peat physico-chemical properties and nutrient concentrations. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were measured using Los Gatos ultraportable greenhouse gas analyser one month after a fire in dry season and five months after the fire event, in wet season. Surface soil samples were collected from each individual GHG measurement points, along with 50 cm cores from both burnt and non-burnt control areas for lab analyses. As an immediate post-fire impact, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions, pH, electrical conductivity, and all macronutrient concentrations except nitrogen (N) were increased multi-fold, while the redox potential, carbon (C) and N content were greatly reduced in the burnt region. While some of the properties such as CO2 emissions, and electrical conductivity reverted to normal after five months, other properties such as CH4 emissions, pH and nutrient concentrations remained high in the burnt region. This study also found very high loss of surface peat C content in the burnt region post fire, which is irreversible. The results also show that surface peat layers up to 20 cm depth were affected the most by slash-and-burn activity in oil palm agriculture, however the intensity of fire can vary widely between different oil palm management and needs further research to fully understand the long term and regional impacts of such slash-and-burn activity in tropical peatlands.

AB  - Unravelling how biodiversity is maintained despite species competition for shared resources has been a central question in community ecology, and is gaining relevance amidst the current biodiversity crisis. Yet, we have still a poor understanding of the mechanisms that regulate species coexistence and shape the structure of assemblages in highly competitive environments such as carrion pulsed resources. Here, we study how large vertebrates coexist in scavenger assemblages by adapting their diel activity at large ungulate carcasses in NW Spain. We used camera traps to record vertebrate scavengers consuming 34 carcasses of livestock and hunted wild ungulates, which allowed us to assess also differences regarding carcass origin. To evaluate tem-poral resource partition among species, we estimated the overlap of diel activity patterns and the mean times of each scavenger at carcasses. We recorded 16 species of scavengers, 7 mammals and 9 birds, and found similar richness at both types of car-casses. Birds and mammals showed contrasting diel activity patterns, with birds using carcasses during daytime (mean= 11:38 h) and mammals mostly at night (23:09 h). The unimodal activity patterns of scavengers showed asynchronous peaks among species. Subordinate species modified their activity patterns at carcasses used by apex species to reduce temporal overlap. Also, diel activity patterns of vultures closely followed those of corvids, suggesting facilitation processes in which corvids would enhance carcass detection by vultures. Two mammal species (12.5%) increased nocturnality at carcasses of hunted ungu-lates, which could be a response to human disturbance. Our results suggest that both temporal segregation and coupling mediate the coexistence of large vertebrates at carcasses. These mechanisms might lead to richer scavenger assemblages and thereby more efficient ones in driving critical ecosystem functions related to carrion consumption, such as energy and nutrient recycling and biodiversity maintenance.

AB  - Amendments of olive orchard soil with two different preparations of olive mill solid waste (OMWMS) at the rate of 9 ton ha(-1) per year for five years in two different plots were compared with art industry Standard soil amendment using urea. Both the OMWMs amendments showed significant increases ill total organic carbon and humic Substances in soil of approximately 40% and 58%, respectively, without negative effects on tree growth and yield. This work has shown that olive oil mill waste (OMW) can be recycled safely using the bioremediation system used in this study. We Suggest that this system is particularly beneficial to organic farming and is an alternative solution to direct spreading of raw OMW on farm lands. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, we employ a directional distance function to estimate the opportunity cost arising from environmental regulations in China's industrial sector. The change of opportunity cost is decomposed mathematically into two components including technical change and input change. Our results show that the opportunity cost attributed to environmental regulation is nil in some regions. The change of opportunity cost is marginal at the national level, as the positive effect of technical change is canceled out by the negative impact of input change on opportunity cost. Built on our mathematical decomposition, we further estimate the effects of environmental regulations on opportunity cost using a mediation model. It shows that environmental regulation has a significantly positive direct effect and a significantly negative indirect effect through foreign direct investment on opportunity cost. Our findings suggest, firstly, that inward FDI in China's industrial sector represents relatively dirty production technology; and, secondly, industrial production has transited towards a less carbon-intensive input mix. This paper, therefore, provides new insights for the recent dynamics of carbon abatement performance of China's industrial sector with policy implications.

AB  - Massive deforestation induced by unplanned urbanization in the hilly watersheds of Brahmaputra basin, India, has led to ecological imbalance and is gradually transforming this basin into a multi-hazard zone. Removal of green cover is also becoming a matter of global concern, as it can accelerate the adverse impacts of climate change. People coming in search of work generally reside in the hills, as they cannot afford the high cost of land in plains. This has led to deforestation of the hilly area and has resulted in increased surface erosion from the upper catchments. Though sediment and water yield from these degraded watersheds could have been minimized by implementing ecologically sustainable management practices (EMPs), such as grass land, forest land and detention pond, poor economic conditions of the people stands in the way of field implementation. On the other hand, major industries, which can be held responsible for emission of greenhouse gases, can be asked to finance greenery development in these hilly watersheds through implementation of selected EMPs to earn carbon credit for them. To convert this concept into reality, the EMP combination must be selected in such a way that it restricts sediment and water yield from the watershed within the permissible limit and maximizes its carbon sequestration capacity at minimum possible cost. Such optimal planning is a prerequisite for preparing an acceptable logical agreement between Government and private companies. Keeping this in mind, an optimization model was developed and applied to a micro watershed of Guwahati to explore its applicability in actual field. The model developed in this study provides most logical carbon credit negotiation, subject to the availability of reliable value of CO2 sequestration for different EMPs.

AB  - This paper explores a methodology to locate battery energy storage systems (BESS) in rural alternating current (AC) distribution networks fed by diesel generators to minimize total greenhouse gas emissions. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is formulated to represent the problem of greenhouse gas emissions minimization, considering power balance and devices capabilities as constraints. To model the BESS systems, a linear relationship is considered between the state of charge and the power injection/consumption using a charging/discharging coefficient. The solution of the MINLP model is reached through the general algebraic modeling system by employing the BONMIN solver. Numerical results in a medium-voltage AC distribution network composed of 33 nodes and 32 branches operated with 12.66 kV demonstrate the effectiveness of including BESS systems to minimize greenhouse gas emissions in diesel generators that feeds rural distribution networks.

AB  - Housing units in the United States account for 18% of the total greenhouse gas emissions and 58% of public-supply water consumption. These negative environmental impacts of housing units can be reduced by integrating green building measures and fixtures, such as geothermal heat pumps and water-saving plumbing fixtures. The integration of these green measures often leads to an increase in the initial costs of the housing units, and therefore decision makers need to study and optimize the potential trade-offs between the environmental performance of housing units and their initial costs. This paper presents a multiobjective optimization model that is capable of optimizing housing design and construction decisions to generate optimal trade-offs between maximizing the environmental performance of housing units and minimizing their initial costs. The model was designed to maximize housing environmental performance during its operational phase by reducing its greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption. The model was developed in two main phases that formulated and implemented the model with the use of multiobjective genetic algorithms to provide the capability of generating Pareto optimal trade-offs between housing cost and environmental performance. Analysis of an application example is presented to demonstrate the use of the model and its capabilities in identifying Pareto optimal configurations of housing design and construction decisions. The primary contributions of this research to the body of knowledge include its comprehensive set of metrics and novel methodology that can be used to measure and quantify the impact of the design and construction decisions of housing units on their environmental performance, including greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption, and its novel multiobjective optimization methodology that is capable of generating Pareto optimal trade-offs between the environmental performance of housing units and their initial costs.

The objective of the problem is to minimise bunker consumption cost, ship operating cost, ship charterage and either the carbon tax or the revenue/cost of selling/purchasing CO2 emissions permits. We formulate the problems as non-linear programmes by considering the two regulations independently. This study also suggests Lagrangian heuristics to solve the problems. A case study is performed to evaluate the applicability of the heuristics.

AB  - The cementitious technique shows great potential as a solidification/stabilization treatment in the disposal of municipal solid waste incineration fly ash (MSWIFA). The utilization of MSWIFA as a supplementary cementitious material (SCM) offers the potential to substitute cement, thereby mitigating greenhouse gas emissions associated with conventional cement production. However, the lower active silicon content in MSWIFA diminishes its pozzolanic properties as an SCM. This paper explores a green and efficient pre-treatment approach for raw MSWIFA, and the treated MSWIFA was utilized as a SCM. The nano SiO2-modified MSWIFA cement-based composite (NMCC) was prepared by incorporating silicon-rich nano SiO2 (NS) to enhance the properties of the cementitious composite containing MSWIFA. The effects of MSWIFA content, water-to-binder ratio, and NS content on the NMCC were investigated in regards to its mechanical properties (compressive and flexural strength), fresh properties (fluidity and dynamic yield stress), and greenhouse gas emission (embodied carbon). The proportion and performance of NMCC were optimized by orthogonal experimental design. Range and variance analysis were applied to obtain the optimal formulation of NMCC. The findings suggest that NS can serve as an additional source of silicon to insufficient strength of cement-MSWIFA composites, which is attributed to the inadequate presence of silicon elements in MSWIFA. The comprehensive index analysis identified the NMCC with 15 wt% MSWIFA, 0.45 water-to-binder ratio, and 1.0 wt% NS as the optimal proportion. The optimal NMCC reduces embodied carbon by 38.91 kg CO2e/m3 compared to the cement control group, and can be effectively utilized in low-carbon buildings and engineering applications.

AB  - In several countries around the world, the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energies is considered an inevitable trend for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the protection of the environment. It also helps to minimize dependence on fossil fuels which are exhausted over time. In Cameroon, the use of renewable energies appears as an alternative for commercial companies which depend enormously on the public sector which is the only supplier of electricity thanks to hydroelectric dams. Installing solar power systems and wind power systems can help businesses and industrial facilities directly use electricity generated from clean energy sources. Moreover, the need to reduce electricity costs and to move toward solutions that improve the environment from being polluted is felt. In this article, the results of an optimization study for a cement plant in Garoua Province, Cameroon, show that the hybrid wind and solar grid-tied energy systems in Scenario 1 are considered more efficient; on the environmental, economic and technical level than the solar energy systems connected to the electrical grid in scenario 2. The robustness and feasibility of this system thanks to the Homer Pro software and the optimization by particle swarm shows a reduction in the cost of the installation as well as a contribution to the protection of the environment. The optimal configuration of the hybrid power system connected to the grid includes wind energy with a capacity of 300 kW and solar energy with a capacity of 1500 kW, this system has a net present cost (NPC) of 5,596,978 USD, the cost of energy (COE) of 0.0847 USD/kWh, the investment cost of 1,140,000 USD and the operating cost of 384,877 USD.

AB  - In recent years, stricter environmental regulations, as well as an increased public concern, have progressively forced new landfills to be located more and more away from urban centers. This has stimulated the use of solid waste transfer stations, where the solid waste is transferred from small collection vehicles to large transportation vehicles. In this paper, we tackle the problem of determining the routes for both collection and transportation vehicles, as well as their synchronization at the transfer stations. We divide the problem into two phases and propose an exact approach utilizing a mathematical formulation, as well as a constructive heuristic and a matheuristic for the first phase, and a heuristic approach for the second phase. Computational results show that the approach combining the matheuristic for the collection phase with the heuristic for the transportation phase is able to achieve consistent reductions in terms of number of collection vehicles needed.

AB  - This study investigates a cultivation strategy for the macroalga Colaconema formosanum by determining optimal inorganic carbon concentration and salinity for maximizing biomass and photosynthetic pigment production while also facilitating carbon sequestration. The response surface method was used with a central composite design (CCD-RSM) to determine the optimal conditions. Results showed that adding 1.2 g/L of carbon increased the specific growth rate to 18%-19% per day. The maximum amount of pigment, including phycobiliprotein and chlorophyll, was achieved by adjusting both carbon content and salinity. This strategy enables mass pigment production and offers an eco-friendly approach to carbon sequestration while reducing culture period. This study also sheds light on algal mechanisms against enriched inorganic carbon and salinity content, contributing to an enhanced understanding of these vital processes.

AB  - Groundwater pollution risk modelling is an important asset to improve groundwater management and protection. In this study, we assess the temporal dynamics of groundwater pollution risk at the continental scale, using the DRASTIC model. The approach was developed using continental-scale data on soil properties, topography, land use, geology, hydrogeology, and climate with a resolution of 15 x 15 km(2). We compared continental-scale groundwater pollution risk for the years 1990, 2000, and 2010. The results showed significant inter-annual variations of the spatial distribution of pollution risk. Changes were mainly concentrated in the area of the Nile Delta, around the Lake Victoria, in North Africa, and in coastal West Africa (predominately in Nigeria). We found that the increase in pollution risk was mainly related to the increase in the population density in these regions. The proposed methodology for modelling the temporal dynamics of groundwater pollution risk could support the monitoring of the Sustainable Development Goal 6, which focus in particular on the preservation of the freshwater resources against future threats.

AB  - Reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the shipping sector is a challenging task. While renewable fuels stand out as the most promising long-term solution, their near- and mid-term viability is hampered by limited availability and high costs. An alternative approach is onboard carbon capture, which can reduce emissions from new ships as well as retrofitted vessels. This paper examines the techno-economic potential of oxyfuel combustion based carbon capture on ships. The oxyfuel concept uses an oxygen-rich atmosphere in the combustion process, resulting in a mixture of carbon dioxide and water. After the condensation of water, the carbon dioxide rich gas can be directly stored on board. Various onboard oxygen supply concepts are investigated, including different technologies for onboard air separation and liquid oxygen bunkering. Influences on the ship energy system are studied by system simulation of a deep-sea container vessel. Benchmarked against a technologically mature post-combustion carbon capture system, the results show that the oxyfuel concepts have limited competitiveness because of reduced engine efficiencies and high energy demands for onboard oxygen supply. Avoiding onboard oxygen supply by using liquefied oxygen as a byproduct from onshore electrolysis increases energy efficiency and the competitiveness of oxyfuel combustion but requires additional storage space. Sensitivity analyses highlight that the engine combustion concept and engine efficiency are the most critical influences on the techno-economic performance.

AB  - Because of the first observations in the 1900s of the oligotrophic and eutrophic states of lakes, researchers have been interested in the process that makes lakes become turbid because of high phytoplankton biomass. Definitions of eutrophication have multiplied and diversified since the mid-20th century, more than for any other ecological process. Reasons for the high number of definitions might be that the former ones did not sufficiently describe their causes and/or consequences. Global change is bringing eutrophication more into the spotlight than ever, highlighting the need to find consensus on a common definition, or at least to explain and clarify why there are different meanings of the term eutrophication. To find common patterns, we analyzed 138 definitions that were classified by a multiple correspondence factor analysis (MCA) into three groups. The first group contains the most generic scientific definitions but many of these limit the causes to increased nutrient availability. A single definition takes into account all causes but would require additional work to clarify the process itself. Nutrient pollution, which is by far the primary cause of eutrophication in the Anthropocene, has generated a second group of environmental definitions that often specify the primary producers involved. Those definitions often mention the iconic consequences of nutrient pollution, such as increased algal biomass, anoxia/hypoxia and reduced biodiversity. The third group contains operational definitions, focusing on the consequences of nutrient pollution, for ecosystem services and therefore associated with ecosystem management issues. This group contains definitions related to regulations, mainly US laws and European directives. These numerous definitions, directly derived from the problem of nutrient pollution, have enlarged the landscape of definitions, and reflect the need to warn, legislate and implement a solution to remedy it. Satisfying this demand should not be confused with scientific research on eutrophication and must be based on communicating knowledge to as many people as possible using the simplest possible vocabulary. We propose that operational definitions (groups 2 and 3) should name the process "nutrient pollution," making it possible to refine (scientific) definitions of eutrophication and to expand on other challenges such as climate warming, overfishing, and other nonnutrient-related chemical pollutions.

AB  - The paper presents the analysis of the statistical data on population and real estate in 20 small-to-medium-sized cities in Northern Italy and shows a high rate of vacancy of housing and significant shrinkage of businesses and institutions in the historic centres, where urban heritage is concentrated. Given these findings, the paper analyses the official city plans of the cities with the worst underutilisation conditions, to understand how the plans have reacted to the decline of the centre. The result shows the extensive planning and regulation activity has very limitedly registered the phenomenon and failed to propose the empty inner cores as resources to reduce land consumption and recycle valuable assets in a circular economic vision. Combining the statistical data and the findings from the city plans, the paper concludes that Italian historic centres are living paradoxesa collection of beauty, icon of well-being, model of sustainability, but abandonedand therefore, the dense regulatory mechanisms that were necessary to conserve urban heritage during the decades of economic and demographic growth must be reframed to implement a circular economy and adapt to new requirements for living conditions.

AB  - Due to the excessive use of natural resources and fossil fuels, our planet has started to show its weak points. Several ecological and economic crises have occurred in the last decades. The building sector is held primarily responsible for one-third of global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, and the advent of COVID-19 has not improved this with its containment. For this reason, improving the energy efficiency of buildings and reaching the net zero concept have become the primary objectives of all policies. Several measures are to be undertaken to achieve this concept, ranging from passive and active strategies to the use of renewable energy. This work aims to analyse and study the morphology of the building with geometric plan and height variables to know their influences on the energy consumption of residential buildings in three different types of Algerian climates, semi-arid, arid, and Mediterranean. Using SketchUp and the cloud-based simulation tool Sefaira, the results showed that the triangular-shape based plan has the best energy consumption, allowing a reduction of 18% from the worst-case scenario, and that the difference in height can save up to 17.5%, which is worth 51 kWh/m2/year.

AB  - The red-eared slider turtle, Trachemys scripta elegans, is among the most over-exploited animals and is still exported annually from the USA all over the world. Once introduced into its new environment, feral populations may arise and pose threats to local biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. In France, it is in fact considered as a risk for the Mediterranean pond turtle, Mauremys leprosa, and the European pond turtle, Emys orbicularis, as they may compete for resources and habitat. Freshwater turtles are also host to a variety of parasites including protozoans and helminths. When introduced turtles escape, parasites may spread to native species. The objective of this study was to document the extent of platyhelminth invasions from T. s. elegans to natural M. leprosa populations in northern Spain and southern France and to evaluate the risks that parasite host-switching may pose on indigenous freshwater turtle species. From DNA barcoding analysis based on the sequencing of the Cytochrome c Oxidase I gene, the Bayesian tree and p-distance comparisons of closely related haplotypes revealed a greater polystome richness within M. leprosa than expected, suggesting that host switching may take place in natural environments. Because these parasites most typically infest American turtles like Chrysemys picta marginata and Graptemys pseudogeographica in their natural home range and because parasites were also found within T. s. elegans feral populations, it is suggested that the red-eared slider would serve as a carrier for a variety of not strictly host-specific polystomes that are transmitted to M. leprosa throughout the south of France. The global trade in freshwater turtles thus provides opportunity for parasites to be transported to new destinations which could impact the physiology, behavior and survival of native turtle species.

AB  - Background: Eurasian Sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus) increasingly represent successful city-dwellers. Thereby, a rich food supply indicated by high numbers of small birds is believed to be the key driver for this bird-eating rap- tor species to settle in urban environments. However, as small passerine birds show particularly strong antipredator responses, sparrowhawks may not simply focus on patches of highest prey densities, but rather respond strategically to prey behavior, raising the importance of other parameters in determining the occurrence within urban landscapes. Methods: To deepen our knowledge on habitat requirements of urban sparrowhawks, bird surveys were carried out during winter between December 2005 and January 2017 in 36 city parks in Vienna, Austria. Besides food supply also park size, canopy heterogeneity and the connectivity with other green spaces were considered. Results: Occurrence of sparrowhawks was positively affected by increasing park size, prey density and the interaction between both. Bird feeder density and park connectivity with other green spaces were of minor importance in explaining the presence of this species. Canopy heterogeneity didn't affect city park occupancy by Eurasian Sparrowhawks. Conclusions: Our results suggest that large city parks, particularly when characterized by high prey densities, substantially contribute to protect and preserve ecologically important bird species such as raptors within the urban environment-a landscape already struggling with biodiversity losses and functional homogenization.

AB  - Considering the rapid changes in land use in tropical countries and the difficulties of law enforcement in remote areas, management of ecosystems benefits from the landscape approach. Within the landscape approach it is important to assess the different livelihoods of the local populations, as well as the vulnerability of the ecosystems that are supporting these livelihoods. Specifically for wetlands in rural tropical areas that face fast developing agro-industrial land use change, there is little information available on the attitude of stakeholders considering the ecosystems they manage. We used a combination of participatory rural appraisal and participatory mapping methods on rural wetlands in the Amazonian Piedmont region in Colombia, an area that has hardly ever been studied. We found that 77.7 % of the current livelihoods depend directly on the provisioning ecosystem services delivered by the wetlands, where fishing and hunting are the most important services that contribute to the household income. Ecotourism, which is emerging as a promising source of income, was also pointed as one key ecosystem service. However, our results revealed that the wetlands in our study area are very vulnerable (up to 41 % endangered). The main causes for wetland deterioration were cattle ranching, invasive grasses, deforestation, drainage, and burning. We conclude with a brief overview on the pros and cons of reconciling wetland conservation and human development in sensitive regions such as the Amazonian Piedmont in Colombia and other similar regions in the Tropics.

AB  - The reshaping of South African cities is being guided by policies aiming to build socially and environmentally just communities. Despite widespread commitment to this goal, there is little consensus on what it means and how it should and could translate into practice. The paper shows that despite the emphasis on environmental justice and building sustainable communities in policy, the institutional context for implementation (including expert driven and deliberative approaches) do not always deliver on this mandate. Consequently, policy outcomes do not reflect those of the communities and households it is meant to serve, raising challenging moral and ethical questions for institutions involved in environmental governance. This paper shows how the institutional context of environmental assessment combined with the role played by the values held by environmental practitioners charged with influencing decision-making result in the perpetuation of environmental injustices. The lack of a clearly defined profession and professional body, reflecting a diversity of values, debating, regulating, defining and defending a set of principles to guide decision-making in cities is identified as a possible reason for the lack of congruence between the values reflected in policy with those held by the communities these interventions are intended to serve. The resulting value added by sustainable cities interventions in the light of this mismatch is therefore questionable, raising challenges regarding international calls for local action as well as an increasing policy focus in South Africa on the local level as the agent of political and spatial transformation of cities.

AB  - Under the aspect of strict environmental regulations, hydrotropy is accepted as an environmentally friendly ("green") approach to solubilise hydrophobic compounds. Above the minimum hydrotrope concentration (MHC), hydrotropes are capable of self-aggregation; the MHC is considered the minimum requirement for solubilisation. In this article a comprehensive overview of the aggregation behaviour of different hydrotropes is presented. Details about the methods used for aggregation are given. The role of additives is discussed with respect to their influence on the MHC. Thermodynamic studies are used to evaluate the stability of a hydrotrope at different temperatures. A modern approach to the solubilization mechanism using hydrotropes is also presented in this review article. The aim of this article is to provide guidance for conducting such studies on a number of hydrotropes.

AB  - Previous research focuses on factors that influence self-employment participation, in part because entrepreneurship has been associated with economic growth. This literature has tended to focus only on men or the comparison of women to men, while ignoring substantial heterogeneity in employment decisions among women. By investigating the impact of individual, household, and local economic and cultural characteristics on the labor market outcomes of different groups of women, we get a more comprehensive picture of their self-employment decision. Recognizing self-employment as one of multiple labor market choices, we use multinomial logit and two confidential, geocoded micro-level datasets to study women`s career choices in urban areas. We find that the effects of various push and pull factors differ between married and unmarried women. In particular, more progressive gender attitudes pull married women into self-employment, while household burdens associated with children push them into self-employment. For unmarried women, the local business climate and individual characteristics have the strongest influence. In both cases, the motivations for women are quite different than men.

AB  - Production of methane and carbon dioxide as well as methane concentrations in surface waters and emissions to the atmosphere were investigated in two flow-through lake complexes (Uzlina-Isac and Puiu-RosuRosulet) in the Danube Delta during post-flood conditions in May and low water level in September 2006. Retained nutrients fuelled primary production and remineralisation of bioavailable organic matter. This led to an observable net release of methane, particularly in the lakes Uzlina, Puiu and Rosu in May. Input from the Danube River, from redbuds and benthic release contributed to CH4 concentrations in surface waters. In addition to significant river input of CO2, this trace gas was released via aerobic remineralisation within the water column and in top sediments. Emission patterns of CO2 widely overlapped with those of CH4. Generally, greenhouse gas emissions peaked in the lake complex adjacent to the Danube River in May due to strong winds and decreased with increasing hydrological distance from the Danube River. Intense remineralisation of organic matter in the Danube Delta lakes results in a net source of atmospheric greenhouse gases.

Gender analysis contributes to our understanding of: (1) vulnerability and climate change impacts; (2) adaptations in different contexts; (3) responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions; (4) inequalities in climate governance; and (5) knowledges and social action on climate change. Overall, the literature has established that gender relations are an integral feature of social transformations associated with climate change. This poses a challenge to gender-blind social research into climate change. Without gender analysis, we omit key aspects of social life in a changing climate. It is vital that the gendered character of climate change is recognized and further explored in the social sciences and humanities. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - This paper aims to investigate the impact of influential ESG factors on risk, focusing on debt risk and liquidity risk. The influence on a sample of companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange belonging to the NYSE index is analyzed over a 10-year period, 2012-2021. The quantitative framework covers a multitude of indicators regarding debt, liquidity, corporate governance, the environment, CEO characteristics, performance, and other variables, and the research methodology uses the method of least squares to highlight their impact, using regression models with fixed and random effects, both linear and nonlinear. By estimating regression models, the empirical results confirm the hypotheses found in the existing knowledge stage that debt risk and liquidity risk are significantly influenced by asset profitability, the CEO duality significantly influences debt, while CEO gender diversity has a negative influence on corporate risk, specifically debt and liquidity risk. Additionally, it is shown that the emergence of COVID-19 brings significant changes to company autonomy and their financial performance, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively influenced corporate risk through restrictions, economic uncertainty, and the amplification of risks. These research results are crucial for practitioners by the necessity of integrating ESG criteria into the risk assessment process and decision-making. Furthermore, concerning policy decision-makers, they help promote sustainability and a responsible approach. Therefore, ESG factors can impact companies' financial performance and influence how they are perceived by investors. By understanding and correctly evaluating these ESG factors, one can identify and manage risks more efficiently, achieve better long-term returns, make appropriate decisions, and promote sustainability in the business environment.

AB  - Producing actionable science to improve social and environmental well-being enables the scientific enterprise to uphold expectations that accompany public funding for science. While innovations in the management of science funding may help overcome institutional hurdles to generating actionable science, the role of program managers in implementing such changes is relatively underexamined. Using sustainability science and related fields as a case, this study examines program documents (n = 33) and interviews of program management staff (n = 61) from public science funding programs in the United States and Europe. The results illuminate program management perspectives on the changing relationship between science and society and their own role in shaping it. In many instances, program managers in both regions are actively experimenting with practices that may strengthen links between knowledge and action. In certain contexts, program manager discretion may also amount to a form of science policy formation. However, program managers may still be limited in their ability to enact changes due to capacity constraints and still prevalent norms expressed by the research community. These results provide a window, and basis for future research, into the contemporary practice of science funding program management and its implications for sustainability and the social contract for science.

AB  - The attention towards residents' perceptions of ecosystem services for an efficient management of rural landscapes is gaining momentum. One noteworthy aspect is the identification of links between perceived supply and societal demand of ecosystem services, as they can disclose leverages to improve rural policies. The objectives of this study are: i) to assess residents' perceptions of ecosystem services attributed to typical landscape elements; and ii) to characterise the perception of different groups of residents. We present the results from a residents' survey based on a phone-questionnaire carried out in a reclaimed coastal area, where vulnerabilities such as anthropic impact legacies and natural hazards are exacerbated. The aim of the questionnaire concerns the collection of information regarding people perception of benefits attached to a set of rural landscape elements and demand for services. The results show that awareness of regulating functions, the presence of disservices and the link with local food production relate with residents' perception of benefits from landscapes. Furthermore, we note that local landscape and the meaning attributed to historical land reclamation initiatives has a lasting influence on the perception of ecosystem services and that of such perceptions are significant for the design of land use policies.

AB  - Purpose - Although awareness of environmental sustainability has increased over the past few decades, the current market share of sustainable products remains low. Because of their market position, large-scale and high-volume consumer interactions, food retailers are appropriate venues to entice consumers to buy more sustainable foods. The purpose of this paper is to examine the extent to which food retailers are perceived to have embedded sustainability initiatives in their marketing strategies and to have taken sustainable tactical measures on the store floor. In addition, the study considered the roles played by social identification (SI) and by perceived external prestige (PEP). Design/methodology/approach - Based on a literature review and semi-structured qualitative interviews with the chief executive officers (CEOs) of Dutch food retailers, the authors conducted an online panel survey among the managers of these food retailers. Findings - The results of the study show the positive impacts of managers' SI with a sustainable consumer group and managers' PEP on the perceived environmental sustainability initiatives of Dutch food retailers. The study finds that managers' SIs are powerful ways to engender employee loyalty. Moreover, organisations that are perceived to have more external prestige are perceived as being more capable of developing sustainability policies. Originality/value - The current study combines views from CEOs of large Dutch food retailers with supermarket manager's perceptions of sustainability initiatives on a strategical and tactical level of an organisation. It uses insights from CSR, food retail and SI theory literature to explain these perceptions.

AB  - Modern bioenergy technologies have been recognized as one of the potential energy sources in Nepal to address the current energy crisis and contribute to the rural development. Nepalese foresters play an important role in the natural resource management sector of Nepal. Their perceptions can be important considering their experiences in the forestry sector and awareness of the local situations especially in the remote and rural areas of Nepal. Therefore, the study through a questionnaire-based survey aimed to explore their perceptions of bioenergy development in Nepal including the policy issues. Total 65 Nepalese foresters were interviewed for the study working for various forestry related government organizations located in Kathmandu, Nepal. The study found that the Nepalese foresters perceived positively the importance of bioenergy development in Nepal for employment and rural income generation, and improving the current energy situation by supplying locally produced and affordable energy sources. The respondents held community participation in the future bioenergy projects as a key to its successful implementation in Nepal. However, there is a strong need, as perceived by the respondents, to formulate a separate bioenergy policy for Nepal. Among various policy interventions formulation of a new bioenergy policy, mobilizing community participation in bioenergy projects, developing bioenergy markets, and implementing new bioenergy projects were considered as urgent for Nepal.

AB  - Space cooling demand is increasing globally due to climate change. Cooling has also been linked to all 17 sustainable development goals of the United Nations. Adequate cooling improves productivity and thermal comfort and can also prevent health risks. Meanwhile, policy initiatives such as the European Union's Green Deal require participants to cut greenhouse gas emissions and reduce energy use. Therefore, novel cooling systems that are capable of efficiently producing high levels of thermal comfort are needed. Radiant cooling systems provide a design capable of fulfilling these goals, but their application in hot and humid climates is limited due to the risk of condensation. In this study, we compare the performances of radiant cooling systems with and without dehumidification. The studied systems are supplied by geothermal energy. The study is conducted using building energy models of a small office building belonging to a three-building school complex located in Sant Cugat near Barcelona in Spain. The studied location has a Mediterranean climate. The simulations are conducted using IDA Indoor Climate and Energy 4.8 simulation software. The results show that the radiant cooling system with dehumidification (RCD) produces considerably improved thermal comfort conditions, with maximum predicted mean vote (PMV) reached during the cooling season being 0.4 (neutral) and the maximum PMV reached by the radiant cooling system without dehumidification (RC) being 1.2 (slightly warm). However, the improved thermal comfort comes at the cost of reduced energy and exergy efficiency. The RCD system uses 2.2 times as much energy and 5.3 times as much exergy as the RC system. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to assess the influence of selected input parameters on the simulation output. The results suggest that maximising dehumidification temperature and minimising ventilation flow rate can improve the energy and exergy efficiency of the RCD system while having a minor effect on thermal comfort.

AB  - With global efforts underway to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect the world's finite oil sources, the advent of electric vehicles (EVs) has emerged as a viable solution to address these imperatives. The present study endeavors to establish a comprehensive framework for investigating the implications of EV integration within medium voltage distribution networks, considering both normal and faulty scenarios. Additionally, the study explores the impact of distributed generation units (DGs) on this integration. The impact assessment entails evaluating power losses and the total voltage stability index (TVSI) as indicators of normal system performance. In the case of abnormal conditions, the analysis shifts to examining fault currents. Notably, the study is conducted considering the uncertainty associated with both the loading ratio (LR) and the random power consumption of EVs during fast charging. To address this uncertainty, the proposed approach employs Hong's-Point Estimate Method (PEM), specifically utilizing the (2m+1) scheme. This methodology is applied to IEEE 69-bus and 85-bus systems using MATLAB software, supplemented by ETAP short circuit analysis to validate the results. In order to verify the framework, different locations of charging stations along the systems' buses are tested with varying their number between one and two charging stations, while assuming a total of 250 EVs, which doubles to 500 in subsequent analyses. The study explores the impact of EV stations placement in DG-integrated distribution networks on power losses, voltage stability, and fault current levels, suggesting a trade-off in allocation strategies. The results underscore the critical challenges posed by the widespread adoption of EVs, particularly in terms of increased power losses and fault current levels. While the number of charging stations has a limited effect, the total number of EVs and their load characteristics are the primary factors affecting system stability.

AB  - This study underscores the critical importance of assessing the performance of the Upper Ganga Canal (UGC) and its minors, Harchandpur and Naserpur. The UGC serves as a lifeline, providing water for both agricultural and non-agricultural purposes in the region, making it vital for food security, rural economies, and environmental sustainability. The uniqueness of this study lies in its comprehensive evaluation of the efficiency of UGC using a multifaceted approach, encompassing meteorological data, field observations and remote sensing. The monetary aspects of the irrigation system performance, which were often ignored in previous studies, have also been included in this study. The study, conducted from 2012 to 2018, assesses various performance indicators. The findings reveal that the capacity of UGC to meet peak irrigation requirements highlights the potential for increased crop production. However, it also demonstrates a concerning decreasing trend in the availability of water, driven by rising non-agricultural water demands. Several performance indicators, such as relative irrigation supply (RIS), relative water supply (RWS), depleted fraction (DF), and crop water deficit (CWD), expose inefficiencies in the system, especially during the sugarcane growth period. Despite supplying ample water, sugarcane exhibits a water deficit, possibly due to the annual maintenance closure of the UGC. This calls for a revision of irrigation scheduling to address changing agricultural practices. Future research can expand this work to include climate change impact assessment, economic analyses, advanced technologies, and socio-economic factors. In summary, this study provides critical insights into the performance of UGC, highlighting the need for modernization and equitable water distribution to meet evolving agricultural demands while addressing the challenges of decreasing water availability and the changing climate.

AB  - The development of new methods to utilize solar energy is critical to lower greenhouse gas emissions and provide sustainable livelihoods for small business owners in rural areas. Solar greenhouse dryers are simple and low-cost structures that can be modified for a variety of applications. This study evaluated the performance of a solar greenhouse dryer for drying water hyacinth. The solar dryer was established in Nakhon Pathom, Thailand and consisted of a parabolic roof structure covered with polycarbonate sheets. A ventilation system was designed using fans controlled by relative humidity sensors and powered by a solar panel. The drying system had an overall efficiency of 63% for 100 kg of fresh water hyacinth with a highest temperature of 59 degrees C. In comparison with natural sun drying, the solar dryer produced more product in a shorter amount of time. In addition to regulating the climatic conditions, this solar greenhouse prevented insect infestation, and improved the product quality. The payback period was estimated to be about 1.5 months. This study can be used as a guideline to produce dried water hyacinth for cushioning material, or other products. Also, this solar dryer offers a promising solution for effective drying of other agricultural or food products.

AB  - From 2000 to 2019, trade between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Peru grew at an average annual rate of 22%, however, income and wealth inequality in Peru remained the same. The aim of this study is to understand the effect of trade between Peru and China on the inclusive economic growth of Peru from 2000 to 2019. The method used was the correlation of variables, and a linear regression between Peru and China trade and several indicators of inclusive economic growth in the Peruvian economy was performed using the Ordinary Least Squares model. The results suggest that there is sufficient statistical evidence to support that inclusive economic growth may depend on increased trade between Peru and China; the study show that if trade growth between Peru and China fluctuates by $1 million per year, labor income will increase by $10.3 per capita in the Economically Active Population (EAP). Moreover, for every 1% increase in trade between Peru and China, GDP per capita increases by 0.1057% and labor productivity increases by 0.0681740%. The variables poverty, vulnerable employment, GINI index and life expectancy at birth were not significant factors.(c) 2022 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.

AB  - The Kyoto Protocol compares greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) using the global warming potential (GWP) with a 100 yr time-horizon. The GWP was developed, however, to illustrate the difficulties in comparing GHGs. In response, there have been many critiques of the GWP and several alternative emission metrics have been proposed. To date, there has been little focus on understanding the linkages between, and interpretations of, different emission metrics. We use an energy balance model to mathematically link the absolute GWP, absolute global temperature change potential (AGTP), absolute ocean heat perturbation (AOHP), and integrated AGTP. For pulse emissions, energy conservation requires that AOHP D AGWP - iAGTP/lambda and hence AGWP and iAGTP are closely linked and converge as AOHP decays to zero. When normalizing the metrics with CO2 (GWP, GTP, and iGTP), we find that the iGTP and GWP are similar numerically for a wide range of GHGs and time-horizons, except for very short-lived species. The similarity between the iGTP(X) and GWP(X) depends on how well a pulse emission of CO2 can substitute for a pulse emission of X across a range of time-horizons. The ultimate choice of emission metric(s) and time-horizon(s) depends on policy objectives. To the extent that limiting integrated temperature change over a specific time-horizon is consistent with the broader objectives of climate policy, our analysis suggests that the GWP represents a relatively robust, transparent and policy-relevant emission metric.

AB  - Signatory countries to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its supplementary Kyoto Protocol (KP) are obliged to report greenhouse gas emissions and removals. Changes in the carbon stock of living biomass should be reported using either the default or stock change methods of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) under the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry sector. Traditionally, volume estimates are used as a forestry measures. Changes in living biomass may be assessed by first estimating the change in the volume of stem wood and then converting this volume to whole tree biomass using biomass expansion factors (BEFs). However, this conversion is often non-trivial because the proportion of stem wood increases with tree size at the expense of branches, foliage, stump and roots. Therefore, BEFs typically vary over time and their use may result in biased estimates. The objective of this study was to evaluate differences between biomass estimates obtained using biomass equations and BEFs with particular focus on uncertainty analysis. Assuming that the development of tree fractions in different ways can be handled by individual biomass equations, BEFs for standing stock were shown to overestimate the biomass sink capacity (Sweden). Although estimates for BEFs derived for changes in stock were found to be unbiased, the estimated BEFs varied substantially over time (0.85-1.22 ton CO2/m(3)). However, to some extent this variation may be due to random sampling errors rather than actual changes. The highest accuracy was obtained for estimates based on biomass equations for different tree fractions, applied to data from the Swedish National Forest Inventory using a permanent sample design (estimated change in stock 1990-2005: 420 million tons CO2, with a standard error amounting to 26.7 million tons CO2) Many countries have adopted such a design combined with the stock change method for reporting carbon stock changes under the UNFCCC/KP.

AB  - Metal-organic framework (MOF)-based "nanopesticides" with pH-responsive performance have attracted increasing attention for application in sustainable agriculture. However, little attention has been paid to the impact of nanocarriers on the translocation of nanopesticides in plants. Herein, copper-doped ZIF-8 bimetallic MOF nanoparticles (Cu@ZIF-8) were prepared as nanocarriers by in situ fabrication of ZIF-8. Fludioxonil-loaded Cu@ZIF-8 (Flu@Cu@ZIF-8) could be constructed, and the loading content was 23.9%. The average particle size of Flu@Cu@ZIF-8 was & SIM;80 nm. Flu@Cu@ZIF-8 exhibited acid-responsive release, with cumulative release of 79.5%, 69.9%, and 43.0% at pH values of 5, 7, and 9, respectively, after 48 h. Compared with free fludioxonil, Flu@Cu@ZIF-8 had similar percent inhibition against Fusarium graminearum, and the acute toxicity of fludioxonil against zebrafish could be reduced by up to 68% for Flu@Cu@ZIF-8 after 96 h of exposure. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that FITC-labeled Cu@ZIF-8 could be transported to all parts of a wheat plant from its roots. Flu@Cu@ZIF-8 exhibited stronger uptake and translocation in wheat plants, with a translocation factor 23-41% higher than that of fludioxonil alone. Overall, this work provides insights into the use of stimuli-responsive metal-doped MOF nanocarriers as pesticide-delivery systems in sustainable agriculture.

AB  - Building upon prior research, this study examines the effects of European Union (EU) accession on suicide rates in the Eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007 using pooled cross-sectional time-series data that cover approximately 20years (1990-2011). Results from fixed-effects regression analyses indicate that EU entry has no effect on total suicide rates and suicide rates among males, but has a negative effect on female suicide rates in the fully specified models. In addition, we find that EU entry also has a negative effect on the ratio of suicide rates to an aggregated indicator of lethal violence (homicide rates+suicide rates, or the suicide-homicide ratio) for the total population and for the female population. Consistent with previous research, we find some significant negative effects on suicide rates for economic growth and life expectancy at birth, and a positive effect for females. When interpreted with reference to the stream analogy' for understanding the two major forms of lethal violence (suicide and homicide), our findings suggest that the impact of any increase in the flow' of lethal violence associated with EU entry is likely to be manifested in an outward' rather than inward' direction for the nations in the sample. Our analyses also reaffirm previous research documenting appreciable gender differences in lethal violence.

AB  - Over the last several decades, China has taken multiple measures for afforestation and natural forest protection, including setting the goal of carbon neutrality by the middle of 21th century. In order to support the practice of relevant policies from the scientific perspective, it is essential to precisely estimate the carbon storage of arbor forest, as it plays an important role in the carbon cycle of ecosystems. In this study, we first used the latest four phases of national forest inventory data to investigate the variation of carbon storage for both natural and planted arbor forest in China during the covered period (1999-2018). Then we used machine leaning methods to simulate the carbon density based on various kinds of environmental factors and analyzed the contribution of each influencing factor. Our results demonstrate that the total carbon storage for arbor forest in China kept increasing over the last two decades, but this increment was mainly brought about by the continuous expansion of forest land. The gap of carbon sequestration between natural forest and planted forest showed a significant trend of reduction. Additionally, tree age was identified as the dominant factor for influencing the spatiotemporal variation of carbon density among all the independent variables while the impact of climatic factor was limited. Therefore, the future improvement of carbon sequestration of arbor forest in should mainly rely on additional projects of afforestation, reforestation, green space conservation and reduction of emissions in China. Conclusions of this study have important implications for policy makers and other stakeholders to evaluate the previous achievement of environmental projects and can also help to set future plans and finally realize the goals of carbon neutrality.

AB  - Main conclusionThis review highlights the molecular, biochemical and physiological responses of plants under soil compaction and presents suitable strategies for optimizing soil compaction for sustainable and intelligent plant production.AbstractSoil compaction (SC) increases the mechanical impedance of agricultural crops, which restricts plant growth, root elongation, and productivity. Therefore, exploring the impacts of SC-induced alterations in plants and developing optimization strategies are crucial for sustainable agricultural production and ensuring global food security. However, the regulation of molecular, biochemical and physiological responses to SC in plants has not yet been well explored. Here, we conducted a thorough analysis of the relevant literature regarding the primary factors behind SC in agricultural soils, mechanistic insights into SC-mediated molecular and physiological alterations in plants, the impact of SC on plant productivity, and SC-minimization strategies for eco-friendly and intelligent agricultural production. The existing information suggests that plant roots sense SC-induced changes in soil properties, including decreased soil water content, hypoxia, nutrient deficiency and mechanical stimuli, through altering the expression of membrane-located ion channel- or stimulus receptor-related genes, such as MSLs, MCA1, and AHK. After signal transduction, the synthesis and transport of several plant hormones, mainly ABA, ethylene and auxin, change and restrict root deepening but promote root thickening. In addition, the changes in plant hormones in combination with decreased water availability and decreased root hydraulic conductance induced by SC affect aboveground physiological responses, such as decreasing leaf hydraulic conductance, promoting stomatal closure and inhibiting plant photosynthesis. Comprehensive physiological insights into SC in plants and SC optimization strategies could be useful to soil biologists and plant eco-physiologists seeking to improve soil management and sustainable agricultural plant production to promote global food security.

AB  - Gas extraction is an important method to solve coal mine gas disasters, utilize coalbed methane (CBM) resources and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Construction of underground extraction boreholes in coal seams is a widely used method for pre-extraction gas in active coal mines in many countries. In most mines, the methane concentration is low and the methane flow decay rate is fast during the extraction process. One of the important reasons is the poor performance of borehole plugging and serious air leakage. Many plugging methods are applied to gas extraction boreholes, but a systematic comparison of the methods has not been conducted. This review analyzes reasons for the poor plugging performance of gas extraction boreholes through reviewing the main plugging methods of gas extraction in active mines. We find that the development range of fractures around a borehole needs to be studied comprehensively and the initial plugging depth and the length of a borehole need to be determined based on theoretical analysis. The grouting pressure cannot meet engineering requirements and plugging materials such as polyurethane and cement cannot effectively plug fractures around a borehole. This review also proposes strategies for improving the plugging performance. Firstly, time-dependent characteristics of the development of fractures around extraction boreholes under multiple damage conditions can be studied. Moreover, new plugging materials can be developed and plugging performances of materials can be tested. Lastly, reasonable plugging length and grouting pressure can be determined. This review can guide the design and optimization of plugging methods to enhance gas extraction efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

AB  - Unprecedented increases in agricultural nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in recent years have caused substantial environmental pollution that leads to ozone depletion and global warming. Application of biochar and/or nitrification inhibitors (NIs) has the potential to reduce N2O emissions; however, it is not clear how biochar application may affect the efficacy of NI in reducing nitrification rates, soil enzyme activities, and N2O emissions under different soil moisture regimes. We conducted a 60-day laboratory incubation experiment to study the effects of manure biochar and nitrapyrin (as a NI) on N2O emissions from a urea fertilized soil with either 60 (low) or 80% (high) water-filled pore space (WFPS). Nitrification rates were significantly affected by biochar x NI x WFPS and biochar x WFPS interactions. Biochar initially increased and then decreased the rates, resulting in 45.2 and 26.6% (P < 0.001 for both) overall reductions in low and high WFPS, respectively while NI reduced the rates only in the first 10 days at 60% WFPS. Biochar decreased (P < 0.001) and NI increased (P = 0.007) beta-1,4-N-acetyl glucosaminidase activities while urease activities were increased (P < 0.001) by biochar across WFPS. Biochar had significant interaction with NI in cumulative N2O emissions with the efficacy of NI being reduced when co-applied with biochar. Cumulative N2O emissions were greater at high than at low WFPS; the emissions were decreased by biochar at 60% WFPS and NI at both 60 and 80% WFPS. We conclude that biochar reduces efficacy of nitrapyrin in mitigating N2O emissions and their effects on net nitrification rates, enzyme activities and N2O emissions are dependent on soil moisture level.

AB  - Today, sustainability in higher education is a key factor for our society, and women play a fundamental role. However, gender faces a series of inequalities in this field of action, and from this point of view, university education is not left out. It is necessary to incorporate strategies and initiatives to reduce these inequalities within the classroom, supported mainly through public policies, which represents a challenge. It is a practical and essential challenge for public and private universities to ensure that their students are prepared for a globalized, sustainable, and gender-sensitive world. In the 2030 Agenda, two Sustainable Development Goals are proposed to address these issues, targeting SDG 5 gender equality and SDG 4 inclusive education. This study considers that to address this issue, it is necessary to identify initiatives that aim to propose measures for sustainable education and reduce the gender gap, to know which and what types of policies or strategies aim to address these issues in higher education in the same way of identifying good practices focused on inclusive policies, models, and teaching styles, also considering scientific research for sustainable education. This study considers the review of policies to reduce gaps in the STEM areas of university education and whether these measures address the goal of sustainable development. As main findings and conclusions, this study highlights the initiatives and good practices found in the literature review since 2007 but concentrated during the last five years. In addition to the literature review, this bibliographic review is complemented by presenting a practical case study with real data from a public, state, and regional university in the south of the country of Chile that takes on this challenge and shares it. The PRISMA protocol guided this study, finding 341 relevant articles to be analyzed, which mainly show how it is possible to implement measures and improve sustainable education with a gender focus through policies and initiatives within a university in the short term.

AB  - Biofuels have received legislative support recently in California's Low-Carbon Fuel Standard and the Federal Energy Independence and Security Act. Both present new fuel types, but neither provides methodological guidelines for dealing with the inherent uncertainty in evaluating their potential lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions reductions are based on point estimates only. This work demonstrates the use of Monte Carlo simulation to estimate life-cycle emissions distributions from ethanol and butanol from corn or switchgrass. Life-cycle emissions distributions for each feedstock and fuel pairing modeled span an order of magnitude or more. Using a streamlined life-cycle assessment, corn ethanol emissions range from 50 to 250 g CO(2)e/MJ, for example, and each feedstock-fuel pathway studied shows some probability of greater emissions than a distribution for gasoline. Potential GHG emissions reductions from displacing fossil fuels with biofuels are difficult to forecast given this high degree of uncertainty in life-cycle emissions. This uncertainty is driven by the importance and uncertainty of indirect land use change emissions. Incorporating uncertainty in the decision making process can illuminate the risks of policy failure (e.g., increased emissions), and a calculated risk of failure due to uncertainty can be used to inform more appropriate reduction targets in future biofuel policies.

AB  - Polyurethanes (PUs) are multipurpose polymers that are increasingly used in many industrial fields. The main compounds used to synthesize PUs are still derived from petrochemicals. The last decade has witnessed an upsurge of research and technological innovations in developing PUs, especially the polyol component from bio-based resources. These efforts are primarily driven by uncertainty surrounding the crude oil reserves and environmental pollution. Among the bio-derived resources, seed oils are the most promising and intensely investigated raw materials in the PU industry due to their abundance, inherent biodegradability, and low price. There are numerous strategies to chemically functionalize the structure of seed oils by introducing hydroxyl groups and convert them into reactive polyols for PU synthesis. The seed oil-based polyols with different structures and functions enable synthesis of industrial PUs with mechanical and thermal characteristics comparable to those of petrochemical-based PUs. Herein we systematically review the literature on synthesis of PUs using polyols derived from seed oils with special focus on their mechanical performance and thermal properties. Given the potential of seed oil-based PUs in many industrial applications, we expect that they will attract increasing commercial interest and scientific research to bring these materials to the market in the near future.

AB  - The building sector is one of the key consumers of energy worldwide. Thus, the retrofitting of existing buildings provides excellent opportunities for reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This paper presents a critical review of the research undertaken on housing retrofits and discusses the approaches driving the assessment of energy-efficiency measures. It is clear from the existing literature that many retrofitting strategies are quite similar in their approaches, the most common of these being passive strategies such as insulation of the envelope, replacement of windows, and air sealing. However, the assessment methodologies differ broadly and widely, which restricts a comparison of the results across various studies. This current state of the art review highlights the need to apply a life cycle approach in order to find the optimal retrofitting solutions, and to identify the real improvement potential of housing renovation. Life cycle assessment and life cycle cost methodologies have been analyzed by discussing the existing limitations, which can be mitigated by sensitivity analysis. Finally, whilst social impacts were addressed in a few studies, life cycle social assessment was not conducted in any of the papers reviewed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bioenergy production is a new and promising industry in Ecuador. However, a confusing variety of laws, which are spread among different regulating institutions, regulate the agricultural sector. Such dispersion makes it difficult for farmers and businesses to understand applicable rights, duties, regulations and agricultural policies. Moreover, this rather young industry lacks important experience. In the first section of this work, the existing Ecuadorian legislation on bioenergy is presented and analyzed. Then, a brief, thorough analysis and comparison are carried out for experiences not only in developed countries, but also with similar cultural frameworks and comparable climatic conditions. The results are summarized as specific recommendations that have been handed to the National Agricultural Chamber of Ecuador from academia for the proposal of a Unified Agricultural Code established in the Ecuadorian legal hierarchy as an Organic Law.

AB  - The establishment of environmental barriers against the spread of disease is an important factor contributing to changes in the age composition of a population. Although the net result of the numerous forces working upon the population has been to increase the life span, a corollary effect has been to expose the individual longer to conditions which influence his function and development. This result produces health problems associated with an aging population. The objectives in environmental health are to establish physical barriers to prevent the spread of disease, and to provide surroundings that will help maintain vital resistance and promote positive health and a sense of well-being. The engineer directs his attention not to people but to the physical environment in which they live. He is equipped to prevent but not to cure. Environmental health measures must either await accumulation of essential knowledge, or be directed at raising the standard of living so as to benefit the public health. Some aspects of environmental health, as it relates to health problems associated with the aging population, are environmental cancer, heart disease, mental health, housing, accidents, atmospheric pollution, care of the chronically ill. The immediate problem of the engineer seems to be that of gathering and analyzing data concerning relationships between environment and the health of older people. There remain many unsolved problems, especially in radiological health and the hygiene of housing. Health agencies must promote widespread application of existing sanitation knowledge in a national effort to prevent preventable diseases.

AB  - Private and public governance instruments seeking to ensure sustainability in agro-food value chains have become ubiquitous in the past three decades. Virtually all major retailers, agro-food processors and international commodity traders have been involved in one or another sustainability initiative or multistakeholder engagement. An emerging critical literature shows that achieving sustainability goals along value chains often comes at the cost of profitability at the production level. While some hope has been placed on South-driven sustainability standards to better reflect local needs and contexts, their record in doing so has been mixed. In this article, we examine how different kinds of sustainability governance affect inequality within and along the South African wine value chain. We show that sustainability governance is not paying off for many grape growers and wine producers in South Africa, nor is it supporting entry and ownership of historically disadvantaged persons (HDPs) - despite the government's stated transformation objectives. We conclude that sustainability governance is abetting existing inequalities and question the ability of current initiatives to shape more just, equitable and environmentally-friendly value chains. We also argue that any future discussion of sustainability and its governance in global value chains should also be a discussion of inequality.

For Serengeti wildebeest an empirical relationship between dry season adult mortality rate, density and food supply was found. This relationship predicted that: the population would stabilize between 1.0 and 1.5 million animals, dry season mortality would be density dependent and sufficient to account for the leveling off of this large ungulate population. Recent observations have tested and confirmed these predictions.

AB  - Soil macroaggregates are crucial for carbon sequestration, water retention, and soil fertility. Their ecological functions are influenced by their pore characteristics. Yet, the relationship between pore structure and the movement of water and carbon within macroaggregates is not fully understood. In this study, the porosity, connectivity, and morphology of macroaggregate pores in three typical soil types in China were characterized. Additionally, water permeability and carbon sequestration were modeled based on in-situ CT-scanning images. The results indicated that the macropores within the macroaggregates serve as the primary channels for water permeability, while pore morphology of mesopores significantly influences carbon sequestration. The water permeability increased with the presence of macropores and enhanced connectivity within the macroaggregates. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) showed a pronounced correlation with oblate pores across all samples, and a more intricate structure offered more surface area space, trapping additional carbon particles. The established model not only elucidates how various pore structures influence the transport of carbon particles and carbon sequestration but also simulates the structural changes in macroaggregates throughout the process. This allows for an intuitive understanding of water and carbon distribution and migration. This research presents an innovative simulation of water and carbon distribution within macroaggregates using micron-scale CT data.

AB  - In recent studies, various reports reveal that stubble burning of crop residues in India generates nearly 150 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2), more than 9 million tons of carbon monoxide (CO), a quarter-million tons of sulphur oxides (SOX), 1 million tons of particulate matter and more than half a million tons of black carbon. These contribute directly to environmental pollution, as well as the haze in the Indian capital, New Delhi, and the diminishing glaciers of the Himalayas. Although stubble burning crop residue is a crime under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Air and Pollution Control Act (APCA) of 1981, a lack of implementation of these government acts has been witnessed across the country. Instead of burning, crop residues can be utilized in various alternative ways, including use as cattle feed, compost with manure, rural roofing, bioenergy, beverage production, packaging materials, wood, paper, and bioethanol, etc. This review article aims to present the current status of stubble-burning practices for disposal of crop residues in India and discuss several alternative methods for valorization of crop residues. Overall, this review article offers a solid understanding of the negative impacts of mismanagement of the crop residues via stubble burning in India and the other more promising management approaches including use for bioenergy, which, if widely employed, could not only reduce the environmental impacts of crop residue management, but generate additional value for the agricultural sector globally.

AB  - Technological innovations have meant that the way images of the victims of war and other categories of body horror are procured and disseminated has changed. Soldiers in theatre may record what they witness, and upload this material online. Terrorist groups have staged the executions of hostages for the camera and distributed this imagery via the internet. Thus, the circulation of body horror is enabled in ways that evade the prerogatives of the mainstream press to produce news which accords with notions of "taste and decency", using practices which protect publics from imagery which may cause harm yet also often map with a propagandist function to conceal the carnage of war from public view. The essay explores online spectatorship which takes place outside that which is deemed appropriate for the publics of news, arguing that we must move beyond the reductive ways in which looking at body horror has been conceptualized. Neither witnessing, as the posited correct form of spectatorship, nor the pervasive pornographic analogy used to render moral judgment on such looking account for the diversity of spectatorial positions taken up by those who choose to look at online imagery of the dead and suffering.

AB  - Livestock manures significantly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and soil contamination if not valorised or disposed of properly. Meanwhile, hydrothermal liquefaction has emerged as a promising technology for the conversion of wet wastes into value-added products. As such, this study investigates the potential of hydrothermal liquefaction of camel manure and subsequent upgrading into drop-in fuels in Qatar. Experimental characterisation of manure samples is conducted, while a small-scale plant is simulated and evaluated using Aspen Plus (R). Excess treated wastewater of Qatar is utilised as an alter-native to fresh water in the process, while power is completely generated on-site. The demonstrated results are promising; whereby, a biocrude yield of 37.9% (on dry and ash-free basis) is achieved, while the biocrude is upgraded into a high-quality bio-gasoline. The produced bio-gasoline contributes to a 7% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions relative to conventional gasoline. The project capital investment is estimated to be 38 M$, while the bio-gasoline's minimum selling price is at 0.87 $/kg, which is still above the market price of conventional gasoline in Qatar (similar to 0.6 $/kg). However, the conducted sensitivity analysis indicates that scaling-up the plant by 5-fold can shift the fuel's minimum selling price below the average market price. As such, it has a high potential to be locally commercialised especially at times of petroleum price hikes. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Increases in greenhouse gas emissions are expected to cause changes both in climatic variability in the Pacific linked to El Ntho Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and in long-term average climate. While mean state and variability changes have been studied separately, much less is known about their combined impact or relative importance. Additionally, studies of projected changes in ENSO have tended to focus on changes in, or adjacent to, the Pacific. Here we examine projected changes in climatic conditions during El Nino years and in ENSO-driven precipitation variability in 36 CMIP5 models. The models are forced according to the RCP8.5 scenario in which there are large, unmitigated increases in greenhouse gas concentrations during the twenty-first century. We examine changes over much of the globe, including 25 widely spread regions defined in the IPCC special report Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX). We confirm that precipitation variability associated with ENSO is projected to increase in the tropical Pacific, consistent with earlier research. We also find that the enhanced tropical Pacific variability drives ENSO-related variability increases in 19 SREX regions during DJF and in 18 during JJA. This externally forced increase in ENSO-driven precipitation variability around the world is on the order of 15%-20%. An increase of this size, although substantial, is easily masked at the regional level by internally generated multidecadal variability in individual runs. The projected changes in El Ntho driven precipitation variability are typically much smaller than projected changes in both mean state and ENSO neutral conditions in nearly all regions.

AB  - Timely and granular information on urban and economic growth is necessary for achieving sustainable development goals. This study aims to predict economic growth and urban land-use change in one of the fastest-growing cities in Thailand-Ban Chang District-from 2021 to 2030. Geospatial and economic data obtained from Google Earth Engine and government agencies were utilized to meet the objective. This paper presents a newly developed modeling framework that integrates CLUE-S with a structural equation model to predict economic growth and urban land-use change at the district level. The obtained results show that the average spatial accuracy of the model is 92%. Under normal circumstances, the results suggest urban land expansion to take place in the central, western, and southern parts of Ban Chang District. In addition to urban land growth, the compound annual growth rate of Ban Chang's GDP between 2021 and 2030 is 5.6%. Operating based on open data and open-source software packages, the modeling framework developed in this study can be applied to other developing countries for timely monitoring the economic growth at the city or district level.

AB  - Vineyards can be valuable habitats for biodiversity conservation. For example, in Rhineland-Palatinate (Germany) over a third of the state's critically endangered Woodlark (Lullula arborea) population breeds in vineyards along the western margin of the Upper Rhine Valley. We here aim to elucidate how local ground cover management, food availability and the proximity to settlements affect territory selection by this bird species in the region. As climate, site conditions and management differ greatly from more continental or Mediterranean wine-growing areas, conditions for Woodlark conservation may differ as well. We compared 26 Woodlark territories in vineyards with 26 nearby reference areas from which Woodlarks were absent. We recorded vineyard ground cover in the inter-rows (% cover) as well as vegetation height and composition (forbs vs. grasses). Arthropods were sampled using pitfall traps, since they are the main food resource of Woodlarks during the breeding season. In addition, the distance to built-up areas was measured. The vegetation in Woodlark territories was shorter (mean 14.2 vs. 19.6 cm) and more dominated by forbs (39% vs. 27% cover) than in absence areas. The vegetation cover in the inter-rows had no effect on Woodlark territory presence or absence. Woodlarks also favoured areas with a higher abundance of arthropods (mean abundance 69.1 vs. 57.5) and a greater distance to built-up areas (mean distance 554 vs. 373 m). We conclude that to promote the Woodlark in wine-growing areas, short, forb-rich swards should be created, facilitating arthropod detectability. This is likely to require low levels of nitrogen fertilization since fertilizers favour tall-growing grasses that outcompete forbs. Pesticide applications should be kept at a minimum to enhance arthropods as the main food source for Woodlarks and their chicks. In addition, the expansion of settlements into breeding areas of Woodlarks should be avoided.

AB  - Meeting the challenges of sustainable development and regeneration to support city growth requires the provision of attributed 3D geological and geotechnical data, information and process understanding in the urban subsurface. This provides a 3D framework for the characterisation of the spatial variability of the properties and processes within the shallow subsurface to aid sustainable land use planning and regeneration. The subsurface has to provide the resources and ecosystem services to sustain and create economic growth and meet societal needs, now and in the future while minimising the environmental impact of development. The 3D variability of the ground results from anthropogenic (man-made) processes as well as geological. Human exploitation of the subsurface and rapid land use change in response to population growth and urbanisation, result in temporal and spatial modification of the ground. The integration of 3D geological and anthropogenic deposits models is therefore essential for the characterisation of urban "zone of human interaction" and its response to anthropogenic environmental change. Model integration to aid land use planning has been applied in the formerly heavily industrialised cities of NW England and Northern Ireland to provide a basis for linear transport assessment, urban planning and the assessment of aquifer vulnerability.

AB  - As the world's second largest producer of natural gas, Iran relies heavily on natural gas for 70% of its energy needs. There are, however, challenges associated with energy supply in remote regions attached to the gas pipeline network, particularly during the cold season when fuel oil is required for heating and energy provisioning. To address this issue, this research proposes the use of alternative energy sources, such as hydrogen, for non-residential energy consumption, including agriculture and livestock. A key objective of this study is to develop an optimization model for the generation of electricity from hydrogen resources, as well as formulate a robust strategy to assist electricity producers in maximizing their profits. Using this model, producers are able to set prices in accordance with their risk tolerance and present them to the market, thus mitigating price fluctuations. In the targeted sectors, the results indicate that appropriate pricing models can prevent rebound effects. Specifically, the implementation of this model can reduce natural gas consumption by up to 20% and fuel oil usage by 15% during peak seasons. Additionally, the optimal pricing strategy can lead to a 10% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The results of this research provide stable and reliable solutions to the energy supply challenges in these regions, thus making the energy market more resilient and environmentally friendly.

AB  - This paper considers the relationship between gender and private pension provision. It provides a brief history of private pensions before considering the implications of pension policy on women's private pension situation under New Labour and, briefly, the coalition government. For instance, there has been an emphasis on neoliberal concerns of private saving and individual responsibility as a means of reducing expenditure and encouraging long-term sustainability. The paper suggests that the focus on individual responsibility in pension saving leaves many women ill-equipped to save and dependent on means-tested pension provision, largely as a result of intermittent work histories.

AB  - Assessing the impacts of unprecedented biodiversity loss on planetary resilience, The Economics of Biodiversity: the Dasgupta Review ("Dasgupta Review") asserts that sustainable engagement with nature is crucial for sustaining the livelihoods of present and future generations. It further urges the integration of biodiversity into national accounting and science-based decision-making processes in order to advance the well-being of both people and the planet. Here, we present the salient features of the Dasgupta Review along with several recommendations for strengthening global biodiversity and ecosystem conservation efforts. Although institutional transformations at regional and national scales are essential to facilitate the recognition of economies' dependence on nature, behavioral changes at the level of the individual are also needed to better understand, value, manage, and utilize biodiversity. Formulation of inclusive policies prioritizing biodiversity conservation and sustainable resource consumption is also essential for averting future public health risks associated with ecosystem degradation and species loss.

This study explores the structural and dynamic patterns of biomass-based bioenergy research. We measure the profile of biomass research on both macro scales (nations) and meso level (institutions) in an international context. We find that biomass publications are intensively distributed in developed regions and some emerging economies. The U.S. leads in this emerging field as evidenced by research quantity, impact, and international collaboration links. China is developing rapidly in this domain in terms of publication volume and collaborative links but suffers from low research visibility. The study also finds strong interactions are taking place both within macro-disciplines and between macro-disciplines. Research limitations are presented.

AB  - Soil erosion is a severe threat for ecosystems and anthropogenic infrastructure. Glaciers are retreating rapidly due to global warming and the receding ice leaves unvegetated depositions of sediment, which are prone to mobilisation during precipitation events. Vegetation is known to serve as erosion protection, but how above- and belowground plant traits, vegetation cover and plant diversity on community level are jointly affecting erosion is unclear. Additionally, soil microbial communities may have effects on slope stability by promoting plant growth and function. We measured sediment transport on 30 plots of 2 x 3 m size on proglacial slopes of the Gepatschferner glacier (Kaunertal, Austria) over three years in a natural pristine high alpine environment. Vegetation cover, species abundances and relevant above- and belowground traits were measured for each occurring plant species on community level. Path model analysis revealed that dense and species-rich plant cover characterized by specific plant growth strategies and trait diversity was best suited to decrease erosion. Vegetation properties were also closely linked to the composition of soil microbial communities characterised by next generation amplicon sequencing, which may facilitate soil formation and further enhance the plants' soil stabilising potential. Our study illustrates that erosion control may benefit from a high vegetation cover, which is facilitated by diverse plant communities with complementary morphological traits. These vegetation properties also affect soil microbiota, but their impact on slope protection in combination with the vegetation remains to be elucidated. Our findings may inform nature-based solutions against erosion such as revegetation of alpine slopes using specific seed mixtures. (C) 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Knowledge of differential life-history strategies in arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi is relevant for understanding the ecology of this group and its potential role in sustainable agriculture and carbon sequestration. At present, AM fungal life-history theories often focus on differential investment into intra- vs extraradical structures among AM fungal taxa, and its implications for plant benefits. With this Viewpoint we aim to expand these theories by integrating a mycocentric economics- and resource-based life-history framework. As in plants, AM fungal carbon and nutrient demands are stoichiometrically coupled, though uptake of these elements is spatially decoupled. Consequently, investment in morphological structures for carbon vs nutrient uptake is not in competition. We argue that understanding the ecology and evolution of AM fungal life-history trade-offs requires increased focus on variation among structures foraging for the same element, that is within intra- or extraradical structures (in our view a 'horizontal' axis), not just between them ('vertical' axis). Here, we elaborate on this argument and propose a range of plausible life-history trade-offs that could lead to the evolution of strategies in AM fungi, providing testable hypotheses and creating opportunities to explain AM fungal co-existence, and the context-dependent effects of AM fungi on plant growth and soil carbon dynamics.

AB  - Social work's response to global climate change has dramatically increased over the last several years. Similarly, growing attention has been paid to rural social work; less clear, however, is how social work, responsive to global climate change, is developed, deployed, and understood in rural contexts; this systematic review elaborates on current social work contributions (research, practice, and policymaking), promoting environmental justice and sustainability in rural communities. Utilizing the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) approach, this article thematically analyzed and synthesized 174 journal articles on social work-specific interventions and environmental justice. The results illustrate insights into the experiences, practices, or objectives of rural social workers vis-a-vis climate change. Significant themes from the literature demonstrated that gender, age, and race limited access to social work services and climate-related disaster response support in rural settings; this article argues that rural community-driven social work practices focused on environmental justice and sustainability should be encouraged and that policy advocacy attentive to climate change and its impact on vulnerable and marginalized groups should be pursued. Current and prospective social work scholars, practitioners, policymakers, and other stakeholders should collaborate with local rural communities to address their unique needs related to climate change. In turn, grassroots strategies should be co-developed to promote climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction, ultimately achieving the goal of building resilient, healthy, and sustainable rural communities.

AB  - The Act Belong Commit (R) mental health promotion campaign aims to improve population mental well-being. Based on a social-franchising model, partnerships are sought with organizations offering 'mentally healthy activities' that foster social connectedness and mental well-being. There are four categories of partner organizations sought: Site (government agencies and health services), Associate (organizations with state-wide or national services), Community (local, grass-roots community groups) and Schools. This research explored organizational perceptions of the Act Belong Commit (R) Partnership Program. A purposive sample of 14 organizational representatives across all four partner categories participated in semi-structured interviews online or face-to-face between July and September 2021. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to identify three main themes: (a) A passion for promoting mental health; (b) Implementation, innovation, adaption and creation (e.g. the ability to adapt, create and deliver activities aligned with the campaign message; and (c) Future sustainability (e.g. recommendations for the sustainability of the programme). The use of reflexive thematic analysis enabled deeper insights into the complexity of the partnerships. Findings describe how the Act Belong Commit (R) Partnership Program supports mutually desirable objectives and extends the campaign reach. Embedded in a shared belief system that incorporates a passion for good mental health, the model supports the flexibility to adapt, create and deliver fit-for-purpose activities that promote mental well-being in the places where people live, work and play.

AB  - Determining how much nonindustrial private forest (NIPF) land could potentially be allocated to growing short rotation woody crops (SRWCs) is critical for estimating the future supply of woody biomass for biofuels and overall bioenergy production. This study estimated the proportion of the land NIPF landowners would be willing to allocate to SRWC cultivation. In view of the bounded nature of the dependent binary variable [0,1] and model performance, a fractional logit regression model was used to estimate model parameters. The estimated proportion of land allocated to SRWCs was positively influenced by the rental rate per acre, owning land for investment or fee-access hunting purposes, and the landowner's age. In contrast, size of the ownership, owning land for the production of agricultural products, and residing on the land negatively influenced the proportion of land allocated to SRWCs. Lease contract duration, location of the largest tract owned, owning land for personal recreation or ecosystem services, and landowner familiarity with the concept of alternative fuels production did not influence the proportion of land allocated to SRWCs. These results will contribute to a better understanding of SRWC biomass supply from NIPF land and provide important benchmark information for conducting feasibility analyses of biofuel and biopower manufacturing in Mississippi and other states with abundant woody feedstocks.Study Implications: To achieve targeted levels of bioenergy production and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reductions and diversify NIPF landowner income, participation of NIPF landowners in woody biomass feedstock production will be critical, because they own a majority of forestland in the region. Moreover, they have diverse reasons for owning land which has extensive implications not only in terms of incentive types or monetary compensation levels they might require for cultivating SRWCs but also policies related to the development of the bioenergy sector in Mississippi, the location of individual bioenergy processing facilities, and feedstock types that will be developed. Thus, forest managers and biomass procurement foresters might need to decide whether to focus their efforts on maximizing the land area allocated to growing SRWCs or considering a mix of SRWCs at lower lease rates per acre and material obtained from thinnings, which might be more amenable to landowners who value environmental amenities.

AB  - Increasing municipal solid waste (MSW) has caused severe environmental pollution and social problems, which require effective treatment and resource utilization. Therefore, combined with a sustainable approach, an urban vacuum waste collection (VWC) system was established in this study. To optimize VWC management, a bi-objective model is created to address the issue of waste management in this work in an environmentally friendly way. This model evaluates the economic benefits, social benefits, and environmental costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). The proposed model is solved using the augmented e-constraint method. Numeric results show the efficiency of the mentioned method. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to verify the model. The results depict that the VWC model is sensitive to parameters such as budget, transfer station capacity, treatment facilities' capacity, and infrastructure costs.{GRAPHIACAL ABSTRACT}

AB  - This study investigates decarbonization pathways for the road freight transport sector by evaluating three alternatives to conventional diesel trucks: trucks powered by biofuels, battery electric trucks, and fuel cell trucks with hydrogen. A prospective life cycle assessment of these options is conducted under two policy scenarios for decarbonization across 12 distinct regions over the century. Employing a cradle-to-grave approach, the assessment covers activities from fuel and electricity production to the end-of-life of truck components. Findings reveal that, in eight of the 12 regions examined, an early transition to battery electric trucks could increase life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 70 % by 2030 compared to the continued use of conventional diesel trucks, underscoring the significance of liquid fuels for short to medium-term decarbonization. However, in the long term, as electricity mixes and hydrogen production are decarbonized, battery electric trucks and hydrogen fuel cell trucks emerge as superior alternatives in all regions, emitting, at least, 29 % less greenhouse gases than trucks powered by biofuels, and 45 % less than diesel trucks. The optimal transition from conventional diesel trucks to trucks powered by biofuels and, subsequently, to battery electric trucks and/or hydrogen could avoid 134-204 Gt CO2eq worldwide and prevent a temperature rise of 0.22-0.33 degrees C compared to the diesel-based scenario. This emphasizes the crucial role of appropriate policies for the timely transformation of the road freight transport sector. Despite this, battery and hydrogen trucks can impact human health up to 239-1200 % more than diesel, which is not to be taken lightly.

AB  - Firms need to protect their positioning innovations from copycatting and imitation by competition. However, there is limited insight into factors driving legal protection of positioning innovations. This research utilizes non-traditional trademark (NTT) registrations as indicators of protection of certain types of positioning innovations by firms and investigates the role of firm and industry factors in these registrations. Findings based on secondary data collected over the time period (1984-2015) reveal that firm age and market share play a positive role in NTT registrations. Analysis also shows that industry munificence plays a positive role in NTT registrations, whereas competitive intensity and industry dynamism lower NTT registrations. Together, these findings provide important implications for research and practice that extend beyond technological innovations and add to the innovations literature in marketing.

AB  - In the context of climate change, concern is raising about the negative effects of some pruning waste management practices. On the one hand, burning of pruning residue is seen as controversial regarding its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, chipping the wood and using it as mulch is seen as highly risky regarding pest and disease control. Considering these issues, it is important to try to understand how and why these practices are adopted. In this study, we conducted in-depth interviews and survey questionnaires in the olive-growing region of Sierra Magina (Andalusia) in order to explore (1) which were the pruning waste management practices in place, (2) which had been these practices in the past, and (3) which were the factors influencing the choice of different practices. Since 2010, there has been a shift in pruning waste management practices in this region, from stubble burning to chipping. This change seems to be led by older/retired farmers that have young and non-inherited groves. Moreover, this change is shown not to be necessarily a result of "greening" in agriculture but rather a result of intensification and mechanization. These results are discussed regarding the processes of innovation adoption in the region and the possible unforeseen externalities that derive from this change in pruning waste management practices.

AB  - The increasing health burdens pose great challenge for planners and policy makers to create a more livable city. Recent literature has linked land use to a wide range of illness and death causes in developed nations. It therefore requires evidence-driven and replicable frameworks to inform land use decisions that integrate with health promotion. This paper proposes a theoretical framework for the mechanistic links between neighborhood land use and public health; and then quantifies their associations at district level, using the case of Shenzhen in developing China. Data for 15 health indicators in 2010 are collected at district level; and a set of standardized land use variables (individual land use type, general land use mix, and physical street conditions) are proposed to comprehensively reflect the neighborhood land use characteristics. Spatial regression is employed to analyze the relationships between health outcomes and land use variables. Results show that the land use exploratory variables vary with health indicators, but several key land use determinants are identified: green land abundance, green land morphology, institutional land proximity, industrial land proximity, blue land abundance, street walkability and street connectivity. Structural equation modeling is further applied to examine the possible mediators and it demonstrates that the casual pathways between land use and public health are quite complex. The developed set of standardized land use variables can serve as practical tools to facilitate land use decisions with health considerations. In practice, several complexities at governance levels challenge the efforts to reconnect land use policies and public health promotion. We put forward three useful solutions to enhancing health connection with land use policy across different international settings. This study captures the nuanced health disparities varied with districts and indicators, and therefore produces some more generalized knowledge that ultimately helps develop land use policies aimed at promoting public health at home and abroad.

For this purpose, the paper uses robust difference-GMM estimation and panel granger causality test. We found that gross domestic investment and regulatory quality are the main variables that contribute to these countries' economic growth. While current government consumption reduces economic growth. Also, government expenditure on education and regulatory quality granger cause economic growth in these countries. However, the effect of government expenditure on education on economic growth is not significant. So, to increase their economic growth, this study recommends these countries' governments to encourage gross domestic investment, maintain regulatory quality and reduce their current consumption. This study also concludes that income inequality has no impact on these countries' economic growth for this period.

AB  - Research on environmental policy support utilises different categorisations of policies, for example, differentiating between policies assumed to be perceived as rewarding or punishing. Do citizens' perception of environmental policies also lend itself to this categorisation? Based on an exhaustive sample of active policies in Sweden, this study presents a taxonomy of environmental policy support in Sweden. A fairly representative Swedish sample (N = 2911) rated the acceptability of 44 environmental policies. Exploratory factor analysis indicated that participants' acceptability of policies forms three categories: push policies consisting of regulatory and market-based disincentives, pull policies consisting mainly of market-based incentives, and informational policies, such as ecolabeling. Sociodemographics had small but consistent effects on attitudes towards the three categories, while political ideology had a larger effect across the categories. This study indicates that current academic categorisations may not adequately capture laypeople's perceptions, and discusses the importance of research on driving mechanisms behind the current taxonomy.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this study is to develop a performance measurement system of environmental sustainability in service settings and to empirically examine the relationship between the measured environmental sustainability and operating performance. Design/methodology/approach - This study applies exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to a six-year panel dataset of 984 US hotels to construct a two-factor standardized measure of environmental sustainability. The authors then conduct a stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) to investigate the relationship between the measured environmental sustainability and the operating performance frontier, considering the impact of operating structure. Findings - Customer behavior and operational decisions are two key drivers of environmental sustainability. There is a positive link between environmental sustainability and operating performance. Operating structure has a significant impact on the operating performance. The performance frontier varies across market segment and location characteristics such as degree of urbanization and climate condition. Practical implications - The findings indicate that service providers should actively involve customers, and manage both front-office and back-office operations in environmental sustainability initiatives. Operating structures that favor the alignment of multiple service supply chain partners' interests contribute positively to performance. The managers should be mindful of varying best-in-class performance due to operating unit characteristics such as market segment, and location characteristics. Originality/value - This study is among the first attempts to develop a performance measurement system of environmental sustainability. The resulted standardized measure of environmental sustainability considers both the revenue and cost impacts in service operations. This research is among the first generation of papers that bring the unique characteristics of service operations, particularly service co-production, into sustainability research.

AB  - Because of the increasing challenges raised by climate change, power generation from renewable energy sources is steadily increasing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, especially CO2. However, this has escalated concerns about the instability of the power grid and surplus power generated because of the intermittent power output of renewable energy. To resolve these issues, this study investigates two technical options that integrate a power-to-gas (PtG) process using surplus wind power and the gas turbine combined cycle (GTCC). In the first option, hydrogen produced using a power-to-hydrogen (PtH) process is directly used as fuel for the GTCC. In the second, hydrogen from the PtH process is converted into synthetic natural gas by capturing carbon dioxide from the GTCC exhaust, which is used as fuel for the GTCC. An annual operational analysis of a 420-MW-class GTCC was conducted, which shows that the CO2 emissions of the GTCC-PtH and GTCC-PtM plants could be reduced by 95.5% and 89.7%, respectively, in comparison to a conventional GTCC plant. An economic analysis was performed to evaluate the economic feasibility of the two plants using the projected cost data for the year 2030, which showed that the GTCC-PtH would be a more viable option.

AB  - This paper addresses some issues related to the carbon cycle and its utilization by society. Traditional uses for agriculture, forestry, as a Source of fuel and other products, and for pastoral farming, among others, have recently been supplemented by identifying its potential for mitigating the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Through the Kyoto Protocol, carbon has become a commodity and the CO2-absorbing capability of the vegetation and soils an economically valuable asset. The multi-facetted roles of the C cycle and its sensitivity to human activities present a demand for techniques that permit accurate, timely and affordable characterization of the various components of this cycle, especially on land where most human activities take place. Such techniques must satisfy a range of demands in terms of purpose, clients for the information, and biosphere properties. However, if successful, they offer the potential to support monitoring, reporting, policy setting, and management of terrestrial biospheric resources. The context for these requirements and possibilities is illustrated with reference to the China Carbon Sequestration Project and its findings. Crown Copyright (C) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The flow of ecosystem services between regions as a result of the mismatch of supply and demand has increasingly become a new research focus. Clarifying the spatial regularity of ecosystem service flow is of great significance for realizing regional sustainable development and improving human well-being. This study applied a network model to map the interregional carbon flow based on the supply and demand of carbon sequestration service, and the driving effect of various driving factors was further analyzed. The results showed that the demand for carbon sequestration service on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau increased steadily from 2000 to 2019, resulting in an increasingly significant difference between supply and demand with more than 20 million tons. In the carbon sequestration service flow network, the number of defined deficit nodes increased to 22 in 2010, but decreased to 21 in 2019. The interrupted edges continued to increase to 16, and the network density dropped to 0.022. The carbon sequestration service flow network on the northeastern parts of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau was severely damaged. With the high-quality development of animal husbandry, the impact of grazing intensity on the difference between the supply and demand of carbon sequestration service has been weakened. When urbanization reached a certain level, the driving effects of urbanization and agricultural activities increased significantly. The study provided a reference for the use of network models to analyze ecosystem service flow, and provided a theoretical basis and data support for local ecological management decisions.

AB  - Importance: Reducing the carbon footprint of the healthcare sector can be achieved along with quality patient outcomes at lower environmental impact. Objective: For the first time to categorize peer-reviewed articles that report quantitative improvement in greenhouse gas emissions related to medical devices and services, overview of trends, and identify some gaps for future research. Data sources: Database searches resulted in 822 peer-reviewed articles (January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2016) on healthcare and environmental sustainability. Study selection: A systematic review methodology identifies, critically evaluates, and integrates the findings. Articles reviewed 1) provided quantitative global warming potential (GWP) information, 2) were published in peer-reviewed journals, and 3) were related to one of the twelve hospital service categories. Results: Patient care teams are substantially limited by a lack of data related to the environmental impact of their services. Of the one of three potential environmental scopes-travel-related energy, direct energy, and the procured goods and equipment embodied energy-only six articles covered all three scopes. Conclusions and relevance: This research provides healthcare nurses, physicians, and administrators with the location of procedures, patient-based decisions, and other avenues to hospital sustainability improvements in twelve hospital service categories.

AB  - Despite much valuable research on the mechanisms for spatio-tempo-ral changesof net primary vegetation productivity (NPP) and net eco-system productivity (NEP), there is a paucity of information on assess-ing impacts of regional multiple factors on spatiotemporal researchs of NPP and NEP in the complex environment. This study attempts to bridge this information gap using the Jianghuai Basin in China as a case study. Using a field campaign, remotely sensed imagery, socioeco-nomic data, and meteorological parameters, we developed a frame -work based on the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model, correlation technique, trend analysis, and landscape metrics to mea-sure spatiotemporal changes in NPP and NEP from 2001 to 2018. The derived changes were then linked to regional multiple factors including climate, landscape factors, human activity, and land use change. The results of the research can provide a scientific basis for vegetation evaluation, ecosystem assessment, and other aspects of the region.

AB  - Recently, dramatic flood disasters have occurred incrementally in several regions of the world. Land-use change as one of the main affecting factors becomes a key component in flood risk management. This study strives to deal with quantifying how changes in land use to affect the dynamic evolution of flood vulnerability. The floodplains of Wuhan, which are located in the Yangtze River Basin, have been selected as an example. In this paper, we use GIS to gather different historical geometric data as sources of land-use information. By proposing the Simpsons-dominance index and location index to analyze the characteristics of land-use changes, and building a quantitative model to measure flood vulnerability, a series of flood vulnerability maps demonstrate differential flood vulnerability of floodplains of Wuhan in three inundation scenarios and four historical periods. Finally, the non-parametric correlation is used to reveal the interactive effect of land use and flood vulnerability. Based on this study, comprehensive flood disaster management strategies for land-use planning are proposed for government decision-makers to reduce the flood vulnerability of Wuhan in future.

AB  - Auto-correlated laser-induced incandescence (AC-LII) infers the soot volume fraction (SVF) of soot particles by comparing the spectral incandescence from laser-energized particles to the pyrometrically inferred peak soot temperature. This calculation requires detailed knowledge of model parameters such as the absorption function of soot, which may vary with combustion chemistry, soot age, and the internal structure of the soot. This work presents a Bayesian methodology to quantify such uncertainties. This technique treats the additional "nuisance" model parameters, including the soot absorption function, as stochastic variables and incorporates the current state of knowledge of these parameters into the inference process through maximum entropy priors. While standard AC-LII analysis provides a point estimate of the SVF, Bayesian techniques infer the posterior probability density, which will allow scientists and engineers to better assess the reliability of AC-LII inferred SVFs in the context of environmental regulations and competing diagnostics.

AB  - The occurrence of microplastics (MPs) in farmlands poses a threat to soil health and crop yield. There needs to be more research on the role of cropping patterns in the accumulation of MPs and quantizing the threat of MPs on soil health and crop yield. In this study, a field study was carried out to explore the role of cropping patterns in the accumulation of MPs in agricultural soil in Shanghai, China. Furthermore, the specific effect and importance of MPs and each soil physicochemical indicator to soil health and crop yield were clarified, and the threat of MPs in reducing soil health and crop yield was quantized. Relative lower MPs abundance was detected in Shanghai. MPs abundance in vegetable fields was significantly higher than that in orchards. The broad source of MPs, the acceleration of plastics breaking under artificial disturbance and warmer temperatures, and the block of MPs exchange could account for the quicker accumulation of MPs in vegetable fields. MPs have a negligible effect on microbial diversity and metabolic activity which plays a role in soil enzyme activity. Besides, MPs served as one of the critical factors for rice yield reduction.

AB  - Technological innovations in warehouse automation systems, such as Autonomous Vehicle based Storage and Retrieval System (AVS/RS), are geared towards achieving greater operational efficiency and flexibility that would be necessary in warehouses of the future. AVS/RS relies on autonomous vehicles and lifts for horizontal and vertical transfer of unit-loads respectively. To implement a new technology such as AVS/RS, the choice of a design variable setting, interactions among the design variables, and the design trade-offs need to be well understood. In particular, design decisions such as the choice of vehicle dwell-point and location of cross-aisles could significantly affect the performance of an AVS/RS. Hence, we investigate the effect of these design decisions using customized analytical models based on multi-class semi-open queuing network theory. Numerical studies suggest that the average percentage reduction in storage and retrieval transactions with appropriate choice of dwell-point is about 8 percent and 4 percent respectively. While end of aisle location of the cross-aisle is commonly used in practice, our model suggests that there exists a better cross-aisle location within a tier (about 15 percent from end of aisle); however, the cycle time benefits by choosing the optimal cross-aisle location in comparison to the end of aisle cross-aisle location is marginal. Detailed simulations also indicate that the analytical model yields fairly accurate results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Delays and community traffic problems associated with US-Mexican border ports of entry have been criticized for causing economic losses and increasing social stressors. This paper draws attention to an overlooked issue, the potential for adverse health effects associated with being exposed to localized high levels of traffic pollutants on border crossers and nearby communities at ports of entry along the US-Mexican border. The literature on health effects of exposure to near-road traffic pollution is incorporated into an analysis of the situation along the USMexican border. This paper synthesizes the information available regarding excessive wait times at the border and describes preliminary studies linking these delays to elevated traffic pollution levels. We frame exposure to traffic pollutants at US-Mexican ports of entry as an environmental justice issue in that the burden of exposures and associated risks of health effects is borne by nearby low income minority communities. Mitigation strategies are explored and reduction of border crossing wait times is identified as the most feasible action. Adverse effects of exposure to near traffic pollution are likely applicable to congested borders throughout the world.

AB  - Air pollution is a major public health threat that is associated with asthma, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and all-cause mortality. Among the most important acute air pollution events occurring each year are celebrations involving fireworks, such as the 4th of July holiday in the United States. In this community-engaged study, academic partners and residents collaborated to collect indoor and outdoor PM2.5 concentration measurements in the disadvantaged city of Santa Ana, California, using low-cost AtmoTube sensor devices before, during and after the July 4th firework celebration, while also examining July 4th data extracted from the PurpleAir sensor network across over a hundred other cities in southern California. Average outdoor PM2.5 concentrations on July 4th were found to be three-to-five times higher than baseline, with hourly concentrations exceeding 160 mu g/m(3). Outdoor averages were roughly 30% to 100% higher than indoor levels. The most polluted cities exhibited 15-times higher PM2.5 levels compared with the least contaminated cities and were often those where household-level fireworks were legal for sale and use. Race/ethnicity was found to be the leading predictor of July 4th-related air pollution across three counties in southern California, with greater PM2.5 being associated with higher proportions of Hispanic residents and lower proportions of White residents. The findings from this study underscore the importance of environmental justice as it relates to firework-related air pollution exposure, and the critical role city- and county-level firework policies play in determining exposure.

AB  - SDG 8 calls for promoting 'sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all'. Even as it highlights the importance of labour rights for all, it also makes visible some significant tensions. We note, for example, that despite many critiques of narrow economic measures of growth, the focus here remains on GDP and per capita growth. This is problematic, we argue, because the GDP productive boundary excludes much of social reproductive work. This puts SDG8 in tension with SDG 5 which calls for the recognition of the value of unpaid care and domestic work. There has been a significant increase in the rate of working women in the formal and informal sector. However, there has not been a subsequent gender shift in the doing of social reproductive work. In this paper we argue SDG 8's focus on decent work and economic growth is inadequate; that productive employment and decent work for all men and women by 2030 needs to take into account the value and costs of social reproduction. We trace key historical debates on work to argue that both gender and labour rights have to underpin SDG 8 if its promise of inclusive, sustainable and decent work is to be realized.

AB  - In this paper, we draw upon Goffman's symbolic interactionism to analyze the ways in which new users in developing countries have adopted ICT to present and manage contradictory self-images to different groups of the public. In particular, we show that the Acapu, an indigenous group in the Amazon, present themselves through online videos and websites as ideal Indians: innate forest stewards aiming to mitigate climate change and ensure the planet's environmental sustainability. At the same time, the Acapu are also represented through a complex computer simulation model as destructive "cowboys": farmers and ranchers who are willing to develop by clearing their forests in the absence of financial compensation. This research shows that these two opposing self-images, while contradictory, are necessary for the implementation of REDD projects (a payment mechanism for reducing greenhouse emissions from deforestation). In order to obtain carbon credits from avoided deforestation, the project relies on the difference between deforestation measurements and high levels of predicted deforestation, which in turn, depend on the presentation of destructive self-images through the use of a complex computer simulation. But to sell these credits on a voluntary carbon market, it is necessary for the Acapu to openly market a self-image through the Internet which is attractive to corporate buyers willing to boost their eco-friendly profile. Based on this analysis, the paper challenges the narrative whereby Southern ICT users are passive receivers of technological black boxes. In contrast, it shows that in some cases these new users may participate in the creation of ICT artifacts to manage the impressions of distant audiences. Furthermore, the paper calls attention to the role of computer simulations and other ICT applications in concealing the paradoxes of neoliberal environmental management practices.

AB  - Conventional jet fuels derived from fossil sources contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, leading to climate change. Recent studies have shown that biobased jet fuels from different feedstocks offer a more sustainable alternative to conventional fuels as they are derived from renewable biomass, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The major feedstocks reviewed are jatropha curcas, camelina, karanja oil, waste cooking oil, and municipal solid waste. They offer diverse benefits for sustainable aviation fuel development. As a comparative analysis, this review examined jet fuel characteristics based on their physicochemical properties, namely energy content, viscosity, calorific value, cetane number, and freezing and flash points. The objective was to understand the influence of the properties on performance evaluation, environmental impact, and combustion characteristics. The properties of biojet fuels are compared with their fossil counterparts to validate their suitability as renewable alternatives and their benefits in terms of emissions reduction and engine performance. Biojet fuels perform better in terms of lower sulfur content, lower soot content, and a lower freezing point, their aromatic content, and their high cetane number. This study enhances the understanding of biojet fuels and their quality, and supports the development of sustainable fuel options. Overall, adherence to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D7566-18 standard is crucial for the acceptance and integration of biojet fuels into the aviation sector. Future research should explore feedstocks such as wood biomass, wastepaper, and agricultural residues for biojet fuels. It should also investigate the combustion and emission characteristics of biosourced aviation fuel at higher blending ratios (>50% by volume) with fossil Jet A-1.

AB  - The structural changes in an economy that accompany its growth to high-income status have been predictable in Europe, the United States, and Asia, characterized by declining employment in agriculture and rising levels of urbanization driven by jobs in the modern industrial sector. As agricultural productivity rises, the share of people employed in agriculture declines, and both urbanization and employment in manufacturing increase. Food prices fall relative to wages, causing the share of income spent on food to decline to very low levels. Asian countries have followed a similar path, although at a much faster pace. Africa, however, is different. Despite a high share of the population in urban areas, most African countries have yet to see significant increases in agricultural productivity that might drive industrial growth and jobs. The rising share of urban population has not been matched by increases in agricultural productivity, falling food prices, or the emergence of a viable industrial sector. Available evidence shows that agricultural yields in Africa are low and food is costly, while the share of employment in agriculture remains high. For the process of structural transformation to get underway, African countries must invest in the manufacture of fertilizer, develop better methods of water control, improve transportation, and invest in cold storage. Each of these interventions requires significant amounts of energy, including energy from fossil fuels, and they are not replaceable-countries have managed structural transformation in different ways but to date none have leapfrogged the process.</p>

AB  - The population of the Yellow-breasted Bunting Emberiza aureola, a formerly widely distributed and abundant songbird of northern Eurasia, suffered a catastrophic decline and a strong range contraction between 1980 and 2013. There is evidence that the decline was driven by illegal trapping during migration, but potential contributions of other factors to the decline, such as land-use change, have not yet been evaluated. Before the effects of land-use change can be evaluated, a basic understanding of the ecological requirements of the species is needed. We therefore compared habitat use in ten remaining breeding regions across the range, from European Russia to Japan and the Russian Far East. We also assessed large-scale variation in habitat parameters across the breeding range. We found large variation in habitat use, within and between populations. Differences were related to the cover and height of trees and shrubs at Yellow-breasted Bunting territories. In many regions, Yellow-breasted Buntings occupied early successional stages, including anthropogenic habitats characterized by mowing, grazing, or fire regimes. We found that the probability of presence can be best predicted with the cover of shrubs, herbs, and grasses. Highest probabilities were found at shrub cover values of 40%-70%. Differences in habitat use along a longitudinal gradient were small, but we found strong differences across latitudes, possibly related to habitat availability. We conclude that the remaining Yellow-breasted Bunting populations are not limited to specific habitat types. Our results provide important baseline information to model the range-wide distribution of this critically endangered species and to guide targeted conservation measures.

AB  - Social and technological innovations often spread through social networks as people respond to what their neighbors are doing. Previous research has identified specific network structures, such as local clustering, that promote rapid diffusion. Here we derive bounds that are independent of network structure and size, such that diffusion is fast whenever the payoff gain from the innovation is sufficiently high and the agents' responses are sufficiently noisy. We also provide a simple method for computing an upper bound on the expected time it takes for the innovation to become established in any finite network. For example, if agents choose log-linear responses to what their neighbors are doing, it takes on average less than 80 revision periods for the innovation to diffuse widely in any network, provided that the error rate is at least 5% and the payoff gain (relative to the status quo) is at least 150%. Qualitatively similar results hold for other smoothed best-response functions and populations that experience heterogeneous payoff shocks.

AB  - Climate change impacts on diverse cultural heritage is gaining scholarly and policy attention, yet little research has been conducted on how can diverse cultural heritage inform decisionmakers and policymakers in achieving climate change actions (i.e., climate change adaptation and mitigation). For this study, we conducted semi-structured interviews with Dutch cultural heritage and environmental or climate change experts (n = 52) and participant observations across the Netherlands to explore the importance of cultural heritage benefits and their relation to climate change actions. We also explored the perceptions of cultural heritage management over time, including the influence of climate policy on heritage practice in the Netherlands. Our findings show that experts perceived a multiplicity of heritage benefits as important in supporting and informing present and future climate change actions. The most salient benefits were informational benefits where diverse cultural heritage is perceived as an important source of knowledge about past societal, economic and environmental developments and changes. Further, heritage management was perceived as constantly changing over time, reflecting the transformative nature of diverse heritage types. Experts agreed that climate policy has already influenced cultural heritage practice in the Netherlands. Lastly, the interrelationships between heritage benefits and management were identified and characterised. This study informs both cultural heritage and climate change research agendas and helps leverage diverse cultural heritage into climate change adaptation and mitigation policies.

AB  - Grain was the most important food source in Europe during the early modern period (c. c . 1500- 1800). The price level of grain and its volatility played a pivotal role in determining food security and, ultimately, societal and human well-being. Conflicting findings have been reported as to what extent early modern grain price volatility decreased over time. We systematically reassess early modern grain price variability, using 69 annual price series of barley, oats, rye and wheat, and different statistical methods to obtain insights into spatio-temporal changes. Over the entirety of Europe, the different grain types showed a strong price correlation, implying a low level of food security, but the price inter-correlation between grain types decreased over time - indicating an improved level of food security. Grain price volatility significantly decreased over time, especially after c . 1725 and at coastal locations, lessening the risk of food stress and reflecting market improvement from the perspective of consumers. Changes in price volatility closely followed changes in price levels until the mid-seventeenth century, when both started to be increasingly independent of each other, partly owing to less abrupt volatility changes. The largest increase in both price level and volatility is observed during the 'price revolution' of the late sixteenth century as well as during the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648). In general, a high-price-low volatility pattern (and vice versa) ) is found throughout the early modern period and especially during the seventeenth century. This relationship, however, exhibits a somewhat geographically heterogeneous pattern, although with lower prices but higher volatility predominating in inland regions. To summarise, our results support the assumption that the level of food security improved over time and especially during the eighteenth century, but at the same time reveal considerable differences between grain types, measures considered, and geographical regions. The findings of this study point towards the need for further research on the geographical patterns of grain price variability and the factors explaining them.

AB  - The satoyama landscape is a traditional Japanese rural land-use system that represents a balanced relationship between human beings and nature, thereby sustaining a variety of ecosystem services, including the diversity of secondary natural environments. Overuse of the satoyama, as occurred during the Edo and early Meiji periods, as well as underuse as seen in the wake of the fuel and fertilizer revolutions of the 1960s, destroy this balance and hence the sustainability of this system. The Satoyama Initiative is an effort to rebuild a healthy relationship between nature and people who respect the traditional knowledge embodied in the satoyama system, and to explore new shared management systems ("new'' commons) in which various actors, including corporations, participate in working toward the combined goals of a low-carbon, resource-circulating, nature-harmonious society. In the interests of furthering cooperation with developing nations, it is important that this initiative pay heed to the need for improved agricultural, forestry, and livestock industry productivity that harmonizes with the natural environment, and to the improvement of human well-being and the reduction of poverty.

AB  - Infectious plant diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms, such as fungi, oomycetes, bacteria, viruses, phytoplasma, and nematodes. Plant diseases have a significant effect on the plant quality and yield and they can destroy the entire plant if they are not controlled in time. To minimize disease-related losses, it is essential to identify and control pathogens in the early stages. Plant disease control is thus a fundamental challenge both for global food security and sustainable agriculture. Conventional methods for plant diseases control have given place to electronic control (E-monitoring) due to their lack of portability, being time consuming, need for a specialized user, etc. E-monitoring using electronic nose (e-nose), biosensors, wearable sensors, and 'electronic eyes' has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Detection, identification, and quantification of pathogens based on electronic sensors (E-sensors) are both convenient and practical and may be used in combination with conventional methods. This paper discusses recent advances made in E-sensors as component parts in combination with wearable sensors, in electronic sensing systems to control and detect viruses, bacteria, pathogens and fungi. In addition, future challenges using sensors to manage plant diseases are investigated.

AB  - Munich, Berlin, Hamburg, Vienna, and Zurich - the largest cities in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland - have significantly reduced the car share of trips over the past 25 years in spite of high motorisation rates. The key to their success has been a coordinated package of mutually reinforcing transport and land-use policies that have made car use slower, less convenient, and more costly, while increasing the safety, convenience, and feasibility of walking, cycling, and public transport. The mix of policies implemented in each city has been somewhat different. The German cities have done far more to promote cycling, while Zurich and Vienna offer more public transport service per capita at lower fares. All five of the cities have implemented roughly the same policies to promote walking, foster compact mixed-use development, and discourage car use. Of the car-restrictive policies, parking management has been by far the most important. The five case study cities demonstrate that it is possible to reduce car dependence even in affluent societies with high levels of car ownership and high expectations for quality of travel.

AB  - Bavaria's energy policy seeks to increase the share of power supply from renewable sources related to on-farm energy production (agricultural biogas, wind- and solar energy) from currently 15% to more than 30% in 2021. It is therefore of particular interest for policy-makers to identify regional drivers of and barriers to this concept. The presented study addresses this issue and applies a spatial regression analysis to Bavaria's 71 rural counties. The findings indicate significant impacts of technological regional transformation ability, agricultural structure (degree of professionalization and consolidation of organic farming) and neighborhood effects. This is in contrast to most geographical factors, which seem to be of minor relevance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Regional variations in the environmental impacts of plant biomass production are significant, and the environmental impacts associated with feedstock supply also contribute substantially to the environmental performance of biobased products. Thus, the regional variations in the environmental performance of biobased products are also significant. This study scrutinizes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with two biobased products (i.e., ethanol and soybean oil) whose feedstocks (i.e., corn and soybean) are produced in different farming locations. We chose 40 counties in Corn Belt States in the United States as biorefinery locations (i.e., corn dry milling, soybean crushing) and farming sites, and estimated cradle-to-gate GHG emissions of ethanol and of soybean oil, respectively. The estimates are based on 1 kg of each biobased product (i.e., ethanol or soybean oil). The system boundary includes biomass production, the biorefinery, and upstream processes. Effects of direct land use change are included in the greenhouse gas analysis and measured as changes in soil organic carbon level, while the effects of indirect land use change are not considered in the baseline calculations. Those indirect effects however are scrutinized in a sensitivity analysis. GHG emissions of corn-based ethanol range from 1.1 to 2.0 kg of CO(2) equivalent per kilogram of ethanol, while GHG emissions of soybean oil are 0.4-2.5 kg of CO(2) equivalent per kilogram of soybean oil. Thus, the regional variations due to farming locations are significant (by factors of 2-7). The largest GHG emission sources in ethanol production are N(2)O emissions from soil during corn cultivation and carbon dioxide from burning the natural gas used in corn dry milling. The second largest GHG emission source groups in the ethanol production system are nitrogen fertilizer (8-12%), carbon sequestration by soil (-15-2%), and electricity used in corn dry milling (7-16%). The largest GHG emission sources in soybean oil production are N(2)O emissions from soil during soybean cultivation (13-57%) and carbon dioxide from burning the natural gas used in soybean crushing (21-47%). The second largest GHG emission source groups in soybean oil production are carbon sequestration by soil (-29-24%), diesel used in soybean cultivation (4-24%), and electricity used in the soybean crushing process (10-21%). The indirect land use changes increase GHG emissions of ethanol by 7-38%, depending on the fraction of forest converted when newly converted croplands maintain crop cultivation for 100 years. Farming sites with higher biomass yields, lower nitrogen fertilizer application rates, and less tillage are favorable to future biorefinery locations in terms of global warming. For existing biorefineries, farmers are encouraged to apply a site-specific optimal nitrogen fertilizer application rate, to convert to no-tillage practices and also to adopt winter cover practices whenever possible to reduce the GHG emissions of their biobased products. Current practices for estimating the effects of indirect land use changes suffer from large uncertainties. More research and consensus about system boundaries and allocation issues are needed to reduce uncertainties related to the effects of indirect land use changes.

AB  - The European Union (EU) is a major importer of forest-risk commodities (FRCs) and thereby bears significant responsibility for the dangerous trend of global deforestation and forest degradation. On 17 November 2021, the European Commission took a courageous first step towards reducing the EU's global deforestation footprint, by putting forward a legislative proposal to regulate trade in FRCs. The article analyses this proposal and explains why we consider it to be necessary and justified. Although we identify some important shortcomings in the proposal, particularly in relation to the protection of land tenure rights, we argue that the EU has a moral responsibility to avoid being complicit in the destruction of forests worldwide. We also suggest that the proposed regulation needs to be better designed to be compatible with the law of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and notably with regards to its country benchmarking system and cooperation with affected exporting countries.

AB  - Nitrogen supplied to wheat crops to increase grain productivity is being scrutinized because of its role in greenhouse gas emissions. Nitrogen affects food quality as well as food security because it increases grain protein content and can change wheat protein composition, both of which affect the rheological properties of dough made from the grain. This review explores the relationship between nitrogen functionality, wheat protein content and the ratio of gliadins to glutenins through critical assessment of recent studies on nitrogen fertilization of wheat. Moreover, by studying how variations in protein content and the gliadins/glutenins ratio affect the shear and extensional rheological properties of the dough, this review elucidates the direct role of nitrogen on wheat flour dough behavior during processing because process operations primarily employ extensional and shear forces. Nitrogen uptake by wheat plants leads to an increase in wheat protein content and changes in the glia-dins/glutenins ratio. Confounding factors associated with wheat plant growth and dough preparation make it difficult to definitively separate effects of wheat protein content from effects of wheat protein composition on dough rheology. Nevertheless, in general, higher protein content is associated with larger gliadins/glutenins ratios, resulting in wheat flour doughs that are more extensible.

AB  - We examined the hypothesis that adapting to ecosystem change on working landscapes can be enhanced by supporting the place-based stewardship values of landowners. On the basis of responses to a survey of more than 500 landowners across a landscape dominated by working lands, we clustered landowners into five groups based on their sense of place meanings. Relationships with the land are differentiated by the degree to which an owner's land makes positive contributions to well-being and the degree to which the land supports livelihoods. Positive contributions to well-being are related to stronger stewardship-oriented management styles, yet a combination of well-being and livelihood dependence is most closely related to increased sensitivity to ecosystem transformation. In a social-ecological system dominated by private lands, understanding an individual's relationship with the land is central to understanding adaptive capacity and for identifying policy options to successfully respond to ecological transformation.

AB  - The effectiveness of agri-environment schemes (AESs), the largest conservation-related expenditure for farmland biodiversity conservation within the European Union, is often compromised by a limited spatial scale of implementation. We focused on multiannual forage crops, a surrogate habitat for grassland birds, to assess the scale-dependent effects of mowing timing and frequency on the local population size of an iconic species, the skylark (Alauda arvensis). While there is much evidence for a negative impact of in-field mowing activities on grassland birds, whether such effects occur also at broader spatial scales is largely unknown. We surveyed breeding skylarks in the Po Plain (northern Italy) to determine (1) the association between landscape composition/configuration and abundance and (2) how abundance is affected by forage crop mowing timing and frequency. We addressed both questions through scale optimisation, identifying the most influential spatial scales for each covariate. Forage crop mowing timing was assessed through a novel remote sensing algorithm based on high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite images. We observed a strong scale dependence on the importance of different habitats in determining skylark abundance. Abundance increased with an increasing cover of forage crops locally (200 m) and of winter crops at a landscape scale (2600 m), suggesting that the species is favoured by heterogeneous agroecosystems. Locally (150-350 m), skylarks were more abundant when crops were aggregated, being negatively impacted by crop fragmentation caused by urbanization and by seminatural habitats. At the landscape scale (1150 m), the timing of mowing was consistent across years, with early-mown areas supporting fewer skylarks. This is probably because, over longer temporal scales, early-mown forage patches have limited or null productivity, eventually limiting local population size. Synthesis and applications. We provide a new perspective on the overarching influence of spatial scale in driving the abundance of a declining farmland bird species, supporting the urgency of designing landscape scale-effective AESs. This should be framed within the new EU Common Agricultural Policy reform and operated by farmer collectives, whereby management interventions should be monitored by state-of-the-art remote sensing techniques. These results suggest that implementing scale-optimized AESs could be crucial for effective farmland biodiversity conservation. L'efficacia delle misure agro-ambientali - la principale spesa dell'Unione Europea per la conservazione della biodiversit & agrave; nelle aree agricole - risulta spesso compromessa da un'applicazione a scala spaziale ridotta. Questo lavoro si incentra sulle colture foraggere poliennali, considerate un habitat surrogato per gli uccelli di ambienti aperti, al fine di valutare gli effetti scala-dipendenti delle tempistiche e della frequenza dello sfalcio sulla dimensione delle popolazioni locali di una specie iconica, l'Allodola (Alauda arvensis). Sebbene siano disponibili numerose evidenze di impatti negativi dello sfalcio per gli uccelli a scala locale, rimane in gran parte ignoto se tali effetti si manifestino anche a scale spaziali pi & ugrave; ampie. Le Allodole nidificanti sono state censite in un'area di studio della Pianura Padana (Italia settentrionale) per determinare l'associazione tra l'abbondanza della specie e: 1) composizione/configurazione del paesaggio; 2) fenologia e frequenza dello sfalcio delle colture foraggere. & Egrave; stato adottato un processo di ottimizzazione, identificando le scale spaziali pi & ugrave; influenti sull'abbondanza di allodole nidificanti per ciascuna covariata. Le variabili relative agli sfalci sono state ottenute attraverso un algoritmo di telerilevamento innovativo basato su immagini satellitari Sentinel-2 ad alta risoluzione. I risultati evidenziano una forte dipendenza dalla scala spaziale sull'associazione fra diversi habitat e abbondanza dell'Allodola. L'abbondanza aumenta con una maggiore copertura di colture foraggere a scala locale (200 m) e con una maggiore presenza di colture autunno-vernine a scala di paesaggio (2600 m), indicando che la specie & egrave; favorita da agroecosistemi eterogenei. A scala locale (150-350 m), le allodole risultano pi & ugrave; abbondanti in paesaggi agricoli aggregati, risultando invece negativamente influenzate dalla frammentazione delle colture determinata dall'urbanizzazione e dalla presenza di habitat seminaturali. A scala di paesaggio (1150 m), la fenologia dello sfalcio & egrave; risultata coerente in anni diversi e le aree sfalciate precocemente ospitavano un numero inferiore di allodole. Probabilmente ci & ograve; dipende dal fatto che, nel lungo periodo, le aree coltivate a foraggio sfalciate precocemente hanno una produttivit & agrave; limitata o nulla, influenzando negativamente la dimensione della popolazione locale a quella scala. Sintesi e applicazioni - Questo lavoro fornisce una nuova prospettiva sulla rilevanza della scala spaziale nel determinare l'abbondanza di una specie di uccello di ambienti agricoli in declino, sottolineando l'urgenza di definire misure agro-ambientali efficaci a scala di paesaggio. Si ritiene che tali interventi debbano essere inquadrati nel contesto della nuova riforma della Politica Agricola Comune dell'UE e attuati da aggregazioni di agricoltori, con interventi gestionali monitorati mediante tecniche di telerilevamento. I risultati suggeriscono che l'implementazione di misure agro-ambientali ottimizzate spazialmente potrebbe risultare cruciale per la conservazione della biodiversit & agrave; nelle aree agricole.

AB  - Short-rotation woody crops (SRWC) along with other woody biomass feedstocks will play a significant role in a more secure and sustainable energy future for the United States and around the world. In temperate regions, shrub willows are being developed as a SRWC because of their potential for high biomass production in short time periods, ease of vegetative propagation, broad genetic base, and ability to resprout after multiple harvests. Understanding and working with willow's biology is important for the agricultural and economic success of the system. The energy, environmental, and economic performance of willow biomass production and conversion to electricity is evaluated using life cycle modeling methods. The net energy ratio (electricity generated/life cycle fossil fuel consumed) for willow ranges from 10 to 13 for direct firing and gasification processes. Reductions of 70 to 98 percent (compared to U.S. grid generated electricity) in greenhouse gas emissions as well as NOx, SO2, and particulate emissions are achieved. Despite willow's multiple environmental and rural development benefits, its high cost of production has limited deployment. Costs will be lowered by significant improvements in yields and production efficiency and by valuing the system's environmental and rural development benefits. Policies like the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), federal biomass tax credits and renewable portfolio standards will make willow cost competitive in the near term. The avoided air pollution from the substitution of willow for conventional fossil fuel generated electricity has an estimated damage cost of $0.02 to $0.06 kWh(-1). The land intensity of about 4.9 x 10(-5) ha-yr/kWh is greater than other renewable energy sources. This may be considered the most significant limitation of willow, but unlike other biomass crops such as corn it can be cultivated on the millions of hectares of marginal agricultural lands, improving site conditions, soil quality and landscape diversity. A clear advantage of willow biomass compared to other renewables is that it is a stock resource whereas wind and PV are intermittent. With only 6 percent of the current U.S. energy consumption met by renewable sources the accelerated development of willow biomass and other renewable energy sources is critical to address concerns of energy security and environmental impacts associated with fossil fuels.

AB  - Forest harvest residues are important raw materials for bioenergy in regions practicing forestry. Removing these residues from a harvest site reduces the carbon stock of the forest compared with conventional stem-only harvest because less litter in left on the site. The indirect carbon dioxide (CO2) emission from producing bioenergy occur when carbon in the logging residues is emitted into the atmosphere at once through combustion, instead of being released little by little as a result of decomposition at the harvest sites. In this study (1) we introduce an approach to calculate this indirect emission from using logging residues for bioenergy production, and (2) estimate this emission at a typical target of harvest residue removal, i.e. boreal Norway spruce forest in Finland. The removal of stumps caused a larger indirect emission per unit of energy produced than the removal of branches because of a lower decomposition rate of the stumps. The indirect emission per unit of energy produced decreased with time since starting to collect the harvest residues as a result of decomposition at older harvest sites. During the 100 years of conducting this practice, the indirect emission from average-sized branches (diameter 2 cm) decreased from 340 to 70 kg CO2 eq. MWh-1 and that from stumps (diameter 26 cm) from 340 to 160 kg CO2 eq. MWh-1. These emissions are an order of magnitude larger than the other emissions (collecting, transporting, etc.) from the bioenergy production chain. When the bioenergy production was started, the total emissions were comparable to fossil fuels. The practice had to be carried out for 22 (stumps) or four (branches) years until the total emissions dropped below the emissions of natural gas. Our results emphasize the importance of accounting for land-use-related indirect emissions to correctly estimate the efficiency of bioenergy in reducing CO2 emission into the atmosphere.

AB  - When a plant increases resource allocation to reproduction from its limited reserves, the allocation to the other functions is reduced. Because of these trade-offs, differences in reproductive allocation are believed to result in relative differences in life history traits. Dioecious plants provide an excellent opportunity for detecting such possible trade-offs in resource allocation. This study aims to present a finding about the gender-based cost of reproductive allocation. The trade-off between reproduction and foliage biomass allocation was examined in Rhamnus davurica and Rhamnus schneideri at different modular levels (shoot/sub-branch, branch, and shrub/tree level). There were no intra-annual trade-offs between reproduction and foliage biomass in either sex of either species at shoot/sub-branch level, branch level and shrub level. Inter-annual trade-offs were detected in females for both species. Inter-annual trade-offs existed at all three different modular levels in R. schneideri females, while the evidence of inter-annual trade-offs was only detected at branch level in R. davurica females. At the population level, the sex ratio was female-biased in 2010, and it did not significantly deviate from 1: 1 in 2011 in R. davurica. However, the sex ratios were significantly female-biased in both 2010 and 2011 in R. schneideri. This study show that the degree of autonomy of the different plant organs influences the trade-offs between reproduction and growth, which suggests a species- and sex-dependent modular autonomy.

AB  - Reptile assemblages across agricultural landscapes: where does biodiversity hide?-The transition from traditional to intensive farming, aimed at large scale production, has rapidly altered agricultural landscapes, leading to the reduction and fragmentation of natural habitats and to the consequent loss of biodiversity. Herpetofauna is seriously threatened by agriculture intensification worldwide, but less is known about its distribution in agro-ecosystems, especially at field scale. We analysed reptile abundance and diversity in eight agricultural and semi natural land uses, and inside vegetated buffer strips interspersed among fields. Interestingly, most reptiles were recorded in the buffer strips while intensive crops and pastures hosted just one lizard species. Richness of individuals and species increased when strips were connected to semi natural areas, independently of their width and vegetation structure. In view of our results, that highlight the role of minor landscape features for the presence of vertebrates in intensive agro-ecosystems, we recommend the implementation of buffer strips among the measures for vertebrate conservation in agricultural landscapes.

AB  - For the primary purpose of minimizing carbon dioxide emissions in a megalopolis, an optimization model that remarkably reduces carbon emissions for the megalopolis, which is based on the inexact chance-constrained linear programming (ICCLP) method and incorporates interval linear programming (ILP), and chance constrained programming (CCP), has been constructed. The corresponding net emissions of carbon dioxide results in probability levels of default equalling p(i)=0.01, 0.05, 0.1 are [1,383.379, 1,825.311]x 10(4), [1,357.728, 1,800.841]x10(4), [1,338.671, 1,780.060]x10(4) tons in the megalopolis in 2015. Besides, the areas of different types of carbon-sinkable land of various cities within planned regions are obtained. The volume of energy consumption of dominating energy consumption industries in planned regions equals [965.52, 1,136.79]x10(4) tons, which is reduced by [14.97, 22.09]%, while the intensity of energy consumption is decreased by [18.00, 20.00]% compared with that in 2010. Meanwhile, the intensities of carbon emissions are reduced by 20.00%, 19.00%, and 18.08%, respectively, under the conditions of p(i)=0.01, 0.05, 0.1. It meets the requirements that carbon intensity shall be cut down by 17.00% in 2015 compared with that in 2010, which was proposed by "The 12th Five-Year Initiative of Controlling Greenhouse Gas Emissions!' The annual average GDP growth rate is 12.20%, reaching 9.79x 10(11) yuan in total, higher than the expected annual growth rate of 10% in accordance with the development objective of "12th Five-Year" plan.

AB  - Purpose The objective of the study is to understand the reasons for the resilience of rural periodic markets. Small retailers patronise these markets, and by identifying the reasons for their continued market participation, an attempt has been made to explain the continued existence of these traditional evolved retail agglomerations. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative research design was adopted for the study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 35 small retailers, and responses were used to identify the reasons for their continued market participation. A mix of purposeful and snowball sampling was used to select the respondents. Findings In a novel endeavour, this study presents rural periodic markets as an evolved retail agglomeration. It identifies six factors responsible for the continued participation of small retailers in these markets. Seven attributes of the rural periodic market, an evolved retail agglomeration, were also identified which contribute to the resilience of these markets. Research limitations/implications This study contributes to the literature on retail agglomerations and identifies the reasons for the continued market participation of small retailers, suggesting some trends about their future in emerging economies. Social implications Rural periodic markets have affected the overall well-being of surrounding villages by providing opportunities to participate in many ways. This has been identified as a reason for the economic growth of the area. Originality/value To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to explore the resilience of periodic markets from the perspective of small retailers by identifying the reasons for their continued market participation.

AB  - 1. Spatial food distribution determines resource profitability, defensibility and encounter rate of foragers. Clumped food distribution can promote aggressiveness and resource monopolisation, in turn increasing within-group variation in food intake and growth. However, the effects of food distribution may depend on foraging strategies. Little is known about the impact of spatial food heterogeneity on growth and grouping behaviour in social foragers in the absence of monopolisation. 2. Social foraging is present in many fishes, particularly at early juvenile life stages when fish are especially sensitive to environmental variation. Here, a heterogeneous food distribution may impair foraging success and growth and juveniles may increase sociability to attain social information about food resources. 3. We examined the impact of the spatial distribution of food as well as inbreeding on growth and social behaviour in juveniles of the cichlid fish Pelvicachromis pulcher. Inbred individuals often show poorer performance than outbred individuals (inbreeding depression), but inbreeding effects can be environment dependent. In the experiment, inbred and outbred fish were reared in a split-clutch design either under homogeneously distributed or spatially clumped food conditions for 8 weeks starting 1 week after juveniles could actively feed. We documented growth and performed a shoaling assay and a sociality test (choice between a large vs. a small shoal) after 6 weeks. 4. Spatial food distribution did not affect within-group body length variation, but individuals reared under clumped food conditions were smaller. Shoals of the different feeding conditions differed in social behaviour. Shoals of the clumped treatment group showed higher variation in inter-individual distances compared to shoals of the homogeneous treatment group. Furthermore, focal fish of the clumped treatment adjusted their association preference to the position of the groups' largest individual. We did not find significant inbreeding or environment-dependent inbreeding effects regarding growth or social behaviour. 5. Our study suggests that a clumped food distribution can impede localisation of food resources and thus growth in juvenile social foragers. Accordingly, in heterogeneous environments, the use of social information may be highly relevant to increase individuals' foraging success potentially explaining orientation on successful foragers, that is, large individuals. Inter-individual variation in juvenile's social behaviour may precede variation in food monopolisation capability and in growth emerging at later life stages.

AB  - The Central European agricultural landscape has undergone a number of changes over recent decades, with overall field area decreasing and adjacent habitats increasing. Here, we document changes in small mammal communities associated with crop fields and adjacent fallow land in a highly agriculture landscape of the Czech Republic. The most numerous species overall were wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) and common voles (Microtus arvalis). Highest diversity, species richness and abundance were observed in fallow habitats and in crops providing long-term vegetation cover. Community composition and abundance were dependent on crop and season. Mice used all habitats depending on instantaneous vegetation stage, though some habitats only for a short period during seeding or harvest. Common voles reached highest densities in habitats providing a stable food supply. Mice and voles both preferred perennial "non-crop" plots during winter as they provided a diverse food supply and undisturbed nesting opportunities. Overall, fallow habitats supported the most abundant, diverse and stable small mammal communities and, as such, they have high biodiversity value. (C) 2016 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde.

AB  - Purpose Existing research focuses on the pension systems and reforms in China from a macro-level and financial perspective. The expectations of mid-life Chinese people regarding their retirement and pensions have been ignored to date, and this research set out to address this lacuna. Design/methodology/approach The application of qualitative research methods is relatively novel in Chinese social science. As a grounded theory (GT) study, the research reported here deployed semi-structured interviews to investigate middle-aged Chinese women's and men's perceptions of their pensions and retirement. In total, 36 interviews were conducted, following the constructivist GT method. Findings The data point to disparities between the choices and perceptions of individuals on the one hand and the official assumptions underlying the current pension regime on the other hand. Research participants had varying interpretations of the inequality in retirement incomes in China, the main division being between enterprise workers and public-sector employees. Originality/value Although there are in principle rigidly fixed retirement ages for men and women in contemporary China, the phenomena of early retirement and working post-retirement are increasing. There are trade-offs between work/retirement and family needs, which influence the choices of middle-aged citizens. Retirement pathways are increasingly individualised, reflecting broader patterns of individualisation and inequality in China.

AB  - With a market capitalisation of over $1.84 trillion dollars and large annual flows, the Superannuation Guarantee has been regarded as the backbone of Australia's retirement policy scheme and a primary driver of economic growth. However, losses encountered in the aftermath of the global financial crisis led to a major review of superannuation, mainly in response to the lack of accountability, comparability, and transparency discovered within default' investment options. An outcome of this review was the MySuper initiative, which imposes obligations on fund providers to reconfigure their default investment strategies in accordance with new regulatory requirements. Despite these policy reforms, other challenges remain, such as gender inequality, excessive superannuation fees, low financial literacy, and lack of member participation in growing retirement savings. The paper provides a review of literature pertaining to the background, significant policy changes, and ongoing development of the Australian superannuation system. We emphasise the role of superannuation in the economy; characteristics of the industry, plans, and funds on offer; recent policy initiatives; and perceived inadequacies of the system. The paper concludes with possibilities for further empirical research.

AB  - The universal contamination of arable land with potentially toxic elements (PTEs) poses a severe threat to food security and jeopardizes worldwide efforts to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). How to obtain more reliable concentrations of PTEs in regional agricultural soils is a priority problem to be solved. Multispectral satellite remote sensing, with its advantages of high spatial and temporal resolution, broad coverage, and low cost, offers the potential to acquire spatial distribution of PTEs in agricultural soils over large areas. However, owing to the complexity of soil environments and the insufficiency of spectral information, the mechanism for retrieving concentrations of PTEs in agricultural soils via multispectral satellites is not yet clear, and the accuracy needs to be improved. In this study, we aimed to assess whether employing a fusion of spectral information and environmental covariates, results in more accurate retrievals of PTEs, specifically chromium (Cr) and mercury (Hg), in croplands than does employing spectral information alone. Three machine learning algorithms-kernel-based support vector machine (SVM), neural network-based back propagation neural network (BPNN), and tree-based extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-were developed to retrieve Cr and Hg concentrations in agricultural soils. The results showed that the fusion of spectral information and environmental covariates combined with the XGBoost model performed best in retrieving both Cr and Hg concentrations in agricultural soils with coefficient of determination (R-2) values of 0.73 and 0.74, respectively. Environmental covariates were important variables for determining Cr and Hg concentrations in agricultural soils, but the ability to retrieve these element concentrations by utilizing spectral information alone was limited. High Cr concentrations occurred in central towns and southern hilly mountains. High Hg concentrations were detected in the northwestern region and southern hilly mountains. The potential of fusing spectral information and environmental covariates to precisely retrieve PTE concentrations in agricultural soils can serve as a reference for agricultural soil health information monitoring worldwide.

AB  - An ecosystem service is a benefit derived by humanity that can be traced back to an ecological process. Although ecosystem services related to surface water have been thoroughly described, the relationship between atmospheric water and ecosystem services has been mostly neglected, and perhaps misunderstood. Recent advances in land-atmosphere modeling have revealed the importance of terrestrial ecosystems for moisture recycling. In this paper, we analyze the extent to which vegetation sustains the supply of atmospheric moisture and precipitation for downwind beneficiaries, globally. We simulate land-surface evaporation with a global hydrology model and track changes to moisture recycling using an atmospheric moisture budget model, and we define vegetation-regulated moisture recycling as the difference in moisture recycling between current vegetation and a hypothetical desert world. Our results show that nearly a fifth of annual average precipitation falling on land is from vegetation-regulated moisture recycling, but the global variability is large, with many places receiving nearly half their precipitation from this ecosystem service. The largest potential impacts for changes to this ecosystem service are land-use changes across temperate regions in North America and Russia. Likewise, in semi-arid regions reliant on rainfed agricultural production, land-use change that even modestly reduces evaporation and subsequent precipitation, could significantly affect human well-being. We also present a regional case study in the Mato Grosso region of Brazil, where we identify the specific moisture recycling ecosystem services associated with the vegetation in Mato Grosso. We find that Mato Grosso vegetation regulates some internal precipitation, with a diffuse region of benefit downwind, primarily to the south and east, including the La Plata River basin and the megacities of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. We synthesize our global and regional results into a generalized framework for describing moisture recycling as an ecosystem service. We conclude that future work ought to disentangle whether and how this vegetationregulated moisture recycling interacts with other ecosystem services, so that trade-offs can be assessed in a comprehensive and sustainable manner.

AB  - Two recent remote sensing derived products providing assessment of forest cover change in the Congo Basin for the last two decades were compared and combined to obtain estimates of forest cover change in Cameroon for the period 1990-2012. The intensity of deforestation in the whole region decreased from the 1990s to the 2000s. Forest loss is observed everywhere in Cameroon but present higher intensity nearby the Atlantic coast. The analysis of the spatial distribution of the forest loss in Cameroon reveals that an important part of the loss is happening outside the permanent and the non-permanent forest domain. The Landsat spatial resolution used in the two products allows us to capture change caused by agro-industrial exploitation as well as shifting cultivation, infrastructure and selective logging when the area affected is large enough. But it fails to monitor forest degradation and small scale deforestation events.

AB  - Geothermal energy is a sustainable and renewable energy source, which can be used in electricity production, space heating/cooling, and other industrial applications. In the recent years, it has been gathering more and more attention due to its numerous advantages as low impact on the surrounding environment, continuous power outputs, low greenhouse gas emissions, and worldwide availabilities. All make the geothermal energy a significant contributor to the global energy productions in an environmentally friendly way. One big concern of geothermal sources' exploration is the expensive investment costs of geothermal wells. Utilizing abandoned petroleum wells for the purpose of geothermal extraction is a novel idea. Well temperature profiles help to estimate how much heat can be transferred and produced from the wells. In this paper, a literature review has been done to investigate the existing applications on geothermal energy extraction utilizing abandoned petroleum wells. Then, the case study demonstrates the importance of properties of working fluids, wellbore architecture, and operational parameters (circulation rate, inlet temperature, etc.) in geothermal energy production. The obtained results can be used to achieve an improved data interpretation and generate more optimal solutions. In geothermal projects, extensive knowledge of the heat transfer is of great importance for the economical aspect and the performance of wells. Our work demonstrates that it is a good approach to provide cost-effective solutions to enhance heat extraction from geothermal wells.

AB  - Adaptive building envelope systems have the potential of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving the energy flexibility of buildings, while maintaining high levels of indoor environmental quality. The development of such innovative materials and technologies, as well as their real-world implementation, can be enhanced with the use of building performance simulation (BPS). Performance prediction of adaptive facades can, however, be a challenging task and the information on this topic is scarce and fragmented. The main contribution of this review article is to bring together and analyse the existing information in this field. In the first part, the unique requirements for successful modelling and simulation of adaptive facades are discussed. In the second part, the capabilities of five widely used BPS tools are reviewed, in terms of their ability to model energy and occupant comfort performance of adaptive facades. Finally, it discusses various ongoing trends and research needs in this field.

AB  - Europe has been implementing eco-labelling on forest products for the last two decades as a market-oriented tool to combat forest degradation and manage forest resources sustainably. Numerous studies have investigated the impacts of eco-labelling from different perspectives and geographic locations. Nevertheless, holistic reviews to disentangle the impacts of eco-labelling on forest sustainability are lacking. This study proposes a conceptual framework to collate and qualitatively analyse the existing literature regarding forest eco-labels for disclosing its effects on social, ecological, and economic sustainability. With regard to social sustainability, forest eco-labelling has established itself as a credibility icon that enhanced end-consumption patterns and successfully institu-tionalised the discourse over customary rights, despite insufficient procedural justice for indigenous communities and workers. In the economic dimension, forest eco-labelling enhanced market competitiveness; however, increasing costs continue to be a huge setback for producers. The ecological dimension demonstrated restored landscapes as a result of disturbance reductions. Nonetheless, the insufficient preservation of trees and areas with high conservation values during felling have undermined forest integrity and biodiversity protection. More rigorous marketing strategies and campaigns might be needed to address the profitability issue. Also, quanti-tative measures for on-the-ground performance should be enacted to leverage the unique strengths of forest eco-labelling in institutionalising cross-sector cooperation and normalising environmental discourses in forestry.

AB  - Carrion of large animals is an extremely nutrient rich, ephemeral resource that is essential for many species, but is scarce in the anthropogenic Western-European landscape due to legislative restrictions. Rewilding, a novel conservation strategy that aims at restoring natural processes with minimal human intervention, is increasing in popularity and could lead to increased carrion availability in the landscape. It is therefore important to understand the effects of carrion on biodiversity. We investigated the direct and delayed (five months) effects of red deer (Cervus elaphus) carcasses on plants and arthropods in the Oostvaardersplassen, the Netherlands, one of the oldest rewilding sites in Europe. Specifically, we tested whether carrion has a positive direct effect on the abundances and diversity of various arthropod functional groups, as well as a delayed effect on the vegetation and arthropods through the increased nutrient availability. During the active decomposition stage in spring, we, not surprisingly, observed higher abundances of carrion associated species (scavengers and their specialized predators) at the carrion sites than at control sites without carrion, but no higher abundances of predators or detritivores. In late summer, after nearcomplete decomposition, plant biomass was five times higher, and nutritional plant quality (C:N ratio) was higher at the carrion sites than at the control sites. Arthropod abundance and diversity were also manifold higher, owing to higher numbers of herbivorous and predatory species. Regression analysis showed that abundances of herbivores and detritivores were positively related to plant biomass, and predator abundances were positively related to abundances of herbivores and detritivores, suggesting bottom-up effects propagating through the food chain. Our results show that even in a naturally nutrient-rich ecosystem like the Oostvaardersplassen, carrion can have strong positive effects on local plant biomass and nutritional quality and arthropod abundances, lasting the whole growing season. We found evidence that these effects were first directly caused by the presence of carrion, and later by the enhanced nutrient availability in the soil. This highlights the importance of the indirect pathways by which carrion can structure arthropod communities.

AB  - The influence of carbohydrate (honey) on host acceptance and egg retention was studied in adult Trichogramma principium. The presence of honey reduced the percentage of ovipositing females and the mean number of eggs laid during 2 days. Consequently, in mass rearing when Trichogramma is usually presented to factitious hosts for a short time, providing wasps with carbohydrate may decrease progeny production. The mean number of mature ovarial eggs in non-ovipositing females was much higher than in ovipositing females in both fed and starved wasps. The adaptive role of the positive correlation between food supply and egg retention in Trichogramma is discussed.

AB  - Isoetid macrophytes such as Lobelia dortmanna and Littorella uniflora are engineering species with an extensive root system and high radial oxygen loss. Despite several studies on these macrophytes, the effect of their oxygenation on methane dynamics has never been investigated. In this study, we hypothesise that isoetids promote dissolved inorganic carbon fixation and methane oxidation in sandy sediments. Our whole-ecosystem approach study lasted 2 years (2013-2014) on two oligo-mesotrophic shallow lakes. Benthic chamber incubations confirmed that, as a result of primary production and methanotrophy, isoetid lawns had consistently lower benthic carbon fluxes than bare sediments. On a daily basis, vegetated areas acted as a carbon sink (-0.7 +/- 0.4 g C m(-2) days(-1), as DIC + CH4), whereas bare sediments acted as a net source (0.6 +/- 0.5 g C m(-2) days(-1), as DIC + CH4). Photosynthetic quotients of < 1 indicated that photosynthetically produced oxygen was not released into the water column, but accumulated in leaf lacunae or was transferred to the rhizosphere, that contributing to the alteration of net benthic fluxes at the sediment-water interface. This preliminary study highlights the necessity of further investigating the role that isoetids play in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from temperate shallow lakes.

AB  - The sustainable use of water resources is of utmost importance given climatological changes and water scarcity, alongside the many socioeconomic factors that rely on clean water availability, such as food security. In this context, developing tools to minimize water waste in irrigation is paramount for sustainable food production. The evapotranspiration estimate is a tool to evaluate the water volume required to achieve optimal crop yield with the least amount of water waste. The Penman-Monteith equation is the gold standard for this task, despite it becoming inapplicable if any of its required climatological variables are missing. In this paper, we present a stochastic Bayesian framework to model the non-linear and non-stationary time series for the evapotranspiration estimate via Bayesian regression. We also leverage Bayesian networks and Bayesian inference to provide estimates for missing climatological data. Our obtained Bayesian regression equation achieves 0.087 mm center dot day-1 for the RMSE metric, compared to the expected time series, with wind speed and net incident solar radiation as the main components. Lastly, we show that the evapotranspiration time series, with missing climatological data inferred by the Bayesian network, achieves an RMSE metric ranging from 0.074 to 0.286 mm center dot day-1.

AB  - Mexico is relatively advanced in its preparation for international policy on Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) and has many of the pre-conditions needed to support a community approach in the implementation of a national REDD+ programme, particularly as regards tenure of forests and experience with community forest management and PES schemes, although these conditions do not pertain everywhere. One critical issue that is yet to be resolved concerns rights to carbon credits and distribution of the financial benefits flowing from REDD+. We demonstrate that attribution of carbon credits from reduced deforestation and degradation at the community level is virtually impossible from a technical viewpoint, since these credits are counterfactual. Payments based on assessment of performance of each community in terms of such reductions would moreover be inequitable and inefficient. Flat rate payments in return for agreed improvements in management are likely to be more motivating and much easier to administer. However, increases in carbon stock (forest enhancement) can be physically measured on site, and could be more easily attributed to each individual community. We therefore propose a system in which reduced deforestation and degradation are considered environmental services, with credits accruing to national government. The financial value of the credits may be used to finance flat rate payments to communities who agree to implement improved management. On the other hand, credits for forest enhancement, which reflect measurable increases in carbon in the communities' trees, would be considered environmental goods. These should be considered the direct property of the owners of the forest (in the same sense as wood or poles) and it would be possible for communities to sell these credits themselves. We acknowledge however that many other problems face implementation of REDD+ in Mexico, and provide a number of important examples. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Quality assurance programs (QAPs) may add value to wines through reassuring consumers of wine quality prior to purchase and consumption. In Tennessee, the potential to use a wine QAP is being explored as a means to improve the industry's economic sustainability. To date, several QAPs exist, but studies directly related to their impact on consumer behavior for wines from emerging areas are scarce. We used an online survey instrument to elicit consumer perceptions of QAPs importance on wine purchasing decisions and how the presence of a QAP may impact their purchasing behavior for a wine from an emerging area (e.g., Tennessee). Wine involvement, QAP perceptions, and familiarity were also measured. A mixed-process model was used to estimate the two ordered probit models for importance of QAPs and the influence of QAPs on Tennessee wine purchases, where QAP importance was treated as a latent variable influencing Tennessee wine purchases. Ordinal probit estimates suggest that greater on-site spending and greater perceived benefits of QAPs (as indicators of quality and standardization) resulted in a higher probability of perceived QAP importance when making wine purchasing decisions. Reduced form estimates of the model of Tennessee wine purchases indicated distance to wine producing areas, female gender, and familiarity with Tennessee wines each negatively influenced the potential impact of QAPs on Tennessee wine purchases. However, on-site spending at wineries and perceived benefits of a Tennessee QAP increased likelihood of Tennessee wine purchases.

AB  - Although riparian vegetation is widely acknowledged for its positive impact on soil and water quality and its role in regulating terrestrial greenhouse gas emissions in agricultural landscapes, there remains a gap in understanding how different types of riparian vegetation affect aquatic greenhouse gas production. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate whether the type of vegetation within riparian zones influenced aquatic environmental factors, subsequently impacting aquatic greenhouse gas emissions. To address this, we measured greenhouse gases in the aquatic environment bordered by riparian zones with herbaceous vegetation (GRS) compared to undisturbed natural riparian forests dominated by deciduous (UNF-D) or coniferous (UNF-C) vegetation or a rehabilitated riparian forest (RH). Our findings indicate that aquatic CO2 concentrations were not influenced (p < 0.05) by vegetation type ranging from 9 g L-1 to 11 g L-1. In contrast, aquatic CH(4 )concentrations were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in treed riparian zones, ranging from 14 mu g L(-1 )to 24 mu g L-1, compared to a riparian zone with herbaceous vegetation (34 mu g L-1). However, we observed significantly higher (p < 0.05) aquatic N2O concentrations in treed riparian zones (9.5 <mu>g L-1 to 10.3 mu g L-1), particularly those dominated by coniferous vegetation (23.0 mu g L- 1), compared to the riparian zone with herbaceous vegetation (7.7 mu g L- 1). The total CO2-C equivalent (i.e., CO2 + CH4 + N2O) was highest in the riparian zone with coniferous trees (UNF-C: 10,717 mg CO2-Ceq L-1), followed by the GRS (9494 mg CO2-Ceq L-1), RH (9423 mg CO2-Ceq L-1) and UNF-D (9,183 mg CO2-Ceq L-1) riparian zone. Moreover, riparian vegetation was influenced by various environmental factors that likely controlled physicochemical and biological processes related to the production of greenhouse gases within the aquatic environment.

AB  - A major weapon in Canada's CO2-emissions reduction arsenal is reliance on moral suasion and voluntary action. In this regard, the Voluntary Challenge and Registry (VCR) program constitutes a major effort to encourage industrial firms to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper, we begin by providing a critical review of Canadian climate change policy and Canada's international commitments. We then investigate the effectiveness of Canadian policies by analyzing a survey of industrial firms, examining factors that determine firms' familiarity with, participation in and commitment to the VCR program, and their stated potential to reduce emissions by 2008-2012 (Kyoto's commitment period). Results indicate that voluntary programs are unlikely to make a significant contribution to emissions reduction, with industrial firms indicating that, on average, they plan to reduce emissions by some 1-2% below their 1990 level under the current policy approach, much lower than Canada's 6% reduction target.

AB  - RNA interference (RNAi)-based transgenic technologies have evolved as potent biochemical tools for silencing specific genes of plant pathogens and pests. The approach has been demonstrated to be useful in silencing genes in insect species. Here, we report on the successful construction of RNAi-based plasmid containing an interfering cassette designed to generate dsRNAs that target a novel v-ATPase transcript in whitefly (Bemisia tabaci), an important agricultural pest in tropical and sub-tropical regions. The presence of the transgene was confirmed in T-0 and T-1 generations of transgenic lettuce lines, segregating in a Mendelian fashion. Seven lines were infested with whiteflies and monitored over a period of 32 days. Analysis of mortality showed that within five days of feeding, insects on transgenic plants showed a mortality rate of 83.8-98.1%. In addition, a reduced number of eggs (95 fold less) was observed in flies feeding on transgenic lettuce plants than insects on control lines. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR showed decreased expression level of endogenous v-ATPase gene in whiteflies feeding on transgenic plants. This technology is a foundation for the production of whitefly-resistant commercial crops, improving agricultural sustainability and food security, reducing the use of more environmentally aggressive methods of pest control.

AB  - France has constrained the Aquitaine region to set up a climate plan to avoid an emission of 2883 ktCO(2)eq for the period 2007-2013. In parallel, the region has decided to carry out the construction of road infrastructures in order to avoid very high congestion costs. Those road projects will involve an increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during that period. In the present context of strong sustainability, all emissions (direct and indirect) generated by those projects should be offset. At the regional level, the offsetting of GHG emissions is usually carried out by implementing carbon sequestration projects or projects that reduce energy demand. This paper aims at determining the maximum budget for financing GHG emissions offsetting projects, with computation being based on the opportunity costs of projects, the minimum cost of economic activity reduction required to offset emissions from those projects. The maximum budget devoted to GHG emissions offsetting projects should not exceed (sic)(2001) 1920 M to (sic)(2001) 3592 M, according to low/high traffic growth assumptions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The unknown consequences and potential impacts of mankind's ability to destroy, alter, or manipulate ecosystems on a vast scale drives our need to better understand the earth system. A fundamental challenge for soil science in the 21st century is to understand the role of soil processes in relation to the function of the earth system. The rationale for developing a definition of sod natural capital stems from the premise that we value 'things' based on their perceived value to human well-being. As a consequence, ignorance of the value of a resource, or system, may lead to its neglect and omission from decision making. Therefore, there is a need to develop a definition of soil natural capital, fitting within a broad framework, which can be used to assess soil ecosystem services that contribute to the function of the earth system. Though various definitions of soil natural capital have been proposed, mostly in the agricultural context, it still remains a nebulous and ill-defined term. The objective of this paper is to develop an embracing definition of soil 'natural capital' focusing on (i) mass, (ii) energy, and (iii) organization/entropy. Mass is further subdivided into solid, liquid and gas phases, and organization into physicochemical, biotic, and spatiotemporal structure. We differentiate between two aspects of capital, the quantity and the quality. As a result of our definition, soil moisture, temperature, and structure emerge as valuable stocks, alongside the more traditionally viewed stocks such as inorganic (mineralogy, texture) and organic materials (OM content). We go on to demonstrate how natural capital fits within the ecosystem services framework, and how using integrated valuation and process based models it can be evaluated. Finally we discuss measurement and monitoring needs that fit with this vision of evaluation.

AB  - Silvopasture is the deliberate integration of a woody component with grazed pastures as understorey. It is one of the most extended agroforestry practices all over the world. Silvopasture use is key to increase the sustainability of livestock farming systems as silvopasture reduces the use of concentrates since the woody component provides feed for animals. However, it is not an extensively used practice in Europe. This paper aims at evaluating, from Eurostat, LUCAS database and the 118 rural development programs, the current situation of permanent grasslands in the Mediterranean area of Europe as well as the rural development programmes fostering silvopasture to better understand how sustainable land use systems are promoted and provide insights to foster silvopasture across Europe. The results of this study show that most of the policy measures related to silvopasture are adapted to the local necessity. The already existing agroforestry managed land (dehesas/montado) are related to measures supporting regeneration and maintenance while in those areas where agroforestry does not exist the measures are related to forest fire prevention.

AB  - Projections pertaining to future land use and land use change may have diverse backgrounds. Often, both local and scientific knowledge encompass important pieces of information for such a projection. Acknowledging the diversity across the two types of knowledge, we investigated their differences and similarities in a twofold case study, conducting a participatory mapping (PM) exercise with local wine growers, as well as a Multi Criteria Evaluation (MCE) with non-local experts from science, government and industry. Hence, we not only utilised two different knowledge elicitation methods, but also two types of 'Knowledges'. Within a region dominated by vineyards, and with expected land use change, we compared the two results quantitatively, in a participatory evaluation workshop, and with annotations gained through the participatory mapping exercise. Both methods have their merits, with the results from the participatory mapping perceived as being more plausible, and the MCE scoring higher in terms of spatial resolution. Whilst the participatory mapping yields more and better contextualised information, the results from the MCE can be better compared across study areas.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) now shelter 54% of the remaining forests of the Brazilian Amazon and contain 56% of its forest carbon. However, the role of these PAs in reducing carbon fluxes to the atmosphere from deforestation and their associated costs are still uncertain. To fill this gap, we analyzed the effect of each of 595 Brazilian Amazon PAs on deforestation using a metric that accounts for differences in probability of deforestation in areas of pairwise comparison. We found that the three major categories of PA (indigenous land, strictly protected, and sustainable use) showed an inhibitory effect, on average, between 1997 and 2008. Of 206 PAs created after the year 1999, 115 showed increased effectiveness after their designation as protected. The recent expansion of PAs in the Brazilian Amazon was responsible for 37% of the region's total reduction in deforestation between 2004 and 2006 without provoking leakage. All PAs, if fully implemented, have the potential to avoid 8.0 +/- 2.8 Pg of carbon emissions by 2050. Effectively implementing PAs in zones under high current or future anthropogenic threat offers high payoffs for reducing carbon emissions, and as a result should receive special attention in planning investments for regional conservation. Nevertheless, this strategy demands prompt and predictable resource streams. The Amazon PA network represents a cost of US$147 +/- 53 billion (net present value) for Brazil in terms of forgone profits and investments needed for their consolidation. These costs could be partially compensated by an international climate accord that includes economic incentives for tropical countries that reduce their carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation.

AB  - Energy-efficient and sustainable technologies are necessary to lower energy and carbon footprints. Many technologies are being pursued to meet the increasing energy demand in buildings. An attractive option is efficient utilization of available energy resources, including renewables, to support current and future building energy needs while targeting grid resiliency, energy, and environmental security at an affordable cost via on-site cogeneration-based approaches. This must include energy-efficient technologies with lower greenhouse gas emissions and optimized cost, performance, and reliability. This paper presents the economic and environmental benefits associated with power technologies such as thermionics and solid oxide fuel cells. Hybrid configurations consisting of heat pumps, power systems, and renewable photovoltaics in cogeneration and trigeneration modes of operation are presented. The role of such technologies in lowering CO2 emissions while improving energy resiliency and serving the needs of underprivileged communities is discussed. The key barriers of affordability and potential solutions for large-scale implementation of these promising technologies are reviewed. Case studies demonstrating the influence of power rating, electrical efficiency, design configuration, carbon dioxide intensity of the grid, and fuel on annual greenhouse gas emissions are presented for residential and commercial buildings.

AB  - Remote-sensing ocean colour studies have already been used to determine coastal water quality, coastal biodiversity, and nutrient availability. In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with multispectral sensors, originally designed for agriculture applications, have also enabled water-quality studies of coastal waters. However, since the sea surface is constantly changing, commonly used photogrammetric methods fail when applied to UAV images captured over water areas. In this work, we evaluate the applicability of a five-band multispectral sensor mounted on a UAV to derive scientifically valuable water parameters such as chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration and total suspended solids (TSS), including a new Python workflow for the manual generation of an orthomosaic in aquatic areas exclusively based on the sensor's metadata. We show water-quality details in two different sites along the Maltese coastline on the centimetre-scale, improving the existing approximations that are available for the region through Sentinel-3 OLCI imagery at a much lower spatial resolution of 300 m. The Chl-a and TSS values derived for the studied regions were within the expected ranges and varied between 0 to 3 mg/m(3) and 10 to 20 mg/m(3), respectively. Spectral comparisons were also carried out along with some statistics calculations such as RMSE, MAE, or bias in order to validate the obtained results.

AB  - The impacts of global climate change on dryland fungi have been understudied even though fungi are extremely sensitive to changes in the environ ment. Considering that many fungi are pathogens of plants and animals, including humans, their responses to anthropogenic change could have important implications for public health and food security. In this study, we investigated the potential physiolog ical responses (i.e., metatranscriptomics) of pathogenicity and stress in dryland fungi exposed to global change drivers, drought, and the physical disturbance associated with land use. Specifically, we wanted to assess if there was an increase in the transcrip tion of genes associated to pathogenicity and stress in response to global change drivers. In addition, we wanted to investigate which pathogenicity and stress genes were consistently differentially expressed under the different global change conditions across the heterogeneous landscape (i.e., microsite) of the Chihuahuan desert. We observed increased transcription of pathogenicity and stress genes, with specific genes being most upregulated in response to global change drivers. Additionally, climatic conditions linked to different microsites, such as those found under patches of vegetation, may play a significant role. We provide evidence supporting the idea that environmental stress caused by global change could contribute to an increase of pathogenicity as global climate changes. Specifically, increases in the transcription of stress and virulence genes, coupled with variations in gene expression, could lead to the onset of pathogenicity. Our work underscores the importance of studying dryland fungi exposed to global climate change and increases in existing fungal pathogens, as well as the emergence of new fungal pathogens, and consequences to public health and food security. IMPORTANCE The effects of global climate change on dryland fungi and consequen ces to our society have been understudied despite evidence showing that pathogenic fungi increase in abundance under global climate change. Moreover, there is a grow ing concern that global climate change will contribute to the emergence of new fungal pathogens. Yet, we do not understand what mechanisms might be driving this increase in virulence and the onset of pathogenicity. In this study, we investigate how fungi respond to global change drivers, physical disturbance, and drought, in a dryland ecosystem in terms of pathogenicity and stress. We find that indeed, under global change drivers, there is an increase in the transcription and expression of genes associated to pathogenicity and stress, but that microclimatic conditions matter. Our study shows the importance of investigating dryland fungi exposed to global climate change and impacts on our society, which may include threats to public health and food security.

AB  - A major goal of today's energy policy is to establish an energy system with less greenhouse gas emissions (cf. "Renewable energy roadmap" [1]). The energetic use of biomass seems to be a very promising option to contribute to this goal: biomass can be used demand-oriented and to produce different energy carriers (e.g. power, heat and biofuels) needed within the energy system. Due to high overall efficiencies, especially the thermo-chemical conversion of solid biofuels to the natural gas substitute Bio-SNG (Synthetic Natural Gas) seems to be very promising. Therefore, it is the goal of this paper to analyse Bio-SNG production processes as a part of integrated polygeneration processes. Different Bio-SNG concepts using a gas slip stream in a gas engine or a gas turbine and process heat in an organic rankine cycle or conventional steam cycle are assessed. Based on mass and energy balances these concepts are discussed from an energetic, economic and environmental point of view. The analysis shows increasing exergetic efficiencies as well as improved economic and environmental process characteristics with increasingly integrated processes. However, the economic competitiveness still remains a bottleneck for a Bio-SNG market implementation. Therefore, two possible options to improve this competitiveness are discussed in detail.

AB  - Recent progress towards demonstrating inertial confinement fusion (ICF) ignition at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) has sparked wide interest in Laser Inertial Fusion Energy (LIFE) for carbon-free large-scale power generation. A LIFE-based fleet of power plants promises clean energy generation with no greenhouse gas emissions and a virtually limitless, widely available thermonuclear fuel source. For the LIFE concept to be viable, target costs must be minimized while the target material efficiency or x-ray albedo is optimized. Current ICF targets on the NIF utilize a gold or depleted uranium cylindrical radiation cavity (hohlraum) with a plastic capsule at the center that contains the deuterium and tritium fuel. Here we show a direct comparison of gold and lead hohlraums in efficiently ablating deuterium-filled plastic capsules with soft x rays. We report on lead hohlraum performance that is indistinguishable from gold, yet costing only a small fraction.

AB  - While considerable progress has been made in understanding land use change, land system science continues to face a number of grand challenges. This paper discusses these challenges with a focus on empirical land system studies, land system modelling and the analysis of future visions of land system change. Contemporary landscapes are contingent outcomes of past and present patterns, processes and decisions. Thus, empirical analysis of past and present land-use change has an important role in providing insights into the socio-economic and ecological processes that shape land use transitions. This is especially important with respect to gradual versus rapid land system dynamics and in understanding changes in land use intensity. Combining the strengths of empirical analysis with multi-scale modelling will lead to new insights into the processes driving land system change. New modelling methods that combine complex systems thinking at a local level with macro-level economic analysis of the land system would reconcile the multi-scale dynamics currently encapsulated in bottom-up and top-down modelling approaches. Developments in land use futures analysis could focus on integrating explorative scenarios that reflect possible outcomes with normative visions that identify desired outcomes. Such an approach would benefit from the broad and in-depth involvement of stakeholders in order to link scientific findings to political and societal decision-making culminating in a set of key choices and consequences. Land system models have an important role in supporting future land use policy, but model outputs require scientific interpretation rather than being presented as predictions. The future of land system science is strongly dependent on the research community's capacity to bring together the elements of research discussed in the paper, via empirical data collection and analysis of observed processes, computer simulation across scale levels and futures analysis of alternative, normative visions through stakeholder engagement.

AB  - The Soy Moratorium is an initiative to reduce deforestation rates in the Amazon biome based on the hypothesis that soy is a deforestation driver. Soy planted in opened areas after July 24th, 2006 cannot be commercialized by the associated companies to the Brazilian Association of Vegetable Oil Industries (ABIOVE) and the National Association of Cereal Exporters (ANEC), which represent about 90% of the Brazilian soy market. The objective of this work is to present the evaluation of the fourth year of monitoring new soy plantations within the Soy Moratorium context. With the use of satellite images from the MODIS sensor, together with aerial survey, it was possible to identify 147 polygons with new soy plantations on 11,698 ha. This soy area represents 0.39% of the of the total deforested area during the moratorium, in the three soy producing states of the Amazon biome, and 0.6% of the cultivated soy area in the Amazon biome, indicating that soy is currently a minor deforestation driver. The quantitative geospatial information provided by an effective monitoring approach is paramount to the implementation of a governance process required to establish an equitable balance between environmental protection and agricultural production.

AB  - The main objective of this work is to review the recent achievements on the mechanisms explaining local and rural development, which underpin the current definition of rural areas in the European literature. The analysis carried out in this article acknowledges a gap between local development processes and the current representation of rural diversity by international organisations and national/regional authorities. New concepts can be drawn from this comparative analysis: 1) rural diversity cannot be explained exclusively by agglomeration forces and geographical distance from urban centres; b) multiple functions of rural areas, often rooted into sustainable agri-food systems or other forms of territorial capital, contribute to explain more autonomous roles of rural areas; c) organised or relational proximity is emerging in a context of a globalised economy and non-geographical networks, as a critical factor of connection between rural areas and distant regions/markets. This article translates these different disciplinary developments into a practical and integrated conceptual approach, in which local development processes result from three components: local resource systems, networks, institutions and enabling policies.

AB  - In South Africa, 4x4 ecotrails that fall into the adventure tourism category are increasing in popularity. The purpose of this study is to compile a profile of 4x4 trail users, identify their motives and then determine critical success factors (CSFs) for the management of 4x4 trails. The comprehension of the coherence between the travel motives that lead to a visit and the CSFs that determine whether visitors are satisfied and have gained a memorable experience (which should lead to repeat visits) is examined in this research. An online survey was conducted in South African National Parks and the focus was on ecotrails, which contribute to nature conservation and provide maximum sustainability. A total of 119 questionnaires were obtained. The results found seven motivations and CSFs, respectively, revealing two new motivational factors within this context (lifestyle and spiritual well-being) and three new CSFs that have not been identified before and put a clear focus on the trail itself (interpretation, trail planning and challenging experience). This information can be used by trail managers and marketers to reach this niche market and provide visitors with a memorable experience.

We also aim to problematise the apparent effects of the complex interrelationship between globalisation (corporatisation - managerialism and marketisation), HE reform and gender equity. Globalisation is perceived as holding both opportunity and threat to higher education - it defers redress in terms of gender equity. In some instances, fast tracking women into leadership positions has raised questions about sustainability, support and commitment to change. We have chosen to frame the issues through a small exploratory case study drawing on the experiences of five women in leadership(1) at one South African university.

Participating in this rethinking, this study elaborates on ethical practices in creative research where new materialist and arts-based methodologies intra-act with children and the sensitivities of gender and power in young peer cultures. Drawing on experiences from the authors' creative workshops, this paper investigates how new materialist creative practice allows children to explore and communicate their experiences of gender and power in safe and enabling ways. The authors suggest expanding their ethical practice by composing ethically sustainable encounters for children to engage with experiences of and visions for their peer cultures. They close by discussing practices for responding to the inherent un/safety of addressing gender and sexual abuses of power and for enabling microprocesses of change to - as a matter of sustainability - transform oppressive peer cultures towards social justice.

AB  - Digital technological innovations make new types of responses to conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) possible, bringing with them both potential promises and pitfalls. Aiming to provide a conceptual starting point for further analysis, this article problematizes the trend towards data extraction in exchange for aid, protection and justice, and argues for the importance of complementing technology-driven approaches to the struggle against CRSV with the inclusion of strategies for user participation and investment in digital literacy as key aspects of the response. To explore how the digital turn shapes the struggle against CRSV, the article offers a three-part analytical framework. First, the article unpacks how digital technologies create corresponding "digital bodies" - comprised of images, information, biometrics and other data stored in digital space - which represent the bodies of individuals affected by sexual violence, and which interplay with the risks posed upon the physical bodies of those facing CRSV. Second, the article maps out the role of digital technologies in a cycle of intervention, including prevention of, response to, documentation of and accountability for CRSV. Third, recognizing the increasing importance of data governance to the struggle against CRSV, the article considers how divergent humanitarian, human rights and international criminal law approaches to data may create different pathways for CRSV data. This could also give rise to new tensions in how international actors approach CRSV.

AB  - Sustainability is among the most important directions in global development. The challenge today is to reconcile the fastest possible economic growth and the pursuit of prosperity with concern for the environment. One of the important problems of modern economies and societies is to reduce overall consumption and implement new patterns of sustainable consumption and production. The main aim of this article was to analyze consumer preferences in terms of purchasing personalized production offered by implementing the concept of Industry 4.0 and ensuring sustainable consumption and production (SCP). Based on the analysis of the literature and the results of our own research, an attempt was made to estimate the impact of personalized production offered by the Industry 4.0 concept on SCP and thus the sustainable development of the economy. This article presents the results of a survey conducted on a selected group of consumers, focusing on learning about expectations, consumer preferences for personalized products and conscious consumption, and the results of a survey conducted using the Servqual method, determining the level of customer satisfaction with the purchase of personalized products. The most important achievement was to demonstrate a high level of consumer satisfaction with buying personalized products and the positive impact of personalized production on sustainable consumption. At the same time, the importance of developing the Industry 4.0 concept for supporting sustainable consumption-oriented consumer behavior is emphasized.

AB  - Karst springs are important water sources for both human needs and environmental flows. The responses of karst springs to hydrometeorological factors vary depending on local conditions. In this study, we investigated Martandnag spring in the Liddar catchment in the Kashmir valley of northern India. We used statistical time series (autocorrelation and cross-correlation) and machine-learning (ML) techniques (random forest regression (RFR) and support vector regression (SVR)) to characterize how rainfall, temperature, and snow cover affect the karst spring flow and predict the future responses of the spring stage based on climate scenarios, in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Report 6. The statistical time series showed that the memory effect of Martandnag spring varies from 43 to 61 days, indicating moderate karstification and a relatively high storage capacity of the karst aquifer in the Liddar catchment. The delay between recharge and discharge varies from 13 to 44 days, and it is more strongly correlated to snow/ice melt than to rainfall. The ML analysis shows that SVR outperformed RFR in predicting spring flow. Under all climate scenarios, a trained SVR model showed that spring flow increased during the late winter to early spring, and decreased during the summer (except in August) and in autumn. Scenarios with increased greenhouse gas emissions further reduced flow in the summer and autumn. These predictions can be helpful for water-resource planning in similar watersheds in the Western Himalayas.

Users interact with SARRA-Py primarily through Jupyter notebooks that provide guided workflows for data preparation, parameter configuration, and visualization of results. This design closes the gap between point-based crop models and broader geospatial frameworks, offering a practical tool for agricultural risk management, climate adaptation studies, and yield forecasting. Consequently, SARRA-Py fosters reproducible, scenario-based analyses and informs decision-making in vulnerable regions where water deficits, sparse ground observations, and climate variability threatens food security.

AB  - Artificial intelligence currently represents one of the most talked about topics, considering the need for sustainable economic growth at a global level. When it comes to education, artificial intelligence is aimed at enhancing systems, ways of learning, as well as at the results of learning, on the one hand, and training the youth so as to accordingly satisfy the requirements of their future jobs, on the other hand. In this context, research on higher education in Romania was conducted, which analysed the students' opinion on the social impact of using artificial intelligence in education. As a consequence of performing an opinion poll, answers were collected online from students from prestigious Romanian universities. The data registered for the mentioned objective was processed by applying three statistical and econometric logistic regression models. The results of the first binary logistic model sh ow the respondents' opinions on the need and importance of enhancing the learning experience by using artificial intelligence in education, considering their gender and level of education. Also, with respect to the two characteristics considered the most significant to the objective of the paper, the following two multinominal logistic models have been developed. The results highlight the way in which the use of artificial intelligence in education influences, on the one hand, the graduates' prospect for a job and, on the other hand, the society as a whole.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to systematically review male cosmetics consumption (CC) literature and, given the dearth of research about the topic, especially on Western emerging country contexts, to shed light on the paradoxical behaviour concerning male grooming by empirically assessing the impact of some psychological and demographic antecedents of consumption. Design/methodology/approach Six hypotheses derived from a systematic review of the literature were tested through structured equation modelling (SEM), based on data of 476 Brazilian men. Findings The results empirically sustain the positive influence of vanity and masculinity in grooming product consumption, with partial mediation of vanity between masculinity and consumption. Counterintuitively, it also confirms the negative influence of income. Age and marital status are not statistically relevant. Practical implications Practitioners should invest in marketing actions focusing on low-income men, who showed genuine interest in grooming products, promoting them as powerful tools to improve appearance and social recognition. Additionally, educational and wellness-related campaigns could be effective. Social implications Beyond profitability, economic growth and men's well-being, the results might affect the whole society through male cosmetics' contribution to blending gender paradigms. Originality/value This study focuses on an economically relevant segment that defies the status quo. It is the first to systematically demonstrate the state of the art of male CC knowledge and to illuminate the role of psychological and demographic variables in influencing CC, enriching the literature on appearance, gender and consumption.

AB  - Ecosystem service (ES) bundles can be defined as the temporal and spatial co-occurrence of ESs. ES bundles are jointly driven by socio-ecological factors and form at different scales. However, in recent research, a few studies have analyzed the dynamic evolution and driving mechanisms of ES bundles at different scales. Therefore, this study explored the spatial patterns of six ESs supplied in Dalian (China) from 2005 to 2015 at three spatial scales, determining the distribution and evolution patterns of ES bundles and their responses to socio-ecological driving factors. Our results are as follows: (1) We identified four ES bundles representing ecological conservation, water conservation, ecological depletion, and food supply. The developmental trajectory of each ES bundle could be attributed to the combined effects of environmental conditions and urban expansion. In particular, the water conservation bundle and food supply bundle were changed to the ecological depletion bundle. Given the ongoing urbanization, the conflict between ESs has intensified. (2) The impact of socio-ecological driving factors on ES bundles vary with scale. At three spatial scales, the digital elevation model (DEM) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) had a great impact on ES bundles. Urbanization indicators also strongly explain the spatial distribution of ES bundles at the county and grid scales. The interaction factor detector shows that there is no combination of mutual weakening, indicating that the formation of ES bundles is driven by multiple factors in Dalian. Overall, this study used a more holistic approach to manage the ecosystem by studying the temporal-spatial dynamics of the multiple ESs.

AB  - Nearly three quarters of older adults have multiple morbidities (MM). This study investigated which morbidities older adults prioritize, why, and how they accommodate these conditions, focusing on elders with two or more chronic conditions and low socioeconomic status. Methods. In-depth interviews were conducted with 41 older adults (most being African American women from the southeastern U.S., with two or more chronic illnesses). Results. Many participants reported worrying most about their heart disease, diabetes, and disability/mobility problems, and about their synergistic effects. Many worried that MMs might tip them into a downward spiral. Participants spent the most time and money on arthritis and diabetes. Few received help; when they did, relatives assisted with arthritis/mobility, diabetes, and effects of stroke. Discussion. Enhanced formal care coordination, increased use of technological innovations, and understanding elders' priorities are necessary to improve self-care/management and quality of life.

AB  - Important land use changes are expected in the European Union (EU) the coming decades, having effects on carbon stocks in soil and vegetation. We assessed how future land use change (LUC) can influence future carbon stock change in soil and vegetation in the EU. The emphasis is on the role of LUC in the overall carbon balance of the EU biosphere. Because LUC is the most dynamic driving factor of terrestrial carbon stock change, it is important to account for the dynamics of LUC in carbon stock change modelling. The major challenge in coupling a carbon model and a LUC model is the difference in spatial and temporal resolution generally used in these modelling approaches. We used a high-resolution LUC model and a carbon bookkeeping approach that takes into account effects of soil and forest age on carbon stock changes. These approaches best fit the chosen resolution and extent in a consistent manner. Four SIZES scenarios that cover a range of possible future developments were evaluated: Global Economy (A1): lean government, strong globalization; Continental Markets (A2): lean government, regional cultural and economic development; Global Cooperation (B1): much governmental intervention, strong globalization; Regional Communities (B2): much governmental intervention, regional cultural and economic development. If land use remains unchanged, carbon sequestration rates are expected to decrease by 4% in 2030 relative to 2000. LUC causes an additional sequestration rate decrease in the A2 scenario of 2% in 2030. In the other three scenarios, sequestration rate increases by 9-16% in 2030 relative to 2000. In 2030, the terrestrial biosphere in the EU is expected to sequester between 90 and 111 Tg C year(-1). This is 6.5-8% of the projected anthropogenic emissions. In the B2 scenario, the highest sequestration rate increase is expected (15 Tg C year(-1)). Clear differences are found in the spatial distribution of sinks and sources between the scenarios, illustrating that land use is an important factor in future carbon sequestration changes that cannot be ignored.

AB  - Natural sites in urban spaces can have a key role in citizen well-being, providing fundamental ecosystem services to the population and assuring a multitude of benefits. Therefore, cities should guarantee a number of green areas and their conservation in time as an essential part of urban architecture. In this framework, cooperation between scientists, decision makers and citizens is critical to ensure the enhancement of green public spaces. Social and scientific communities are called to work in a tuned way to combine scientific knowledge and methods to local socio-economic contexts, driven by the values of geoethics. The Bullicante Lake case study, discussed in this work, represents an example of application of geoethical values, such as inclusiveness, sharing, sustainability and conservation of bio- and geodiversity. This urban lake in Rome appeared following illegal excavation works in 1992 and remained closed until 2016 favouring re-naturalization processes. Over time, this site was often threatened by pending actions for building. The aim of this study was to highlight how fruitful cooperation between science and citizens is able to transform a degraded urban area into a place of knowledge, recreation, enjoyment and eco-systemic preservation. Moreover, on the basis of this experience, the authors proposed a generalised approach/strategy to be developed and applied in other contexts. The active involvement of citizens and the cooperation among scientists, artists and institutions were able to redress opportunistic behaviours well by preventing site degradation and its improper use, favouring environmental safeguarding and making possible the site's recognition as a natural monument. The results of these actions led to the improved quality of citizen life, showing an excellent example of virtuous cooperation between science and society.

AB  - Scientific expertise plays an important role in the complex field of climate policy. Consequently, science-policy interactions have been institutionalized in many countries. However, science-policy arenas vary considerably across countries. Scholars mainly attribute these differences to the influence of specific political cultures. The literature has primarily compared science-policy arenas of countries with diverging political cultures, whereas comparisons of countries with similar political cultures are rare. The latter is especially true for neo-corporatist cultures. Against this background, we compare the climate science-policy arenas of three neo-corporatist countries, Austria, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. Conceptually, we draw on the literature regarding politico-cultural imprints in science-policy arenas. We operationalize national science-policy arenas along four dimensions: the knowledge actors, the organizational formats, the styles of science-policy interactions, and their transparency and visibility. Overall, the three arenas reveal many similarities and much fewer differences. Most similarities correspond to neo-corporatist patterns. However, some similarities consistently deviate from neo-corporatist patterns. Interestingly, almost all differences between the countries match national variations of neo-corporatism. In light of these observations and the specific problem structure of climate policy, we develop research questions to investigate potential explanations for correspondence to and deviation from neo-corporatist patterns.

AB  - Sea turtle species have life cycles that have common features such as oviparity, nesting on sandy beaches, growing as juveniles in surface waters and moving to foraging grounds before migrating- often over long distances-to natal beaches to breed. They are therefore exposed to aquatic and terrestrial influences, both abiotic (e.g. temperature, weather) and biotic (e.g. food availability, predation). Humans have exploited sea turtles for millennia and pressure on their populations has increased dramatically during the ongoing Anthropocene as human influences have increased both in power and global reach. Fishing bycatches generated by powerful unselective gears have largely replaced direct fishing as an existential threat, but meat and egg poaching persist, while burgeoning global wildlife crime threatens sea turtles, especially hawksbills. Habitat loss caused by coastal development and exponential increases in beach-based tourism have reduced nesting success. Sustained losses of coral reef and seagrass habitats have removed foraging grounds for adult turtles and both habitat types are currently projected to disappear before 2100. Environmental degradation has taken several forms. Chemical pollution through the accumulation of organics and heavy metals have affected reproduction and facilitated the transmission of fibropapillomatosis. An emerging threat due to eutrophication also needs to be considered. Marine plastic pollution is already highly damaging to sea turtles; plastic fishing gears 'ghost-fish' indefinitely, capturing and killing all life-history stages except eggs, while ingestion of macro and microplastics blocks/damages guts. Rising global temperature has been identified as a potential existential threat for all species because of temperature-dependent sex determination and substantial sea level rise. However, climate change is also projected to cause an order of magnitude increase in the frequency of heat waves and extreme sea level highs, both of which can kill turtle embryos. This Praeger Review concludes with a description of sea turtle occurrences around the British Isles and the anthropogenic influences upon them.

AB  - Rubber plantations expanded remarkably in South-East Asia, while the impact of this land use change on soil carbon dynamics and greenhouse gases emissions has not been sufficiently understood. We measured monthly soil CO2 fluxes during one year as well as CH4 fluxes during the rainy season in secondary rainforest, 9 and 22 year-old rubber monoculture and 22-year-old rubber-tea intercropping in Xishuangbanna, Southwest China. Our aim was to assess the impact of the land use change on soil carbon fluxes and quantify the factors determining the difference in the carbon fluxes. A linear mixed effect model was used in studying the soil temperature and moisture variation and temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of soil respiration. The temporal pattern of soil respiration distinctly differed between sites during the rainy season: rainforest maintained a high soil respiration rate, while soil respiration became suppressed (by up to 69%) during the most moist period in rubber plantations. Rainforest soils thus emitted the highest amount of CO2 with an annual cumulative flux of 8.48 +/- 0.71 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), compared to 6.75 +/- 0.79, 5.98 +/- 0.42 and 5.09 +/- 0.47 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) for mature rubber, rubber-tea intercropping, and young rubber, respectively. Additionally, the soil CH4 uptake was stronger in rainforest than in rubber plantations during the wet period. Soil temperature was the main factor explaining the overall seasonal variation of soil respiration. Adding a quadratic soil moisture term into the model accounted for moisture effects, identified moisture tipping points, and improved temperature sensitivity assessment when high soil moisture suppressed soil respiration under rubber. Temperature sensitivity of soil respiration was higher for rainforest soil compared to rubber plantations, O-10 values were 3.1 for rainforest and 1.7, 2.2 and 2.4 for mature rubber, rubber-tea intercropping and young rubber respectively. Converting rainforest to rubber plantations tended to reduce soil CO2 emissions and weakened CH4 uptake especially during the very wet period. The altered condition of soil aeration under converted land appears to have a pronounced impact on processes of carbon fluxes from the soil and thus mitigates the positive feedback of climate change given the large area of cultivated rubber.

AB  - Salt marshes are known as major blue carbon ecosystems for their higher carbon sequestration capacity and productivity compared to terrestrial ecosystems. However, in Korea, salt marshes have been continuously decreasing since the 1980s. This study aims to identify seasonal changes in salt marsh plants and evaluate the carbon and nitrogen sequestration in these ecosystems. This study observed seasonal changes in the biomass, cover, height, photosynthetic efficiency, carbon and nitrogen content of Suaeda japonica in two salt marsh ecosystems in Incheon, Korea, Yeongjong (YJ) and Sorae (SR). In spring, plant density at SR. was significantly higher than at YJ. This higher density at SR inhibited growth and survival during summer and autumn. In addition, photosynthetic efficiency at SR decreased significantly in summer compared to spring. The different habitat densities between the two sites resulted in morphological variations. The plants at YJ, with lower density, grew wider with more branches and showed higher dry weight in comparison to those at SR. Carbon sequestration by S. japonica per unit area was 113.70 g/m2 at YJ, which was twice as high as at SR. The plant density and biomass of S. japonica were affected by differences in seawater inflow at each site. The tissue carbon content was highest in the roots, suggesting that carbon absorbed by the leaves is effectively stored in sediment. This study provides insights into the regional and seasonal changes of S. japonica, highlighting its significance as a blue carbon resource. The results can contribute to the evaluation and restoration of salt marshes to enhance their carbon sequestration potential.

AB  - Limited information on greenhouse gas emissions from tropical dry forest soils still hinders the assessment of the sources/sinks from this ecosystem and their contribution at global scales. Particularly, rewetting events after the dry season can have a significant effect on soil biogeochemical processes and associated exchange of greenhouse gases. This study evaluated the temporal variation and annual fluxes of CO2, N2O, and CH(4)from soils in a tropical dry forest successional gradient. After a prolonged drought of 5 months, large emissions pulses of CO(2)and N2O were observed at all sites following first rain events, caused by the "Birch effect," with a significant effect on the net ecosystem exchange and the annual emissions budget. Annual CO(2)emissions were greatest for the young forest (8,556 kg C ha(-1)yr(-1)) followed by the older forest (7,420 kg C ha(-1)yr(-1)) and the abandoned pasture (7,224 kg C ha(-1)yr(-1)). Annual emissions of N2O were greatest for the forest sites (0.39 and 0.43 kg N ha(-1)yr(-1)) and least in the abandoned pasture (0.09 kg N ha(-1)yr(-1)). CH(4)uptake was greatest in the older forest (-2.61 kg C ha(-1)yr(-1)) followed by the abandoned pasture (-0.69 kg C ha(-1)yr(-1)) and the young forest (-0.58 kg C ha(-1)yr(-1)). Fluxes were mainly influenced by soil moisture, microbial biomass, and soil nitrate and ammonium concentrations. Annual CO(2)and N2O soil fluxes of tropical dry forests in this study and others from the literature were much lower than the annual fluxes in wetter tropical forests. Conversely, tropical dry forests and abandoned pastures are on average stronger sinks for CH(4)than wetter tropical forests.

AB  - This paper investigates sectoral contributions to the trend of national wage share, or the labor income share, during 2000-2014 in China. I apply the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) decomposition, the method widely used in energy studies, to decompose the trend of the wage share. At a sectoral level, with rapid structural transformation, structural change negatively impacted the wage share through the between-sector effect - the structural and price effects - mainly from agriculture. This result confirms Arthur Lewis's hypothesis that structural transformation has a negative contribution to the wage share. At a national level, when the wage share declined before 2008, the between-sector effect was as significant as the within-sector effect - the wage and productivity effects. After 2008, the within-sector effect directed the increasing wage share trend. This implies that although structural transformation matters to the wage share in a large developing country like China, a wage-productivity nexus has been more influential and determined the increasing trend of the wage share since 2008.

AB  - Antibiotic pollution poses serious threats to public health and ecological processes. However, systematic research regarding the interactive effects of increasing nutrient and antibiotic pollutions on the prokaryotic community, particularly taxa that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, is lacking. By exploring the complex interactions that occur between interkingdom bacteria and archaea, biotic and abiotic factors, the responses of sediment prokaryotic assembly were determined along a significant antibiotic pollution gradient. Bacterial and archaeal communities were primarily governed by sediment antibiotic pollution, ammonia, phosphate, and redox potential, which further affected enzyme activities. The two communities nonlinearly responded to increasing antibiotic pollution, with significant tipping points of 3.906 and 0.979 mg/kg antibiotics, respectively. The combined antibiotic concentration-discriminatory taxa of bacteria and archaea accurately (98.0% accuracy) diagnosed in situ antibiotic concentrations. Co-abundance analysis revealed that the methanogens, methano-trophs, sulfate-reducing bacteria, and novel players synergistically contributed to methane cycling. Antibiotic pollution caused the dominant role of ammonia-oxidizing archaea in ammonia oxidation at these alkaline sediments. Collectively, the significant tipping points and bio-indicators afford indexes for regime shift and quantitative diagnosis of antibiotic pollution, respectively. Antibiotic pollution could expedite methane cycling and mitigate nitrous oxide yield, which are previously unrecognized ecological effects. These findings provide new insights into the interactive biological and ecological consequences of increasing nutrient and antibiotic pollutions.

AB  - As more solar photovoltaic panels are expected to be introduced globally to promote the stabilization and decarbonization of electricity supply, concerns have been raised about the associated resource constraints and the environmental impacts. To promote circular economy initiatives, this study aims to provide insight into the variables and the conditions that play a key role in the expression of environmental impacts and find the better path for a circular economy of solar panels, which requires analyzing impacts on multiple indicators as a result of various factors and their cross-interactions. To achieve this goal, we constructed a resource circulation simulator that considers factors related to the business environment as well as physical factors. The simulation model was then applied to the largest administrative region in Japan, and the parameter space was explored by combining Regional Sensitivity Analysis, a global sensitivity analysis method, and Random Forest to consider the interactions among these variables. As a result of 30,000 Monte Carlo simulations performed on 26 input variables, it was found that the key parameters in final disposal and resource consumption potential differ between the two purposes; avoiding catastrophic loads and achieving ambitious reductions. In contrast, for greenhouse gas emissions, it is important to maintain or increase the efficiency of photovoltaic panel power generation for both purposes. Additionally, in the case where the key variables were optimized in terms of final disposal/resource consumption potential, it will effectively reduce the two impacts to 0.7 % and 12.6 %, respectively, with a minimal negative impact on greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast, in the case when optimized in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, it has only a small impact on greenhouse gas emissions and large negative impacts on final disposal and resource consumption potential. Further refinement of the parameter space and thresholds in the analysis is a topic for future research.

AB  - Improved short-term wind forecasting for transmission system characteristics is needed to balance the power system with less stored capacity. Wind speed is studied using time-series analysis. Time series are repeated observations. Study of cost Energy efficiency reduces climate change, improves interior conditions, reduces air pollution to improve health, increases energy security, and determines cost-effectiveness for energy users. The hybrid optimization model for electrical renewables improves grid and off-grid electricity testing and design. It can model hybrid systems with generators, hydropower, wind turbines, batteries, solar PV, biomass, and fuel cells. Power engineers face challenges in identifying suitable energy sources, deciding the number of sources, and assessing and ensuring energy efficiency reductions. It optimizes and analyses system designs. This paper is split into 2 parts. Part 1 explains utilizing historical data to anticipate wind speed. The study examines an autoregressive integrated moving average model, an artificial neural networks model, and a hybrid model for shortterm wind speed prediction. The model's prediction accuracy considers root mean square error, mean absolute error and mean absolute percentage error. The hybrid model forecasts wind data best. The second section compares the energy efficiency of two microgrid models: an AC natural gas generator in model 1 and an AC diesel generator in model 2. This study uses a hybrid optimization model for electrical renewables pro to determine Jafrabad, Gujrat's most energy-efficient model. Two system setup examples were designed to find the best solution. In this article, projected wind data is supplied for two models as inputs of the wind turbine in the hybrid optimization model for electrical renewables pro to estimate energy cost, net present cost, and sensitivity analysis for both cases to assess microgrid changes due to solar radiation, wind speed, and fuel price. Pollutant/ greenhouse gas emissions are also compared for both cases.

AB  - Despite the deployment of low- or zero-emission technologies, achieving emissions reductions in the passenger transportation sector remains challenging. Demand-side mechanisms can be instrumental in reducing environmental impacts of transportation and reconfiguring transportation systems in a way that shifts users away from private car ownership. In this article we look at the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States to quantify the environmental benefits from such shifts in passenger transportation, considering socio-technological drivers of transportation including well-being, digitalization, shared mobility, and electrification. We establish pathways for each of these countries considering their context. We frame these pathways using the avoid-shift-improve framework which shapes the scenarios that we quantify in our analysis. We use a travel demand model as an input to calculate carbon, energy, and air pollution footprints. We quantify direct emissions considering the characteristics of the private fleet and indirect using multiregional input-output analysis. The results show that target thresholds can be reached under the proposed supply and demand initiatives. For the United States, these actions are more dramatic than for the Netherlands and Sweden due to that country's stronger car dependence. A deep social transformation is needed to make these scenarios possible and enable a shift towards public, active and shared transportation in urban areas.

Fundamentally divergent agricultural policies in each country have been crucially shaped by the strength of agrarian political parties, rural trade unions and links with the agricultural bureaucracy. Technical considerations and structural economic conditions, on the other hand, have been at best secondary influences. In turn, the degree and character of political organization amongst agricultural producers in large part reflect the historical legacies of the particular political transition path followed by each country.

AB  - Organic farming is an eco-friendly and sustainable farming practice that enhances soil fertility and helps in improving soil quality. But with the commencement of more sophisticated advances in agricultural techniques, organic farming has gradually become limited in the world. Culture-dependent plant growth-promoting bacterial isolates were isolated from the bulk and rhizospheric soil, of the native high yielding pole type organic pea (Pisum sativum L.) cultivar Dentami of Dentam, West Sikkim, India. Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequencing identification of these isolates, it was found that from the bulk soil, Actinobacteria (58%) was the dominant phyla followed by Firmicutes (28%), and Proteobacteria (14%). In the rhizospheric soil it was dominated by Proteobacteria (56%), followed by Firmicutes (33%), and Bacteriodetes (11%). A total of 40 bacterial isolates were initially screened for the plant growth-promoting (PGP) activity and out of them only four bacterial isolates i.e., Bacillus cereus P8, Arthrobacter woluwensis DP2, Paenarthrobacter nitroguajacolicus PP3, and Bacillus mycoides PP10 with accession numbers MN589697, MN559516, MN519462 and MN589696 respectively were found to possess higher PGP activity (i.e. phosphorous, potassium solubilization and nitrogen-fixing activity) as compared to the other bacteria present in the soil. Based on the indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) quantitative assay and siderophore production assay, it was found that Bacillus cereus (MN589697) produced the highest IAA (65.5 mu g mL 1) and siderophore (71%) when compared with the other isolates. The statistical correlation suggests that pH and available phosphorus were the strongest influencing factors for the distribution of Proteobacteria in the rhizospheric soil. The results indicate that these isolates can be potential plant growth promoter under the agroclimatic conditions of Sikkim, India. To the best of our knowledge the present study is the first report of its kind and showcases significant findings pertaining to the assessment of diversity, isolation and identification of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria of organic pea grown in Sikkim.

AB  - In order to explore the influence of anthropogenic land use on the climate system during the last millennium, a set of experiments is performed with an Earth system model of intermediate complexity-the McGill Paleoclimate Model ( MPM-2). The present paper mainly focuses on biogeophysical effects of historical land cover changes. A dynamic scenario of deforestation is described based on changes in cropland fraction ( RF99). The model simulates a decrease in global mean annual temperature in the range of 0.09-0.16 degrees C, especially 0.14-0.22 degrees C in Northern Hemisphere during the last 300 years. The responses of climate system to GHGs concentration changes are also calculated for comparisons. Now, afforestation is becoming an important choice for the enhancement of terrestrial carbon sequestration and adjustment of regional climate. The results indicate that biogeophysical effects of land cover changes cannot be neglected in the assessments of climate change.

AB  - Little is known about temporal changes in the diversity and species composition of deep-sea metazoan meiofauna and their relationships with changes in the food supply. Those changes were studied for benthic copepod assemblages based on 2-year time-series data at a bathyal site in Sagami Bay (1430 m depth), central Japan, where annual fluctuation in the abundance of benthic foraminiferans was previously observed. Species diversity of benthic copepods at the site was as high as, or slightly higher than, that observed at other deep-sea sites, but did not fluctuate temporally through the study period. Multivariate analyses did not reveal any clear seasonal or directional change occurring over the longer term in their species composition, although there was some consistent pattern. These results indicate a lack of, or only weak, seasonality in the diversity and species structure of the deep-sea benthic copepod assemblages, even though the fresh organic food supply fluctuates seasonally. They also suggest that there are differences between copepods and foraminiferans in the response to changes in environmental factors, and that spatial differences in the composition of copepod communities are greater than temporal ones at this deep-sea site.

AB  - Argopecten purpuratus was exposed to two different diets which reflected short term variations in quantity and quality of the natural food supply typical in bays of southern Chile. No significant differences of clearance rate were observed over different time periods at either of two food concentrations. The scallop reduced its clearance rate significantly when it was exposed to the higher food concentration. Pseudofaeces production Occurred only at this high diet and the time factor had no significant effect on this process. The organic content of pseudofaeces was significantly lower than the organic content of the food, suggesting a pre-ingestive selection mechanism. Based on this capacity for particle selection, A. purpuratus was able to compensate for the differences in food quality of the experimental diets and ingesting particulate material containing, 38% organic matter as a result of the selection process when fed at the higher food concentration. Absorption efficiency was lower following exposure to the high food concentration, suggesting that the experimental time of 72 h was not sufficient to acclimate the digestive response to a food supply significantly different front that of its habitat of origin. Phytoplankton form the principal nutritional source for this epibenthic species, and resuspended detritus, although occurring in large quantities, may only be of importance once digestive processes become acclimated to processing them.

AB  - Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) is a global climate change mitigation strategy. Under the proposed REDD+ framework, financial incentives are provided, primarily to developing countries, for forest conservation to reduce carbon emissions. Projects labelled as REDD are being implemented in a wide variety of settings in different countries. Developing an effective benefit distribution mechanism between implementing agencies and local communities is a key challenge for the implementation of REDD+. We examined whether the REDD+ payment mechanism adopted in a REDD+ pilot project in Nepal is beneficial to the local forest users. We estimated economic contribution of the REDD+ payments to the total household income, calculated the role of payment in reducing income inequality at the household level and examined socio-economic heterogeneity represented by wealth and ethnicity among the payment recipient households. REDD+ payment provided economic benefits to the poorest households but the economic contribution of the payment to the household economy is very nominal and is insufficient to invest in livelihood enhancement activities. REDD+ payment to some extent helps to reduce income inequality among the households. Social heterogeneity of a household overshadowed household wealth status during the payment distribution among the sampled households creating social tension. Therefore, either alternative payment models or investment in community projects might yield better outcomes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Growth-defence balance is the selective partitioning of resources between biomass accumulation and defence responses. Although it is generally postulated that reallocation of limited carbon pools drives the antagonism between growth and defence, little is known about the mechanisms underlying this regulation. Jasmonates (JAs) are a group of oxylipins that are required for a broad range of responses from defence against insects to reproductive growth. Application of JAs to seedlings also leads to inhibited growth and repression of photosynthesis, suggesting a role for JAs in regulating growth-defence balance. The majority of JA research uses dicot models such as Arabidopsis and tomato, while understanding of JA biology in monocot grasses, which comprise most bioenergy feedstocks, food for human consumption, and animal feed, is limited. Interestingly, JA mutants of grasses exhibit unique phenotypes compared with well-studied dicot models. Gene expression analyses in bioenergy grasses also suggest roles for JA in rhizome development, which has not been demonstrated in Arabidopsis. In this review we summarize current knowledge of JA biology in panicoid grasses-the group that consists of the world's emerging bioenergy grasses such as switch-grass, sugarcane, Miscanthus, and sorghum. We discuss outstanding questions regarding the role of JAs in panicoid grasses, and highlight the importance of utilizing emerging grass models for molecular studies to provide a basis for engineering bioenergy grasses that can maximize biomass accumulation while efficiently defending against stress.

AB  - Silicon (Si) not only plays an important role in plant growth but also contributes significantly to the long-term terrestrial carbon sink in the form of phytoliths. This study investigated Si content of 184 plant species in meadow steppe and typical steppe of northern China to examine the influential factors of Si distribution and evaluate the potential phytolith carbon sequestration of these grasslands. Our results indicated that the average Si content generally decreased in the following order of Equisetopsida > Monocotyledoneae > Dicotyledoneae. Within angiosperms, although most Si accumulator plants were commelinid monocots, many eudicots also accumulated abundant Si in their above-ground tissues. The Si content of plant above-ground parts in typical steppe (6.53 +/- 2.88 g/kg) was significantly higher than that in meadow steppe (2.15 +/- 0.92 g/kg). The estimated phytolith-occluded carbon (PhytOC) production flux in typical steppe (0.81 +/- 0.36 kg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1)) was higher than that in meadow steppe (0.54 +/- 0.23 kg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1)). This study demonstrates that plant phylogeny influences the Si content of individual species, whereas grassland type with different mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature may significantly affect the abundance of high Si species. We conclude that increasing the abundance of grass species with high Si content in meadow steppe and appropriate grazing and fertilizer application in typical steppe will enhance the phytolith carbon sequestration in grasslands of northern China.

AB  - In vitro experiments in bioelectromagnetics frequently require the determination of specific absorption rate (SAR) within a layer of cells on the bottom of a culture flask when the SAR has rapid spatial variation both horizontally within the cell layer and vertically in the medium bathing the cells. This problem has only recently been treated in the literature; and it is here approached differently for another irradiation system. It is shown that a simple two-dimensional frequency-domain guided-wave treatment yields results qualitatively comparable to those of more computationally intensive three-dimensional time-domain free-field scattering treatments. The problem of inferring local SARs from temperature-vs.-time curves is shown to be seriously confounded by thermal diffusion; and specific analytic and numerical results are presented to aid in understanding this effect. A novel experimental technique is introduced for measuring millikelvin temperature offsets with subsecond resolution, and illustrative experimental data are presented. Finally, present experimental and theoretical uncertainties are considered; and it is pessimistically asserted that, in a culture flask where spatial SAR variation is rapid, point SAR measurements by thermal methods may be in error by as much as +/-3 dB. More reliable thermal determinations will require extreme care, challenging technological innovations, or both. Bioelectromagnetics 20:183-193, 1999. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Nowadays, geometallurgical modeling, as a rapidly growing discipline in mining engineering, has significant role in mine designing/planning especially for porphyry copper projects. In porphyry copper deposits, the copper ore often is composed of two main parts including oxide and sulfide ores. The oxide rock type consists a fraction of total copper which would be recovered by heap leaching. Flotation plant is used when the fraction of sulfide ore is high enough. The mineralogical inequality constraint linking both grade variables (total copper and oxide copper) is a difficulty which often complicates the joint modeling and simulation of variables. To simplify such complicated joint simulation, the stepwise conditional transformation technique is presented which transforms multiple variables to the univariate and multivariate Gaussian with no cross correlation. This makes it easy to simulate multiple variables with arbitrarily complex relationships. This study addresses the application of stepwise conditional transformation and sequential Gaussian simulation for reproduction of the total and oxide copper in different rock types of the Sungun porphyry copper deposit honoring the relationship between Cu-oxide and Cu-total of the initial data. Validation results show that the simulation model has a good agreement with the sample data and geological facts of deposit.

AB  - The issues like traffic congestion, parking space and vehicular emission can be reduced by adopting electric narrow tilting three-wheelers, which can also provide a cost-effective and safe mode of transport for low-income people. According to energy technology perspectives 2017, well-to-wheel global greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced up to 1.3 GtCO(2)-eq by 2060 by adopting electric mobility. This study presents a new and modified SDTC strategy and performance parameters that takes Road Bank Angle (RBA) into account so as to exhibit the adverse effects on rollover safety, ride comfort in terms of the perceived lateral acceleration and desired trajectory. Besides, this study identifies the importance of the RBA consideration in active tilt controlled vehicle for the scenario of parking on sloped surface. Simple electronic control architecture of the SDTC approach with real-time RBA consideration is proposed to address the limitations of SDTC and its supplementary advantages. This study evaluates the scenario of constant turn manoeuvre and vehicle parking on the banked roads. A multi-body model is used to capture the dynamic characteristics of the vehicle, whereas a characteristic of the Tilt Actuation System (TAS) and Active Steering (AS) system is incorporated in the form of a Transfer Function (TF) estimated using a system identification approach. The results indicate that the inclusion of a real-time RBA in the SDTC enables it to maintain steady-state torque and perceived lateral acceleration close to zero with the proposed controlled strategy, and it also keeps the vehicle upright on the sloped surface. It may be concluded that RBA compensation improves the ease of handling the vehicle while parking or riding on a sloped surface without significant control system alterations, which also makes it a viable alternative for physically disabled people.

AB  - Job analysis sits at the heart of all human resource practices, making it a critically important management activity in every organization. However, with increasing competition, shorter product life-cycles, rapid technological innovations, and the changing nature of organizational structures, its underlying assumptions are becoming increasingly questionable in today's dynamic work environment. Moreover, the methods used by traditional job analysis are simply not applicable to many new and emerging jobs and some authors feel it may even be an obstacle to organizational success. This has led to calls for a more proactive and strategic approach to job analysis so that the procedures will continue to be relevant. In this article, I emphasize the need for a strategic approach to job analysis, present a strategic job analysis framework, and discuss implications for organizations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Sugarcane is a crop of economic importance providing sugar and bioenergy resource which has a substantial contribution to the national GDP of India as well as other countries. Genomes of the several grasses have co-evolved which share large-scale synteny and genome collinearity; hence it is possible to employ EST-SSR markers of one grass species for genetic study of other related species. A set of sixty potentially informative EST-derived microsatellite (SSR) markers were employed to examine their cross-taxa transferability across the limit of taxonomic boundaries of different grass genomes. The high (96.6%) rate of SSRs cross-transferability observed in genus Saccharum followed by Erianthus (93.3%), Narenga (88.3%), Sclerostachya (86.3%), and Miscanthus (83.3%). Relatively lower rates of cross amplification were observed in other cereal crops including Sorghum bicolor, Pennisetum glaucum, Zea mays, Triticum aestivum, Oryza sativa, and Avena sativa. Cross-transferable EST-SSR markers were utilized to evaluate phylogenetic relationships among genus Saccharum, closely related genera of Saccharum complex, and other allied cereal grasses. The polymorphic information content values ranged from 0.35 to 0.95, with an average of 0.71. Such a high rates of cross-taxa transferability of the EST-SSRs make them a potent tool for genetic studies and comparative genomics across wide evolutionary distances within and across genera along with technologically simplicity and cost effectiveness. EST-SSRs will facilitate to devise potent tools for genetic improvement through advance molecular breeding of such crops for high grain productivity and better quality. They will especially be useful for the orphan grass species, which contribute a major part of the global food security.

AB  - Rainforest conversion into rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations (RP) alters global carbon cycling and contributes to climate change. However, the impact of this widespread tropical land use change on various elements of the carbon cycle is poorly understood. Here, we aimed to investigate the impact of rainforest conversion into RP on soil-dissolved organic carbon (DOC), one of the most mobile organic matter (OM) in the terrestrial ecosystem that causes the transformation and migration of C. We also explored the underlying edaphic factors regulating soil DOC changes. Our study sites were rubber monoculture, mixed-rubber plantations (H. brasiliensis, Ficus langkokensis, and Actinodaphne henryi), and a reference rainforest. We found that soil DOC concentration was 150-200% higher in RP than in rainforests, with an unchanged pattern across the seasons (dry and rainy) and plantation type. These results were concomitant with degradation in main soil properties, markedly including lower pH, electrical conductivity, SOC, available nitrogen, available phosphorus, total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP), following the RP establishment and explicitly having a significant negative correlation with DOC. Our fitted structure equation model (SEM) highlights that RP caused accelerated DOC production and a higher DOC/DN ratio by decreasing SOC (38.5%) and nutrients (TN and TP). Further, the SEM revealed a significant negative correlation between microbial biomass C (MBC) and N (MBN) and the DOC/DN ratio, implying limited microbial degradation of DOC under RP. This is further supported by our findings of 81.1% lower MBC per unit DOC and 37.1% lower MBN per unit DN under RP compared to rainforests, indicating poor transformation of DOC to microbial biomass under RP. Collectively, our findings suggest that RP with high nutrient demands and altered soil properties lead to increased leaching of DOC due to its limited utilization by microbes. These findings underscore the importance of robust and sustainable soil management (such as optimizing plant density and legume intercropping) in RP to improve soil health and minimize DOC leaching and its potential environmental consequences.

AB  - Currently, gender mainstreaming is presented as bringing new elan to gender equality policies. Gender mainstreaming is a gender equality strategy that aims to transform organizational processes and practices by eliminating gender biases in existing routines, involving the regular actors in this transformation process. In this article, we question the aspirations of gender mainstreaming. Can gender mainstreaming escape the genderedness of organizations; can it genuinely effect change, or does it inevitably become compromised? Our analysis of a case project within Human Resource Management in the Ministry of the Flemish Community in Belgium shows that gender mainstreaming does indeed bring about changes, but that it does not break down the genderedness of organizations substantially. While gender mainstreaming invokes an image of cooperation between equal parties that pursue a dual agenda of business needs and feminist goals, our analysis shows that crucial power differences between those parties determine the outcome. The complex social dynamics of gender mainstreaming entail compromises in the context of these power differences, which seriously hinder the transformative and innovative potential of gender mainstreaming.

AB  - Different environments are expected to exert differential selective pressures, often generating distinct sets of traits in organisms inhabiting different geographic regions. Starvation endurance is an important trait for organisms in harsh (i.e., extreme climate and/or biotically poor) and unpredictable environments. This is especially true for sit-and-wait predators, such as antlions, which experience stronger fluctuations in prey arrivals than do actively searching predators. We conducted an experimental comparison of starvation endurance in pit-building antlions, originating from semi-arid and hyper-arid environments. We hypothesized that individuals from the climatically harsher and biotically poor environment (i.e., hyper-arid) should be better adapted to endure long starvation periods. Additionally, we posited that faster-growing individuals are expected to be more sensitive to starvation because of their need to sustain higher metabolic rates. We found that antlions originating from the semi-arid region maintained higher activity levels, which led to slightly higher mass loss rates during starvation, but enabled faster recovery when food supply was renewed. Conversely, antlions originating from the hyper-arid region had lower activity levels, consistent with their lower rate of mass loss during starvation, but this came at the expense of decreased response to prey and lower growth rate when food became available again. Each strategy holds its advantages for coping with long starvation periods, and we cannot say decisively which strategy is better. Results from both regions were consistent with the predictions of the growth compensation phenomenon: antlions that were fed less frequently pre-starvation grew at faster rates when food supply was renewed. Our study demonstrates that individuals originating from different environments adopt different strategies in order to endure starvation, exemplifying antlions' ability to compensate for mass lost during starvation.

AB  - The objective of this work is to deepen the analysis of the socioeconomic determinants of mental health, paying special attention to the impact of inequality, not only in income distribution but also in gender, racial, health and education inequality, social isolation, including new variables to measure loneliness, and healthy habits, on the mental health status. For this purpose, a cross-sectional model for a sample of 2735 counties in the United States is estimated using Ordinary Least Squares in its robust version to solve the detected heteroscedasticity problems. The results obtained show that inequality, social isolation and certain lifestyles, such as smoking or insomnia, are detrimental to mental health, while sexual activity prevents mental distress. On the other hand, poor counties suffer more cases of suicide, with food insecurity being the main problem for mental health. Finally, we found detrimental effects of pollution on mental health.

AB  - In addition to the public health crisis visited upon the world, the COVID-19 pandemic has created unique uncertainties for organisations engaged with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), spanning a range of matters, such as maintaining operational momentum, financial sustainability, achieving policy influence, and engaging in strategic communications. In this article, we focus on organisations engaged in the fight against modern slavery, a significant part of Sustainable Development Goal 8, which seeks to 'promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all' with a particular focus on the call for states to '[t]ake immediate and effective measures to horizontal ellipsis end modern slavery' (SDG 8.7). Our analysis highlights the importance of 'social listening' during the temporal and spatial progression of COVID-19 to: (a) facilitate the identification of agenda proxies reflected in strategic communications used by anti-slavery organisations, and (b) to provide insights into changing communication tactics deployed by these organisations in the context of mass-communication using social media as a result of the global pandemic.

AB  - Natural disasters can cause abrupt disturbances in coastal wetlands, affecting the social perception of ecosystem services (ES). The Tubul-Raqui coastal wetland is one of the most important wetlands in south-central Chile. Rich in biodiversity, these wetlands provide ES to a population of 2238 inhabitants. The recent M-W = 8.8 earthquake of 2010 caused a coastal uplift of 1.4 m and substantial morphological, social, and environmental changes. This paper analyzes the social perceptions of the inhabitants of the village of Tubul-Raqui following a large earthquake disturbance with regards to ES provision frequency and their future changes. A statistically representative semi-structured survey was conducted (175 valid surveys) and the data interpreted through factor analysis and statistical tests for independent categorical variables. The perception of cultural and regulating services was significantly greater than that of provisioning services, which were probably the most affected by the earthquake. Residents identified habitat for species, recreation, and hazard regulation as the most important ES. Perception was influenced by the categorical variables of gender, age, and ethnicity; for example, hazard regulation services varied strongly by gender. According to the respondents, the availability of ES will remain stable (50%) or decrease (40%) in the next 50 years, mainly due to anthropogenic drivers; the effect of natural disasters was not mentioned among the main drivers of change.

AB  - The number of organisations putting the issue of sustainability on strategic agenda has been growing in the past few years. Although sustainable development gains more importance, discussion on measures of sustainability is continuing. Environmental and economic dimensions could be more easily evaluated by clearly expressed quantitative indicators. Social sustainability measurement requires a balance between quantitative and qualitative indicators, Furthermore, there is still some ambiguity around what social sustainability actually is. It seems that essentially the determinants of the "social" element depend on the underlying framework. However, the majority of the existing measurement frameworks do not fully address the employee perspective. To bridge this gap, the present study aims at substantiating the framework for measuring social sustainability from the employee perspective. The scientific value of the study is the contribution to social sustainability measurement literature by identifying the employee perspective. The proposed framework for social sustainability measurement incudes six dimensions: employee participation, employee cooperation, equal opportunities, employee development, health and safety, and external partnership. For reaching the aim of the paper, two methods are applied: interview of line managers and employee survey. The study is conducted in a CSR-committed organisation, which is a member of the Lithuanian Association of Responsible Business. The findings reveal some differences in the attitudes of employees concerning the social sustainability practices. Health and safety conditions were disclosed as the most important in terms of social sustainability. The findings also suggest incorporating the perspective of employees when measuring social sustainability. The study shows vital involvement of employees in social sustainability evaluation of an organisation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article addresses certain gaps highlighted in the literature relating to the investigation of supplier selection through a theoretical lens, based on contextual factors, institutional pressure, and industrial features. Consequently, this article sheds light on how a government's strategic plans can drive organisations to incorporate elements of social sustainability into their supply chains. A successful case from Oman which demonstrates the social dimension of sustainability in selecting suppliers in the oil and gas sector is presented, along with the government's role and the mechanisms it has applied. A survey of purchasing, procurement and supply chain managers in Oman's major oil and gas organisations was conducted, along with interviews. The results of this research were further analysed through the lens of institutional theory, addressing a genuine research gap. It was found that: (a) coercive governmental pressure is not sufficient to truly develop socially sustainable practices in organisations if the organisations themselves do not show initiative, as this leads to compliant rather than innovative practice; and (b) policy makers need to be aware that coercive pressure alone does not lead to continuous improvement of social sustainability performance, due to the ceiling effect, i.e. organisations meeting only the minimum governmental requirements.

AB  - Third places are a successful example of public places, which, due to their special characteristics, play an important role in enhancing the social sustainability of cities. Sustainable social development is a significant issue for the metropolis of Isfahan as this city today is facing serious challenges such as inequality and conflict in maintaining and increasing the life quality of its citizens. This research aims to explore the role of third places in promoting social sustainability in the urban districts of the city of Isfahan and to discover their significant dimensions and components. The current applied research employed a library based descriptive-analytic approach together with a field study method. Urban experts and managers comprised the statistical population of whom 25 individuals were selected to form the sample. DEMATEL method was used to discover the trend of classification patterns of sustainability components and the role of third places. The results of the cause and effect analysis through DEMATEL show that dynamism and vitality, and flexibility are the main and the most influential factors in increasing the social sustainability in Isfahan. The results also highlight the impact of combined components and indicators of the third place with different dimensions of social sustainability, especially in the urban districts in Isfahan.

AB  - Biojet fuel, also known as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), is the only viable carbon neutral option for the aviation sector to become net zero by 2050 as of now considering the progress, development, and success of all the decarbonization routes. Environmental Life Cycle Assessment (ELCA) studies have also supported the fact that biojet fuel is superior over fossil jet fuel in mitigating climate change and protecting certain elements of the ecosphere. However, social sustainability of biojet fuel, characterized by elements and indicators like gender and social equity, food security, health & safety, employment, community engagement, organizational behavior & values, are hardly researched by the scientific community in adequate amount. This paper synthesized a detailed summary of the above-mentioned social sustainability elements and indicators, by reviewing a wide range of literature on social sustainability of bioenergy. The study found that commercialization of socially sustainable biojet fuel is achievable in very near future, however, integration and cooperation of all stakeholders and social stages at local, national, and international levels are aggressively required to achieve this goal. The study also recommends use of Social Life Cycle Assessment (SLCA) tool to further strengthen R&D and economic policy support for biojet fuel for net zero aviation by 2050.

AB  - In spite of fast growth and increasing average income levels, China's development has been uneven across various sectors and regions. This uneven development has reduced the life satisfaction of many people and has caused social tensions. Using four rounds of the Chinese Household Income Project data, this paper investigates social tensions caused by inequality, poverty and polarization across rural and urban areas, and across the Eastern, Central and Western regions, and between the emerging super provinces/megacities and the rest. It shows that although tensions have been significantly alleviated by fast economic growth, the impact of growth imbalances is still very severe. China should focus on more balanced growth in addition to a high rate of growth.

AB  - Many ecosystems continue to experience rapid transformations due to processes like land use change and resource extraction. A systems approach to maintaining natural resources focuses on how interactions and feedbacks among components of complex social-ecological systems generate social and ecological outcomes. In recreational fisheries, residential shoreline development and fish stocking are two widespread human behaviors that influence fisheries, yet emergent social-ecological outcomes from these potentially interacting behaviors remain under explored. We applied a social-ecological systems framework using a simulation model and empirical data to determine whether lakeshore development is likely to promote stocking through its adverse effects on coarse woody habitat and thereby also on survival of juvenile and adult fish. We demonstrate that high lakeshore development is likely to generate dependency of the ecosystem on the social system, in the form of stocking. Further, lakeshore development can interact with social-ecological processes to create deficits for state-level governments, which threatens the ability to fund further ecosystem subsidies. Our results highlight the value of a social-ecological framework for maintaining ecosystem services like recreational fisheries.

AB  - The developmental triangle earlier comprises economic growth, income inequality, and poverty, while in this study, we extended it by incorporating environmental and resource factors, health and education factors, sectoral value added, and some other growth-specific factors for assessing pro-poor growth, by considering Bolivian economy as a case study. The elasticity estimates show that agriculture and industrial sector growth is not pro-poor due to account of high income inequality, while services sector played a vital role in country's economic development and supports poor livelihood in a country. Energy and environmental resources negatively impact on quality of life of the poor relative to non-poor, which create income differences among them. Health and education expenditures give favors to the poor and supported the notion of pro-poor growth, while country's per capita income and foreign direct investment inflows increase income inequality that lead towards pro-rich growth. The results conclude that, in general, Bolivian economy growth is fairly unstable, polluted, and unhealthy that biased to the poor relative to non-poor.

AB  - Background: Investigations into socioeconomic inequalities in mortality have rarely used long-term mortality follow-up data from nationally representative samples in Asian countries. A limited subset of indicators for socioeconomic position was employed in prior studies on socioeconomic inequalities in mortality. We examined socioeconomic inequalities in mortality using follow-up 12-year mortality data from nationally representative samples of South Koreans. Methods: A total of 10,137 individuals who took part in the 1998 and 2001 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys were linked to mortality data from Statistics Korea. Of those individuals, 1,219 (12.1 %) had died as of December 2012. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the relative risks of mortality according to a wide range of socioeconomic position (SEP) indicators after taking into account primary sampling units, stratification, and sample weights. Results: Our analysis showed strong evidence that individuals with disadvantaged SEP indicators had greater all-cause mortality risks than their counterparts. The magnitude of the association varied according to gender, age group, and specific SEP indicators. Cause-specific analyses using equivalized income quintiles showed that the magnitude of mortality inequalities tended to be greater for cardiovascular disease and external causes than for cancer. Conclusion: Inequalities in mortality exist in every aspect of SEP indicators, both genders, and age groups, and four broad causes of deaths. The South Korean economic development, previously described as effective in both economic growth and relatively equitable income distribution, should be scrutinized regarding its impact on socioeconomic mortality inequalities. Policy measures to reduce inequalities in mortality should be implemented in South Korea.

AB  - Biomass energy is projected to be a critical resource for defossilization of the energy system. While urban area extension and land conservation would constrain potential biomass supply, there is little understanding of their impacts. This paper presents global and regional bioenergy supply potential estimates by newly implementing urban area expansion in an integrated assessment model AIM (Asia-Pacific Integrated Model). Scenarios were investigated as combinations of shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) with default and expanded urban area and conservation. The bioenergy potentials in 2050 with fixed urban area at base year level were in the range of 228 (SSP3) to 292 (SSP1) exajoules per year (EJ yr-1), corresponding to differences in fraction of land available for bioenergy crop production. The bioenergy potentials under urban expansion closely tracked trends in the reference SSP cases, but with decreases ranging from 4.48 (SSP1) to 6.95 (SSP5) EJ yr-1. While global total effects were small, regions experienced mixed results and in some cases a reversal of trends. Under conservation scenarios, reductions in bioenergy potential caused by urban expansion were observed to be lower except in some regions and scenarios. These results enhance the understanding of SSP patterns of bioenergy potential while at the same time revealing how global trends may fail to capture region-specific trends. The study concluded that: 1) urbanization may lack relevance for bioenergy at the global scale but becomes important for some regions, 2) loss of bioenergy potential can be curbed by encouraging compact urbanization as in SSP1 (Sustainable Development), zoning, and pursuing joint energy-conservation policies.

AB  - Sustainable agricultural management is needed to promote carbon (C) sequestration in soil, prevent loss of soil fertility, and reduce the release of greenhouse gases. However, the influence of agronomic practices on soil C sequestration depends on the existing pedoclimatic features. We characterized the soils of three farms far away each other in the Emilia-Romagna region (Northern Italy): an organic farm in the Northern Apennines, a biodynamic farm, and a conventional farm on the Po Plain. The total, inorganic, and organic carbon in soil, as well as the distinct humic fractions were investigated, analyzing both the elemental and isotopic (C-13/C-12) composition. In soils, organic matter appears to be variously affected by mineralization processes induced by microorganisms that consume organic carbon. In particular, organic carbon declined in farms located in the plain (e.g., organic carbon down to 0.75 wt%; carbon stock(0-30 cm) down to 33 Mg/ha), because of the warmer climate and moderately alkaline environment that enhance soil microbial activity. On the other hand, at the mountain farm, the minimum soil disturbance, the cold climate, and the neutral conditions favored soil C sequestration (organic carbon up to 4.42 wt%; carbon stock(0-30 cm) up to 160 Mg/ha) in humified organic compounds with long turnover, which can limit greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. This work shows the need for thorough soil investigations, to propose tailored best-practices that can reconcile productivity and soil sustainability.

AB  - Asturias (NW Spain) is regarded as an important metallogenic province with particular emphasis on mercury (Hg) and arsenic (As). Different Hg mineral species, as well as As-rich minerals, are found in the ore deposits in this part of Spain. Metallurgical activity to extract Hg from these ores was also carried out at many sites. Consequently, the combination of emissions during mining of the ore and additional releases during the inefficient roasting operation gave rise to significant releases of Hg and As to the surrounding soils. All the Hg mines of the district were abandoned before the introduction of any environmental regulations; consequently, the environment is globally affected. Mean Hg contents in soils range from 42 to 155mgkg(-1), whereas average As concentrations range from 17 to 831mgkg(-1).

AB  - Salt-tolerant Tamarix chinensis roots are crucial in preserving wetland soil and carbon sequestration, which is essential for wetland ecology. Soil-water-salt conditions influence the growth of these roots in coastal saline areas, but the specific factors and their effects remain unclear. Using principal component and partial least square-structural equation modelling (SEM) methods, we studied T. chinensis root features in six Yellow River delta communities. Results showed varied root features across locations, with larger roots further inland. Root growth negatively correlated with soil texture and salinity and positively with groundwater levels. Soil texture and salinity decreased with distance from the coast, while groundwater increased with distance from the Yellow River. This suggests that geographical location influences soil-water-salt conditions, impacting root characteristics. The principal component analysis-derived root feature index captured 56.7% of root feature variation. SEM revealed geographical locations indirectly influence root features, with the Yellow River's proximity primarily affecting them through groundwater and coastal distance influencing via soil sand content and salinity. The study underscores the importance of these findings for wetland conservation and ecology.

AB  - The impact of carbon-nitrogen dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems on the interaction between the carbon cycle and climate is studied using an earth system model of intermediate complexity, the MIT Integrated Global Systems Model (IGSM). Numerical simulations were carried out with two versions of the IGSM's Terrestrial Ecosystems Model, one with and one without carbon-nitrogen dynamics. Simulations show that consideration of carbon-nitrogen interactions not only limits the effect of CO2 fertilization but also changes the sign of the feedback between the climate and terrestrial carbon cycle. In the absence of carbon-nitrogen interactions, surface warming significantly reduces carbon sequestration in both vegetation and soil by increasing respiration and decomposition (a positive feedback). If plant carbon uptake, however, is assumed to be nitrogen limited, an increase in decomposition leads to an increase in nitrogen availability stimulating plant growth. The resulting increase in carbon uptake by vegetation exceeds carbon loss from the soil, leading to enhanced carbon sequestration (a negative feedback). Under very strong surface warming, however, terrestrial ecosystems become a carbon source whether or not carbon-nitrogen interactions are considered. Overall, for small or moderate increases in surface temperatures, consideration of carbon-nitrogen interactions result in a larger increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration in the simulations with prescribed carbon emissions. This suggests that models that ignore terrestrial carbon-nitrogen dynamics will underestimate reductions in carbon emissions required to achieve atmospheric CO2 stabilization at a given level. At the same time, compensation between climate-related changes in the terrestrial and oceanic carbon uptakes significantly reduces uncertainty in projected CO2 concentration.

AB  - Models of photosynthesis mimetic systems, the so-called artificial photosynthesis systems, have been investigated since the 1970s for the purpose of tapping solar energy. With the deterioration of the global environment in the 21st century, attributed to global warming and greenhouse gas emissions, it has become imperative to identify new fuel sources such as solar energy to replace fossil fuels. Among the new fuel production systems, those involving the use of solar energy have attracted attention; examples are systems that produce hydrogen through water photolysis and those that produce methanol by CO2 reduction with the aid of an artificial photosynthesis system. As hydrogen and methanol are low-carbon fuels (the emission of CO2 from the combustion of these fuels is low), they are considered to be alternatives to fossil resources. In this review, solar fuel production systems consisting of an artificial photosynthesis system, a catalyst, and an enzyme are discussed. These systems are expected to help in reducing CO2 and to promote the use of low-carbon fuels in the future.

AB  - Solar energy is one option for reducing future greenhouse gas emissions, Offsetting 50% of all future growth in thermal electricity generation by photovoltaics (PVs) would reduce annual global carbon dioxide emission from projected increased levels by 10% in 20 years and 32% in 50 years, Several projects are under way worldwide to demonstrate the feasibility of PV systems, This paper examines the economic competitiveness of PV systems and concludes that even after including externality costs, without significant technological breakthroughs, the economics of PV applications are unlikely to allow for an unsubsidized, widespread adoption of this technology in the near future, Further, if the goal of PV transfer programmes is to limit future greenhouse gas emissions, there are larger and cheaper opportunities available in industrialized countries to achieve reductions, Alternative measures for ensuring a market for photovoltaics, hence providing manufacturers with opportunities to improve the current technology, include mandating that utilities install a certain quantity of solar technologies by a certain date, Finally, moving towards a renewable energy future that includes PV systems requires a sustained R&D programme that will lead to improvements in panel and other system efficiencies.

The results show that economic growth has become less important in that debate than other conditioning factors over the last few years. The current pattern of education spending contributes to the maintenance of social vulnerability, thereby making it harder for individuals to participate fully in society. In contrast, increases in formal education and formalization have made opportunities less unequal.

AB  - Carbon export driven by submesoscale, eddy-associated vertical velocities ("eddy subduction"), and particularly its seasonality, remains understudied, leaving a gap in our understanding of ocean carbon sequestration. Here, we assess mechanisms controlling eddy subduction's spatial and seasonal patterns using 15 years of observations from BGC-Argo floats in the Southern Ocean. We identify signatures of eddy subduction as subsurface anomalies in temperature-salinity and oxygen. The anomalies are spatially concentrated near weakly stratified areas and regions with strong lateral buoyancy gradients diagnosed from satellite altimetry, particularly in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current's standing meanders. We use bio-optical ratios, specifically the chlorophyll a to particulate backscatter ratio (Chl/bbp) to find that eddy subduction is most active in the spring and early summer, with freshly exported material associated with seasonally weak vertical stratification and increasing surface biomass. Climate change is increasing ocean stratification globally, which may weaken eddy subduction's carbon export potential.

AB  - There are large discrepancies among estimates of the cropland area in China due to the lack of reliable data. In this study, we used Landsat TM/ ETM data at a spatial resolution of 30 in to reconstruct spatial and temporal patterns of cropland across China for the time period of 1990-2000. Our estimate has indicated that total cropland area in China in 2000 was 141.1 million hectares (ha), including 35.6 million ha paddy land and 105.5 million ha dry farming land. The distribution of cropland is uneven across the regions of China. The North-East region of China shows more cropland area per capita than the South-East and North regions of China. During 1990-2000, cropland increased by 2.79 million ha, including 0.25 million ha of paddy land and 2.53 million ha of dry farming land. The North-East and North-West regions of China gained cropland area, while the North and South-East regions showed a loss of cropland area. Urbanization accounted for more than half of the transformation from cropland to other land uses, and the increase in cropland was primarily due to reclamation of grassland and deforestation. Most of the lost cropland had good quality with high productivity, but most gained cropland was poor quality land with less suitability for crop production. The globalization as well as changing environment in China is affecting land-use change. Coordinating the conflict between environmental conservation and land demands for food will continue to be a primary challenge for China in the future. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - To effectively address the unprecedented acceleration of climate change, cities across the United States are leading efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Coherent, aggressive, and lasting mitigation policies in controlling carbon emissions are beginning to be adopted to help strengthen climate resilience across different sectors. However, evaluating the effectiveness of current climate legislation requires careful monitoring of emissions through measurable and verifiable means to inform policy decisions. As a part of this effort, we developed a new method to spatially allocate aircraft-based mass balance carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. In this work, we conducted 7 aircraft flights, performed downwind of New York City (NYC) to quantify CO2 emissions during the nongrowing seasons between 2018 and 2020. We used an ensemble of emission inventories and transport models to calculate the fraction of enhancements (F) produced by sources within the policy-relevant boundaries of the 5 NYC boroughs and then applied that to the bulk emissions calculated using the mass balance approach. We derived a campaign-averaged source-apportioned mass balance CO2 emission rate of (57 +/- 24) (1s) kmol/s for NYC. We evaluated the performance of this approach against other top-down methods for NYC including inventory scaling and inverse modeling, with our mean emissions estimate resulting in a 6.5% difference from the average emission rate reported by the 2 complementary approaches. By combining mass balance and transport model approaches, we improve upon traditional mass balance experiment methods to enable quantification of emissions in complex emission environments. We conducted an assessment using an ensemble of emission inventories and transport models to determine the sources of variability in the final calculated emission rates. Our findings indicate that the choice of inventory accounted for 2.0% of the variability in the emission estimates and that the atmospheric transport model contributed 3.9% at the campaign level. Additionally, on average, at the daily scale,the transport model contributed 7.6% and the inventory accounted for 14.1%.The daily flight-to-flight variability contributed a significant portion, at 42.1%. This approach provides a solution to the difficulty of interpreting aircraft-based mass balance results in complex emission environments.

AB  - Cultural Ecosystem Services (CES) are non-material benefits that are indispensable for the health and well-being of communities. CES are often spatially explicit and fluctuate according to the knowledge, beliefs, and perception of users of the location. Therefore, understanding the spatial patterns of CES perceived by people from different backgrounds is important for decision-makers to carry out proactive landscape planning. In this study, we investigated the differences in the perception of CES between residents and tourists on Ishigaki Island, Japan. The study employed a Public Participation Geographic Information System (PPGIS) approach to spatially present the respective perceptions of residents and tourists regarding six types of CES, namely recreational, therapeutic, educational, spiritual, aesthetic, and historic CES, that are recognized as key contributors to human health and well-being. For data collection, we employed a combination of household-level postal surveys and in-person questionnaire surveys targeting residents (n = 410) and tourists (n = 102), respectively. A series of statistical and spatial analyses was conducted on the survey results to understand the influence of the duration of residence and the frequency of visits in shaping the perceptions of CES, as well as the relationship between perceived CES and land-use types. This included the contribution of protected areas to the delivery of CES. The results showed that the average number of locations indicated by residents was significantly higher than that indicated by the tourists, resulting in density maps with distinct spatial patterns. In particular, the spatial pattern of CES identified by tourists was considerably simpler than that recognized by residents and centered on two popular tourist spots. As per the elements of landscapes and seascapes, the perception of "aesthetic," "recreational," "therapeutic," and "educational" CES by residents was associated with "forest" and "sea" and that of "spiritual" and "historic" was associated with "forest" and "farmland." In contrast, the CES perception of "recreational," "educational," "therapeutic," "aesthetic," and "historic" by tourists was associated with "sea" and "forest." "Spiritual" CES was associated with "forest" and "sea." Lastly, a higher proportion of "aesthetic" CES locations were identified within protected areas compared to outside the areas. Overall, our findings revealed that residents and tourists perceive and appreciate the numerous CES arising from landscapes and seascapes of the island differently. This indicates a possible trade-off resulting from land or sea developments to the benefit among stakeholders, for example, tourists. Hence, to sustain CES that underpin equitable health and well-being benefits, spatial planning should consider the different perceptions of stakeholders, particularly of residents and tourists, regarding CES types and locations.

AB  - To redefine the mobility and energy usage patterns in urban cities, the exponential rise in fast-charging loads of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates a new operating paradigm. In this context, a competitive market emerges where multiple oligarchic Charging-as-a-Service (CaaS) providers vie for profit. However, analyzing such systems, especially in a long-term rolling horizon, poses significant challenges due to complex strategic interactions among multiple entities. This article proposes an agent-based model to analyze the evolution of spatial CaaS markets. Firstly, we propose a strategic pricing game among CaaS firms based on multinomial logit user choice model, and formally prove the existence of Nash equilibria. For equilibrium finding, an iterative algorithm method leveraging the Nikaido-Isoda function and Barzilai-Borwein step size rule is presented. Furthermore, an agent-based market simulation algorithm is developed to model investment decisions of CaaS firm agents based on equilibrium prices. The proposed model is validated using real world data from Shenzhen, and results indicate the efficacy of the equilibrium solving algorithm in reducing computational burden. This study reveals that deregulated competition among CaaS providers, while promoting social welfare, poses risks to long-term sustainability due to regional inequality and market saturation. Timely policy intervention is recommended to guide the sustainable evolution of the CaaS economy.

AB  - The critical role of urban innovation in sustaining urban economic resilience has been widely acknowledged by scholars. Yet there is far from a full spectrum of understanding about how innovation performs, despite China's innovation outputs having far outweighed most countries'. The perennial concern regarding the spatial patterns of innovation has been biased towards the macroscale, and long-standing efforts to explore the determinants of innovative vitality are focused on internal factors (e.g., research and development activities, and firm size). Considering these inadequacies, this research investigates how innovative activities are spatially distributed and how the pattern evolves in cities at the microscale, and examines influencing factors of the external environment. The patent data from 2000 to 2015 in Shanghai are geocoded and mapped into 1 km(2) hexagon grids to identify local clustering. Gini coefficient is computed to show the high concentration of innovation activities across space. The hot spot analysis based on the Getis-Ord (G(i)*) statistic shows that innovation exhibits a strong concentration propensity at the microscale and gradually moves toward a polycentric pattern. However, the extent of concentration decreases over the study period. Firms dictate innovation activities, and individuals and universities also play a role in downtown innovation growth. The regression using random effect model shows heterogeneous effects on different innovation actors. The overall urban innovation output, dominated by firms, is significantly influenced by public budget expenditures and green space areas. The science and technology grant has a positive impact on authorities but not university and research institutes. This research not only contributes to a methodological innovation for measuring and visualizing an innovation pattern but also enriches our understanding of spatial evolution and critical factors of innovation activities in urban China.

AB  - The rapid socioeconomic development leads to the deterioration of ecological environment. Ecosystem assessment has been conducted worldwide, e.g. the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment to assess consequences of ecosystem change for human well-being. To enhance ecosystem assessment in China, this study proposes the design of a monitoring network for the terrestrial ecosystem consisting of core stations and localized points. With focus on ecosystem services of NPP, water conservation, soil retention and sandstorm prevention, core stations of the monitoring network for observ-ing all four services are first selected by assessing and improving spatial representativeness in ecoregions of forest, grassland and desert ecosystems. Then a spatial sampling method is applied to choose localized points for observing each specific service. Eventually expert's knowledge is used to make final decisions of added stations and points by utilizing existing networks and considering factors such as topography, spatial coverage. Combining both aforementioned approaches and experts knowledge, 60 core stations and 176 localized points are finally determined for the monitoring network. For the forest ecosystem, 39 core stations are decided with 31 selected from existing networks and eight newly added core stations improve spatial representativeness by 51.58 %, 68.11 % and 75.55 % in Temper-ate grasslands, Temperate desert and Alpine vegetation in Tibet Plateau respectively. For the grassland and desert eco-system, 21 core stations are chosen with 18 from existing networks and three newly added core stations improve the representativeness by 21.60 % and 44.88 % in Tibet alpine grassland and Grassland in southern mountain areas respectively. Priorities in the implementation phase should be given to instruments installation for monitoring all four services in core stations from existing networks and setting up new stations in regions where representativeness are significantly improved.

AB  - The development of approaches to quantify and spatialize ecosystem services (ES) are greatly encouraged by the Millenium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) and the REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation). Such approaches could allow the establishment of more appropriate and effective practices and policies for environmental management. Mapping of ES can be seen as a major management tool for places with high environmental issues. A study is conducted at the scale of three areas in the Brazilian Amazon affected by the deforestation front. Two biophysical processes delivering ES, water infiltration in soil and carbon storage in vegetation, were mapped with a spatial resolution of 30 x 30 m. Statistical models were developed in aim to link field measurements of biomass and infiltration rate in 135 sampling points and remote sensing data. These models provide an estimation of the processes for the sites and able us to identify the factors that influence them. The resulting maps facilitate the understanding of the spatial distribution of these processes and can be used as a basis to map and/or study trade-offs and synergies between the ES.

AB  - Transportation is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions in cities. Multiple strategies including green technologies, transport management, urban planning and behavior changes are required to mitigate transport emissions. This paper aims to introduce an analytical framework to investigate the impacts of different spatial-modal strategies on reducing commuting emissions. Based on the optimization approach of excess commuting, the proposed framework incorporates the minimum, maximum and random (unpredictable) travel outcomes to inform planning of an urban form embedded with fewer emissions. This analytical framework is applied to Hong Kong to estimate the emissions ranges (the minimum and maximum amounts) under 42 spatial-modal scenarios - a combination of six spatial strategies (status quo, monocentric, highly polycentric, moderately polycentric, dual-centric and tri-centric) and seven modal strategies (status quo, pro-rail (high), pro-rail (moderate), pro bus (high), pro-bus (moderate), pro-car (high) and pro-car (moderate)). The findings illustrate the emissions impacts if Hong Kong is further developed following a job concentration or decentralization principle. It also indicates that if Hong Kong is reconstructed to be a city with multiple CBDs, a dual-centric strategy is desirable because both minimum and maximum commuting are shorter than that of a tri-centric strategy. Moreover, the modal strategy to actively promote rail usage shows more impacts on emissions reduction and car usage should be maintained at the current level. If commuter's travl is less predictable, the high rail usage under a dual-centric city form is a more sustainable spatial-modal strategy. The proposed analytical framework of city's commuting emissions affected by structural and modal changes is transferrable to other places and could offer planners different benchmarks of travel pattern to substantiate their sustainable city planning vision.

AB  - With rapid urbanization in China, the dramatic land-use changes are one of the most prominent features that have substantially affected the land ecosystems, thus seriously threatening sustainable development. However, current studies have focused more on evaluating the economic efficiency of land-use, while the loss and degradation of ecosystem services are barely considered. To address these issues, this study first proposed a land use-based input-output index system, incorporating the impact on ecosystem services value (ESV), and then by taking 30 provinces in China as a case study. We further employed the super-efficiency slacks-based model (Super-SBM) and the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology (STIRPAT) model to explore the spatial-temporal changes and driving factors of the evaluated land-use eco-efficiency. We found that the evaluated ESV was 28.09 trillion yuan (at the price of 2000) in 2015, and that the total ESV experienced an inverted U-shaped trend during 2000-2015.The average land-use eco-efficiency exhibited a downward trend from 0.87 in 2000 to 0.68 in 2015 with distinct regional differences by taking into account the ESV. Our results revealed that northeastern region had the highest efficiency, followed by the eastern, western, and central region of China. Finally, we identified a U-shaped relationship between the eco-efficiency and land urbanization, and found that technological innovation made great contributions to the improvement of the eco-efficiency. These findings highlight the importance of the ESV in the evaluation of land-use eco-efficiency. Future land development and management should pay additional attention to the land ecosystems, especially the continuous supply of human well-being related ecosystem services.

AB  - Spatio-temporal change characteristic in leaf area index (LAI), gross primary productivity (GPP), total leaf area and total carbon sequestration of terrestrial vegetation at different geographic regions, provinces and land cover change types over China during 2000-2018 were clarified, respectively. The net increase in total leaf area and carbon sequestration over China from 2000 to 2018 is 1.7491 x 10(6) km(2) and 1957.36 TgC, and Southwestern part contributes the most with a contribution of 25.3% for leaf area and 20.1% for carbon sequestration, respectively. The overall contribution of northern provinces to enhanced carbon sequestration capacity is greater than that of southern provinces, with a maximum for Inner Mongolia, even though southern provinces have a much higher leaf area increase. The annual increase rates of LAI and GPP in returning cropland to forest-grassland and artificial restoration of forest-grassland are higher than that of self-rehabilitation of rapid growth stage for planted young vegetation. However, due to self-rehabilitation of forest-grassland has the largest area percentage of 59%, it contributes the most to the increases of leaf area and carbon sequestration among different land cover change types, except for northeastern China, where improved farmland productivity is a dominant factor. It should be noted that the leaf area and carbon sequestration exhibit upward trends in urbanized areas over China. whereas slight increasing and even negative trends are also observed in southwestern, southern, and eastern China (e.g., Shanghai), where artificial surface construction occupied more cropland during urbanization processing. Compared with climatic factors, LAI is the dominant factor influencing GPP increases over China since 2000, and gradually weakened coupling relationship between LAI and GPP is observed from north to south. For climatic factors, GPP is dominantly affected by precipitation in northern parts and by solar radiation in southern parts.

AB  - Ecosystem service value (ESV) is a significant indicator related to regional ecological well-being. Evaluating ESV premised on continuous time series land benefit data can provide an accurate reference for regional ecological civilization construction and sustainable development. Taking Shijiazhuang, the capital city of Hebei Province as an example, the study analyzed land use changes based on the land use data of the continuous time series from 2000 to 2020 and introduced a socio-economic adjustment factor and biomass factor adjustment factor to construct a dynamic assessment model of ecosystem service value. The spatiotemporal changes of the ecosystem service value in Shijiazhuang City were evaluated, and the dynamic prediction of the ecosystem service value was made using the CLUE-S model and the GM (1,1) model. (1) The changes in the overall ESV and spatial pattern in Shijiazhuang are strongly linked to the change in land use, and the contribution of cultivated land, woodland, and grassland to ecosystem service value exceeds 90%. (2) Between 2000 and 2020, the value of ecosystem services illustrated a dynamic change and gradually declined, with the total amount falling from 28.003 to 19.513 billion yuan. Among individual ecosystem services, the value of regulation services suffered the most serious loss. (3) CLUE-S and GM (1,1) perform well in the prediction of ESV. The prediction outcomes illustrate that the ecosystem service value of Shijiazhuang will continue to decline by 2025, and the ecosystem value will drop to 16.771 billion yuan. This research may offer a reference for the dynamic assessment of ESV of the continuous sequence and help to promote regional ecological protection and sustainable development.

AB  - Sustainable land use, targeted poverty alleviation (TPA) and integrated urban/town development are key issues for the poverty-stricken counties of China. This paper explored the spatio-temporal pattern and driving forces of construction land change in Longzhou, a typical poverty-stricken border county in southwest China, based on high-resolution remote sensing images and field investigations. The results showed that, from 2011 to 2016, the construction land in Longzhou increased by 10.08%. The largest increase shown by urban built-up areas (37.74%) followed by rural residential (25.48%), industrial and mining (20.96%), and transportation areas (15.49%) as well by tourist facility areas (0.33%). The accelerated urban development, rural housing construction, and construction of industrial parks and transportation facilities are main factors driving construction land expansion, while the implementation of TPA strategy and the booming of border trade activities are important policy drivers of the construction land expansion. Some of the major implications for improving povertyalleviation-oriented land use policies were further discussed. The authors argue that land use policy innovation could play a key role in breaking the Matthew effect (poor get poorer, rich get richer) of China's uneven regional development and generating and accelerating the transformation development of poverty-stricken counties. It is fundamental to meet the demand of construction land for TPA, meanwhile raise the intensive level of land utilization. The authors suggest that the government need to further improve and implement preferential land use policies for poverty-stricken counties from the provincial level, appropriately increase the quotas of construction land, and effectively strengthen the rational, efficient and intensive use of the quotas of construction land, and provide solid land policy support for poverty alleviation and thus achieve the Sustainable Development Goals with higher quality.

AB  - This article utilizes the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) methodology to evaluate the influence of green financing on sustainable energy practices in India's tourism industry from 2000 to 2022. The findings suggest that the issue of green bonds has a substantial and favorable impact on the long-term environmental sustainability of the business, albeit the immediate consequences are negligible. Furthermore, the consumer price index has a negative impact on environmental sustainability, both in the short and long term. To promote sustainable practices, suggested policy solutions encompass increased regulatory supervision, transparent distribution of market data, implementation of environmentally conscious fiscal policies, and the use of eco-friendly construction technology. The tourist sector in India may greatly benefit by aggressively promoting sustainable globalization, encouraging innovation, adaptation, and stabilization, and placing a major focus on eco-tourism regionalism. This article provides useful insights for policymakers aiming to improve environmental sustainability in the tourism industry. The report highlights the significance of green financing and suggests specific policy measures to guide the adoption of sustainable practices in India's tourist sector.

AB  - Poultry-processing industries generate substantial quantities of waste, posing significant environmental challenges due to the complexity of handling and disposal. This study explores an innovative solution that combines thermochemical treatment of poultry waste with furrow-diking technology to transform non-recyclable feathers and bones into biochar-a nutrient-rich soil amendment. The research identifies optimal pyrolysis conditions for biochar production and evaluates its effects on soil moisture retention, compaction reduction, and erosion control. Experimental trials on sloped terrains reveal that incorporating biochar into compartmentalized furrows enhances water-holding capacity and soil structure, providing a sustainable approach to addressing agricultural challenges. Pyrolyzing poultry waste at 500 degrees C produced biochar with high nitrogen content and stability, capable of retaining up to 90% of its mass in water and significantly reducing soil compaction. Furthermore, applying 10 metric tons of biochar per hectare can sequester 5-8 metric tons of carbon annually, contributing to long-term carbon mitigation and regenerative agriculture. This integrated methodology combines waste valorization with ecological restoration, unlocking new opportunities for scalable and sustainable soil-management solutions.

The status and future perspectives of biomass for industrial heat mainly based on the German example are reviewed, and a more differentiated consideration by a newly introduced method is attempted. The article focuses on temperature levels above 200 degrees C combined with an individual examination of most energy-consuming industrial subsectors according to the feasibility of biomass utilization. Numerous studies conclude that biomass use will shift substantially from residential to industrial heat. Results indicate that biomass could play a bigger role especially for cement and clinker production, but they indicate also a significant need for further research and development to take final conclusions.

AB  - The Sea of Okhotsk is one of the world's largest marginal seas; its benthic fauna, especially from deeper parts, remains virtually unexplored. The material for this study was collected in the Sea of Okhotsk, Bussol Strait, and from the northern slope of the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench, during the Russian-German expedition Sea of Okhotsk Biodiversity Studies (SokhoBio) onboard the RV Akademik M.A. Lavrentyev in 2015. Material was collected using a camera-equipped epibenthic sledge (C-EBS). Forty-six tanaidacean species representing 31 genera and 12 families were found in 19 samples collected at depths from 1696 to 4798 m. All the species were new to science. The highest number of species (44) was recorded in the deepest part of the Sea of Okhotsk (Kuril Basin), followed by the northern slope of the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench (16 species) and the Bussol Strait (3 species). Almost one-third of all tanaidaceans (14 species) were common to both sides of the Kuril Island archipelago. Our results reveal a substantial faunal exchange between those two areas, although the small number of samples makes final conclusions about faunal similarity between the Sea of Okhotsk and the Pacific Ocean not fully possible. The level of rarity and patchiness of the tanaidacean fauna was high. The large number of species and individuals per sample observed in the Sea of Okhotsk might reflect high food availability in this area.

AB  - The urgency of the climate crisis is such that it needs to inform most policy-making. It represents a major threat to human development. Yet while the existence of the crisis is generally acknowledged, this has not affected macro-economic policy even though the climate crisis has major effects on the accepted objectives of macro-economic policy, including growth and economic stability. The paper explores changes in macro-economic policy needed for sustainability which should become an intrinsic and overriding objective of policy. Implications of doing so are explored, including replacing the growth objective with green/sustainable growth, altering the measurement of GDP accordingly; greatly increasing the weight given to the well-being of future generations with implications for interest and investment rates; and reforming taxes and expenditures. Ballooning of debt is justified to support a rapid transition to a carbon-free economy. Among high-income countries, the growth objective should be questioned. Low income countries need green growth to attain reasonable living standards. Large-scale resource transfers to low income countries are essential to support green expenditures for mitigation and especially adaptation. High priorities are a change in the approach of the IMF and World Bank, and innovative financial mechanisms to support the required transfers.

AB  - We consider the filtering problem of estimating a hidden random variable X by noisy observations. The noisy observation process is constructed by a randomized Markov bridge (RMB) of which terminal value is set to . That is, at the terminal time T, the noise of the bridge process vanishes and the hidden random variable X is revealed. We derive the explicit filtering formula, governing the dynamics of the conditional probability process, for a general RMB. It turns out that the conditional probability is given by a function of current time t, the current observation , the initial observation , and the a priori distribution nu of X at t = 0. As an example for an RMB, we explicitly construct the skew-normal randomized diffusion bridge and show how it can be utilized to extend well-known commodity pricing models and how one may propose novel stochastic price models for financial instruments linked to greenhouse gas emissions.

AB  - Purpose - This paper seeks to demonstrate that gender research is crucial to understanding post-socialist transformations and wider changes in social life. Focused on employment experiences and gender identities of two generations of Bulgarian women, it aims to highlight the complex intertwining of social structure and individual agency and to point out how processes of continuity and change constitute the post-socialist transformation and individual life journeys. Design/methodology/approach - Informed by feminist analyses, of gender and citizenship, generation theory and qualitative interviews, the paper employs the notion of gender imaginaries in comparing continuity and change in gender policy and individual experiences. Findings - The paper argues that significant changes occurred after 1989 in the ways official gender imaginaries were constructed through law, policy, and public discourses. In comparison to this, individual women's gender imaginaries entailed not only change but also sustained attachment to paid work, rejection of domesticity, and continued feelings of gender equality. This suggests that stable and often unquestioned notions of gender had a significant role for individual imaginaries. In addition to this, some of the most considerable changes were manifested in the notions of risk and uncertainty, which have become central aspects of the post-socialist gender imaginary, particularly in relation to paid work. Originality/value - The paper engages in a comparison of employment experiences of two generations of women thus directing its enquiry to the combination of individuals' agency in crafting one's life journey and the constraints of social structures and existing gender inequalities. Thus, transformations in individual lived lives of women are seen as interrelated with social change and historic location.

AB  - Nanotechnology is a promising means for development of sustainable agriculture while the study of nanoparticle-mediated plant disease resistance is still in its primary stage. Nanotechnology has shown great promise in regulating: the content of secondary metabolites, inducing disease resistance genes, delivering hormones, delivering biomolecules (such as: nucleotides, proteins, and activators), and obtaining transgenic plants to resist plant diseases. In this review, we conclude its versatility and applicability in disease management strategies and diagnostics and as molecular tools. With the advent of new biotechnologies (e.g. de novo regeneration, CRISPR/Cas9, and GRF4-GIF1 fusion protein), we discuss the potential of nanoparticles as an optimal platform to deliver biomolecules to plants for genetic engineering. In order to ensure the safe use and social acceptance of plant nanoparticle technology, its adverse effects are discussed, including the risk of transferring nanoparticles through the food chain.

AB  - Land-use frontiers are territories with abundant land for agriculture and forestry, availability of natural resources relative to labor or capital and predisposed to rapid land-use change, often driven by large-scale land investments and capitalized actors, producing commodities for distal markets. Strategic spatial planning (SSP) represents a consolidated long-term governance practice across high- and low-income countries. One of the objectives of SSP processes is to articulate a more coherent and future-oriented spatial logic for the sustainability of land-use patterns and typologies, natural-resources protection, and investments. SSP may thus constitute a useful approach in addressing some of the challenges affecting land governance in frontier settings; to date, its potential contribution to land-use frontiers lacks explicit exploration. In this paper, we examine how SSP can play a role in governing land-use frontiers through a case-study analysis of Mozambique as an emerging frontier, located on the southeast coast of Africa. We gathered empirical evidence by interviewing experts involved in resource management, territorial planning, and development in the country. The theoretical spine of the paper builds on the literature focusing on land-use challenges and SSP. We show that emerging land-use frontiers face several challenges, such as transnational land deals and the intensification of commercial plantations. Interview data show that several structural factors are hindering the establishment of a long-term territorial development strategy. These are, among others, the short-termism of political cycles and the absence of a long-term strategic vision. Our analysis reveals that SSP processes could contribute to addressing land-use challenges in frontier contexts, such as poverty traps and land degradation spirals, should various local and distant actors join forces and marry interests. We conclude by presenting a systematic rationale, explaining how SSP could play a role in governing land-use frontiers, with a view to promoting the well-being and sustainability of rural communities.

AB  - Tighter environmental regulations and more heavy-end upgrading in the petroleum industry lead to increased demand for hydrogen in oil refineries. In this paper, a systematic methodology is proposed to select appropriate purifiers from pressure swing adsorption processes, membranes or hybrid systems for recovering hydrogen from refinery off-gases. Through the understanding of the trade-offs between hydrogen saving, compression costs and capital investment, a superstructure is built to include possible purification scenarios. The shortcut models for different purification units are developed via the insights of the processes. The recovery rate of purifiers is also modelled to optimize process parameters. This method achieves the optimal design for overall hydrogen networks at a conceptual level.

AB  - Composite materials are widely used in different engineering fields and they are very efficient for engineering applications. Several composite materials are in use along with the technological innovations in materials and construction techniques. This study focuses on the monolayer prepreg (MP) composites and graphene-reinforced monolayer prepreg (GMP) composites and their structural contribution to the structural performance of concrete beams. The main objectives of the study are (1) to understand the mechanical properties of the MP and GMP composites, (2) to investigate the influence of graphene on the mechanical characterizations of the MP composites and (3) to compare the strengthening effectiveness and configurations of the MP and GMP composites applied to plain concrete (PC) beams. For this purpose, the MP and GMP composites are produced as continuous sheets and concrete beams are strengthened with these sheets considering four different internal and external strengthening configurations. The flexural behavior of the PC beams is compared to reinforced beams with MP and GMP composites through experiments, numerical simulations and statistical tests. The results indicate that the tensile strength of the MP composite increases by addition of graphene leading to more effective strengthening by the GMP composites, especially with external configuration, than the MP composites.

AB  - Harvesting stumps after clear-cutting can increase bioenergy supplies and thus reduce needs for fossil fuels, but more knowledge is required about associated changes in greenhouse gas emissions from forest soils to assess the climatic impact of extracting stumps for this purpose. The soil disturbance caused by harvesting stumps may alter soil processes, including N mineralization. N availability is an important determinant of emissions of the potent greenhouse gases N2O and CH4. Effects of stump harvest on these gases are largely unknown. Therefore, they were explored in this study by monitoring differences in N2O and CH4 emissions associated with different types of disturbance during two years following stump harvest and site preparation (as well as their overall effects) at three mesic sites, using the chamber technique. N2O emissions at two of the sites were affected by the type of soil disturbance, but not at the other site. At one site, the N2O emissions were highest from undisturbed soil and mounds and significantly lower from mixed soil, bare mineral soil and wheel ruts. At this site the emission rates were clearly correlated with N availability across the disturbances. At the second site showing significant treatment effects, N2O emissions were higher from the bare mineral soil after site preparation than from other types of disturbed soil. At the third site there were no significant N2O emissions, possibly due to reductions in nitrogen availability caused by the fast establishment of vegetation at that site. The CH4 fluxes included both uptakes and losses, but were generally low following all types of soil disturbances, although they were substantial from wheel ruts and soil pits. In conclusion there were no, or minor, between treatment differences in N2O and CH4 emissions. Furthermore, the radiative forcing potential of these emissions was small compared to mean CO2 emissions from Swedish clear-cuts. Thus, our results indicate that stumps can be harvested without causing elevated emissions of N2O and CH4 on mesic sites. The effects on wetter sites remain to be illuminated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hurricanes and typhoons are tracking further poleward due to the effects of climate change, according to a synthesis of numerical modelling results, observations and palaeoclimate records. Tropical cyclones (TCs, also known as hurricanes and typhoons) generally form at low latitudes with access to the warm waters of the tropical oceans, but far enough off the equator to allow planetary rotation to cause aggregating convection to spin up into coherent vortices. Yet, current prognostic frameworks for TC latitudes make contradictory predictions for climate change. Simulations of past warm climates, such as the Eocene and Pliocene, show that TCs can form and intensify at higher latitudes than of those during pre-industrial conditions. Observations and model projections for the twenty-first century indicate that TCs may again migrate poleward in response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, which poses profound risks to the planet's most populous regions. Previous studies largely neglected the complex processes that occur at temporal and spatial scales of individual storms as these are poorly resolved in numerical models. Here we review this mesoscale physics in the context of responses to climate warming of the Hadley circulation, jet streams and Intertropical Convergence Zone. We conclude that twenty-first century TCs will most probably occupy a broader range of latitudes than those of the past 3 million years as low-latitude genesis will be supplemented with increasing mid-latitude TC favourability, although precise estimates for future migration remain beyond current methodologies.

AB  - It is more and more acknowledged that land-use/cover dynamic change has become a key subject urgently to be dealt with in the study of global environmental change. Supported by the Landsat TM digital images, spatial patterns and temporal variation of land-use change during 1995 -2000 are studied in the paper. According to the land-use dynamic degree model, supported by the 1km GRID data of land-use change and the comprehensive characters of physical, economic and social features, a dynamic regionalization of land-use change is designed to disclose the spatial pattern of land-use change processes. Generally speaking, in the traditional agricultural zones, e.g., Huang-Huai-Hai Plains, Yangtze River Delta and Sichuan Basin, the built-up and residential areas occupy a great proportion of arable land, and in the interlock area of farming and pasturing of northern China and the oases agricultural zones, the reclamation I of arable land is conspicuously driven by changes of production conditions, economic benefits and climatic conditions. The implementation of "returning arable land into woodland or grassland" policies has won initial success in some areas, but it is too early to say that the trend of deforestation has been effectively reversed across China. In this paper, the division of dynamic regionalization of land-use change is designed, for the sake of revealing the temporal and spatial features of land-use change and laying the foundation for the study of regional scale land-use changes. Moreover, an integrated study, including studies of spatial pattern and temporal process of land-use change, is carried out in this paper, which is an interesting try on the comparative studies of spatial pattern on change process and the change process of spatial pattern of land-use change.

AB  - California's diverse geography and meteorological conditions necessitate models capturing fine-grained patterns of air pollution distribution. This study presents the development of high-resolution (100 m) daily land use regression (LUR) models spanning 1989-2021 for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and ozone (O3) across California. These machine learning LUR algorithms integrated comprehensive data sources, including traffic, land use, land cover, meteorological conditions, vegetation dynamics, and satellite data. The modeling process incorporated historical air quality observations utilizing continuous regulatory, fixed site saturation, and Google Streetcar mobile monitoring data. The model performance (adjusted R2) for NO2, PM2.5, and O3 was 84 %, 65 %, and 92 %, respectively. Over the years, NO2 concentrations showed a consistent decline, attributed to regulatory efforts and reduced human activities on weekends. Traffic density and weather conditions significantly influenced NO2 levels. PM2.5 concentrations also decreased over time, influenced by aerosol optical depth (AOD), traffic density, weather, and land use patterns, such as developed open spaces and vegetation. Industrial activities and residential areas contributed to higher PM2.5 concentrations. O3 concentrations exhibited no significant annual trend, with higher levels observed on weekends and lower levels associated with traffic density due to the scavenger effect. Weather conditions and land use, such as commercial areas and water bodies, influenced O3 concentrations. To extend the prediction of daily NO2, PM2.5, and O3 to 1989, models were developed for predictors such as daily road traffic, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)-NO2, monthly AOD, and OMI-O3. These models enabled effective estimation for any period with known daily weather conditions. Longitudinal analysis revealed a consistent NO2 decline, regulatory-driven PM2.5 decreases countered by wildfire impacts, and spatially variable O3 concentrations with no long-term trend. This study enhances understanding of air pollution trends, aiding in identifying lifetime exposure for statewide populations and supporting informed policy decisions and environmental justice advocacy.

AB  - Deforestation has been at the heart of the transformation of the Amazon. Global concerns over deforestation and its impact on climate change have resulted in the adoption of a number of initiatives in the framework of zero deforestation. However, undifferentiated application of the concepts of zero net, gross, and illegal deforestation has revealed a lack of understanding of their scope and of challenges to their implementation. Zero legal and illegal deforestation is, in particular, a controversial subject from the point of view of regulation and sovereignty but an essential aspect from the perspective of public policy design. In Colombia, zero deforestation commitments make no mention of legal deforestation. Papers that analyze deforestation and official data sources fail to incorporate the legal dimension in their analysis. This article addresses this gap by identifying areas where deforestation is legal and where it is illegal in one deforestation hotspot of the Colombian Amazon, the administrative department of Guaviare. Our results show that deforestation has increased since 2013, mainly occurs in illegal zones, and that Guaviare department, 85% of which is covered by forest, has very little legal deforestation potential. Our findings reveal that assessing the legality and illegality of deforestation is more complex than often assumed and must become a priority, especially in forested countries where regulation on forest and land management is shared between different level of governments and institutions.

AB  - The underground layers of cities are constantly concreted with urban transformation projects. The studies on built environment mainly focus on the morphological changes, related dispossessions and observable aspects of urban landscape. However, the environmental costs of transformations are not limited to the impacts of above-ground interventions. In Istanbul, the major impact of subterranean interventions is the destruction of water and soil ecosystems as well as its multi-layered heritage as the large-scale urban transformation decisions are primarily applied to historic neighbourhoods where the existing building stock was appropriated by the urban precariat. The urban transformation projects in historic neighbourhoods of Istanbul come into question with socio-economic dispossessions rather than environmental justice. In this manuscript, the main aim is to address the socio-ecological impacts of planning and architectural design decisions disregarding subterranean construction density, through the case of Tarlaba & scedil;& imath; in Istanbul. Tarlaba & scedil;& imath; represents one of the most emblematic case in Istanbul's urban resistance history and evokes eco-dystopias, which may be attributed to the decisions that justify stigmatisation. With the context, conceptual frame and scope set by these problem definitions, while considering urban inequality a pre-condition of environmental justice, this manuscript examines the correlation between environmental policies, social stigmatisation and flexed environmental values in planning and architecture culture via local political ecology. The methodology employed in the study is based on qualitative analysis of the stages and legal decisions involved. Archival documents on the study area were used to identify the local variables contributing to the deterioration of socio-ecological unity for future discussions.

AB  - This study compares eddy-covariance measurements of carbon dioxide fluxes at six northern temperate and boreal peatland sites in Canada and the northern United States of America, representing both bogs and fens. The two peatland types had opposite responses of gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) to inter-annual fluctuations in water table level. At fens, wetter conditions were correlated with lower GEP and ER, while at bogs wetter conditions were correlated with higher GEP and ER. We hypothesize that these contrasting responses are due to differences in the relative contributions of vascular plants and mosses. The coherence of our results between sites representing a range of average environmental conditions indicates ecosystem-scale differences in resilience to hydrological changes that should be taken into account when considering the future of peatland ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration under changing environmental conditions.

AB  - Little is known about seasonal changes in burrowing activity and burrow architecture in subterranean African mole-rats (Bathyergidae, Rodentia). The solitary genus Heliophobius is the least known genus of this family. We examined burrow systems of the silvery mole-rat (Heliophobius argenteocinereus) in Malawi in two periods of the dry season. Burrow pattern was influenced by the time of the year, becoming more reticulated at the peak of the dry season when soil was dry and hard. Overall digging activity did not cease during the dry season; yet burrowing strategy changed and the soil was deposited in tunnels rather than transported to mounds. The length of burrow systems was correlated with the body mass of the respective occupants. In spite of their solitary habits - and contrary to the prediction of the aridity food-distribution hypothesis - silvery mole-rats are able to occupy poor habitats with low food supply.

AB  - We present an efficient methodology for assessing leakage detectability at geologic carbon sequestration sites under parameter uncertainty. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) and risk assessment are integral and, in many countries, mandatory components of geologic carbon sequestration projects. A primary goal of risk assessment is to evaluate leakage potential from anthropogenic and natural features, which constitute one of the greatest threats to the integrity of carbon sequestration repositories. The backbone of our detectability assessment framework is the probability collocation method (PCM), an efficient, nonintrusive, uncertainty-quantification technique that can enable large-scale stochastic simulations that are based on results from only a small number of forward-model runs. The metric for detectability is expressed through an extended signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which incorporates epistemic uncertainty associated with both reservoir and aquifer parameters. The spatially heterogeneous aquifer hydraulic conductivity is parameterized using Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion. Our methodology is demonstrated numerically for generating probability maps of pressure anomalies and for calculating SNRs. Results indicate that the likelihood of detecting anomalies depends on the level of uncertainty and location of monitoring wells. A monitoring well located close to leaky locations may not always yield the strongest signal of leakage when the level of uncertainty is high. Therefore, our results highlight the need for closed-loop site characterization, monitoring network design, and leakage source detection. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Food availability plays a key role in animal movements. Anthropogenic p wisioning of food to wildlife is a common practice of unprecedented magnitude worldwide and is of increasing conservation concern. Ungulate supplementary feeding is widespread in game management; however its effects on non-target species have received little attention. Here, we investigate how ungulate feeding affects the movement behavior of a non-target species, the brown bear (Ursus arctos). We tracked bear movements in the Northeastern Carpathians (1500 km2) and inventoried 212 ungulate feeding sites. We analyzed encounter rates of nine GPS-collared bears with ungulate feeding sites (1658 km, n=49 tracks) and compared them with the corresponding encounter rate of simulated tracks. We also estimated the encounter rate with feeding sites using snow-tracking of unknown bears (232 km, n = 40 tracks). GPS-tracked bears encountered feeding sites three times more frequently (mean + SE= 0.154 +/- 0.022 per km travelled) than would be expected if they were moving randomly (0.054 +/- 0.0010 per km random walk). The rate was even higher for snow-tracked bears, which visited on average 0.926 +/- 0.271 feeding sites per kilometer travelled. This suggests a link between the winter activity of some individuals and their frequent use of feeding sites. Bears seemed to rely on spatial memory and patrol known sites, independent of whether food was available at the feeding sites. This alteration of the natural behavior of species with behavioral flexibility, such as brown bears, could be interpreted as a sign of environmental degradation. Our results demonstrate an important effect of ungulate feeding on the movement ecology of non-target species. We warn of the impacts of this practice on species and ecosystems and highlight the need to preserve natural movement behaviors and urgently reevaluate management practices involving food provisioning to wildlife.

AB  - The traditional rules of profit maximization and cost-cutting constrain the industries. Their failure to stop environmental degradation has recently forced them to work on sustainable supply chain management. The government has developed many carbon emission regulations to decrease the potential risk of industry greenhouse gas emissions. So, the present analysis acknowledges the influence of carbon tax and partially backlogged shortages for products with demand driven by market potential, consumer desire for green products, and product pricing. Additionally, the deterioration of products over time, which is affected by investments in preservation technologies, is considered. The research formulates the unit green degree and preservation technology investment as decision variables to identify the inventory model's optimal total cost. The traditional optimization approach is used to determine the value of the decision variables. The report offers insights into establishing an optimum balance between supply chain and environmental responsibility using numerical and sensitivity analysis.

AB  - In the United States, utility-scale solar initiatives face growing local resistance despite their cost-competitiveness and potential in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. This study investigates the marginal effects of knowledge levels related to solar, information treatments, and their interconnections with peoples' attitudes toward utility- scale solar energy systems and explores some key drivers of the different knowledge levels. We designed and implemented a survey targeting both public officials and the general population in the U.S. state of Iowa. Among 862 respondents, 79.8% self-reported having a low level of knowledge about solar energy. Additionally, 77.7% expressed at least moderate support for hosting such projects in their community. Our empirical results suggest that individuals with a higher level of knowledge of utility-scale solar energy tend to express a higher degree of support for adopting such projects within their community. Individuals' attitudes are more responsive to the negative information treatment. Notably, there are significant differences between public officials and the general population in attitudes and responsiveness to information treatments. We also find that landowners' support for utility-scale solar projects is unlikely to change regardless of knowledge levels, while non-landowners show increased support with higher levels of knowledge. This study provides insights for developing context-specific outreach programs to enhance public awareness and support for utility-scale solar projects and promote future solar development.

AB  - This paper explores the relationship between inequality and sustainability both of which are dominant considerations today. Inequality was an important preoccupation of Kaldor, although he was not concerned with sustainability, as this has only recently become an all-important issue. The paper identifies relevant criteria for determining the desirable distribution of incomes from a sustainability perspective, including considerations of justice and of instrumentality. It concludes that justice demands much greater equality of emissions (and incomes) among individuals, given that the total "safe" global emissions of carbon dioxide are limited. Instrumental considerations are not so clear-cut, as evidence suggests that sometimes greater inequality leads to reduced emissions. However, meta considerations, including motivations for pursuing economic growth and conditions likely to realise international agreements on restraining emissions, suggest that more equality within and between countries is needed to promote sustainability.

AB  - The growing share of wind and solar power in the total energy mix has caused severe problems in balancing the electrical power production. Consequently, in the future, all fossil fuel-based electricity generation will need to be run on a completely flexible basis. Microgas turbines (mGTs) constitute a mature technology which can offer such flexibility. Even though their greenhouse gas emissions are already very low, stringent carbon reduction targets will require them to be completely carbon neutral: this constraint implies the adoption of postcombustion carbon capture (CC) on these energy systems. Despite this attractive solution, an in-depth study along with a robust optimization of this system has not yet been carried out. Hence, in this paper, a typical mGT with exhaust gas recirculation has been coupled with an amine-based CC plant and simulated using the software ASPEN PLUS. A rigorous rate-based simulation of the CO2 absorption and desorption in the CC unit offers an accurate prediction; however, its time complexity and convergence difficulty are severe limitations for a stochastic optimization. Therefore, a surrogate-based optimization approach has been used, which makes use of a Gaussian process regression (GPR) model, trained using the ASPEN PLUS data, to quickly find operating points of the plant at a very low computational cost. Using the validated surrogate model, a stochastic optimization has been carried out. As a general result, the analyzed power plant proves to be intrinsically very robust, even when the input variables are affected by strong uncertainties.

AB  - The quest for sustainability and reduction of human impact on the planet has led to discussions about environmental efficiency in the manufacture and use of automotive vehicles. The advancement of environmental and government laws has encouraged the automotive industry to seek constant improvements in safety, fuel economy and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. To achieve these goals, reducing the weight of vehicles has been considered a relevant strategy, with several research and development efforts in search of high-tech materials and innovative design. The assessment of the life cycle of vehicles, from the extraction of raw materials to the end of their useful life, is essential for estimating environmental impacts. In this context, this paper focuses on the life cycle analysis of vehicles with new generation steel structures (Body in White Solution) compared to current steels (Body in White Baseline), aiming at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by reducing of the thickness of the steel plates, maintaining the mechanical properties necessary to guarantee the safety of the vehicle. The methodology of this study was divided into the evaluation of Body in White (BIW) mass in current steels (Baseline) and in advanced high resistance steels (Solution); detailing the vehicular life cycle from the extraction of materials to its end of life; in the estimation of greenhouse gas emissions through simulation and in the comparison of vehicle emissions with BIW in current steels and in advanced high resistance steels. As a result, it was possible to observe that, in the comparison of the CO 2 footprint, modeled in the Eco Audit, there is a 15% reduction in emissions in the CO 2 footprint for the BIW solution, as well as a 7% reduction in the C eq total , in the on -site test and a saving of 260.40 L in fuel consumption, that is, the reduction in vehicle weight plays a significant role in reducing CO 2 emissions, providing a mitigation factor for global warming.

AB  - The feasibility of chemical stabilization-based strategy for extensive field application is under debate due to lacking a proper framework for its sustainability assessment during its life cycle. Herein, a comprehensive framework consisting of crop production, soil quality, and carbon footprintwas constructed for assessing agricultural land remediation based on a two-year paddy field trial. Results showthat between the two representative agents, biochar scenario substantially benefits for environmental, social, and agricultural sustainability, because of its more positive impacts on human health and ecosystem, public acceptance, soil reproductive, and rice yield. A notably higher sustainability score of 80.7 for biochar scenario than that of 47.0 for lime is found, in spite of the economical sustainability of lime. The net ecosystem carbon budget of the biochar scenario exhibits an unprecedentedly positive value of 17.8 t CO2-eq ha(-1), which can finely contribute to a positive carbon budget during remediation. Our finding demonstrates that biochar strategy enables a multi-objective achievement of soil quality - crop production - carbon budget during agricultural land remediation. This study provides new insights into sustainability assessment for restoring agricultural land for safe crop production and synergizing with carbon neutral plan.

AB  - Geographical indications (GIs), protected by the European Union with the collective marks of PDO (protected designation of origin), PGI (protected geographical indication), and TSG (traditional specialty guaranteed), play an important role in the social and economic system. They not only guarantee food needs, but promote correct consumer information, protect local food, and play a role in the environmental and social sustainability of rural areas. In Italy, Parmigiano Reggiano (PR-RE) PDO cheese is ranked second in foods with the GI protection mark by turnover. This research aims to assess the financial sustainability of the firms registered in the PR-RE PDO consortium using financial statement (FINSTAT) analysis. Financial ratios (FR) and the EM-Score were applied to assess firms' performance, financial risk, and credit score. The analysis distinguished firms by legal form, cooperative and non-cooperative, and altitude range-plain hill and mountain. The main findings of the research were as follows: (1) a better performance of lowland non-cooperative firms and lower financial risk, (2) a longer duration of the inventory cycle of cooperative firms, and (3) a greater financial risk in mountain cooperatives. The results provide indications for improving firms' performance and for designing financial instruments for the sector. To our knowledge, this is the first research to carry out an analysis of all the available FINSTATs of firms in the PR-RE PDO sector.

AB  - In light of the pressing global challenges related to greenhouse gas emissions from the construction industry, current evaluation systems for green building construction sustainability remain limited, often overlooking sustainability domains. This study innovatively established an evaluation framework by exploring five critical domains: environmental sustainability, economic benefits, socio-cultural impacts, technological innovation, and health and well-being. Sixteen key evaluation indicators were identified using the Delphi method, with the novel inclusion of a carbon emission reduction target achievement indicator, thereby promoting the goal of carbon neutrality in green buildings. To determine a more reasonable weight distribution, this paper combined the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process(fuzzy AHP) with the entropy weight method. Additionally, the study employed a fuzzy matter-element method enhanced by genetic algorithms for precise evaluation of green building construction sustainability. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model were validated through an empirical analysis of a green building project in Beijing. The results of this research provide innovative theoretical references and practical guidelines for green building construction sustainability evaluation

AB  - Membrane technology has shown a promising role in combating water scarcity, a globally faced challenge. However, the disposal of end-of-life membrane modules is problematic as the current practices include incineration and landfills as their final fate. In addition, the increase in population and lifestyle advancement have significantly enhanced waste generation, thus overwhelming landfills and exacerbating environmental repercussions and resource scarcity. These practices are neither economically nor environmentally sustainable. Recycling membranes and utilizing recycled material for their manufacturing is seen as a potential approach to address the aforementioned challenges. Depending on physiochemical conditions, the end-of-life membrane could be reutilized for similar, upgraded, and downgraded operations, thus extending the membrane lifespan while mitigating the environmental impact that occurred due to their disposal and new membrane preparation for similar purposes. Likewise, using recycled waste such as polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate, polyvinyl chloride, tire rubber, keratin, and cellulose and their derivates for fabricating the membranes can significantly enhance environmental sustainability. This study advocates for and supports the integration of sustainability concepts into membrane technology by presenting the research carried out in this area and rigorously assessing the achieved progress. The membranes' recycling and their fabrication utilizing recycled waste materials are of special interest in this work. Furthermore, this study offers guidance for future research endeavors aimed at promoting environmental sustainability.

AB  - In order to develop a more nuanced model of consumer behaviour and the dynamics of behavioural change, this paper argues, the discourse of sustainable consumption needs to draw more fully upon the sociological literature addressing consumption, its varied drivers, and the complex roles it plays within contemporary life. Since its revival in the 1980s, the sociology of consumption has largely focused on the ways in which everyday consumption choices in affluent societies facilitate the process of creating and sustaining a 'self-identity'. While the literature in this field is not without its own flaws, framing sustainable consumption in relation to the problem of self-identity enables us to confront not only the psycho-cultural factors that maintain demand for material goods, but also the difficulties faced by ordinary people as they try to understand and respond ethically to large-scale social and ecological problems within an everyday environment that is highly commodified and individualized.

AB  - Scholarly work in economic geography and regional science has recently seen a renewed interest in spatial inequalities, driven significantly by the debate on left-behind places and the resulting geographies of discontent. The plight of left-behind places calls for new place-based policy responses that address the specific challenges of these regions but that at the same time address grand societal challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, or pollution with synthetic chemicals. Despite growing attention among economic geographers and regional scientists to either green or inclusive regional development approaches, how to reconcile environmental sustainability and social inclusiveness in highly challenged left-behind places remains poorly understood. This editorial reflects on and critically discusses the literature on left-behind places and distils unifying conceptual characteristics of left-behindness. We argue that left-behindness is a temporal, relational, multidimensional, discursive, but not deterministic concept. The non-determinism of left-behindness opens up different choices for actors to shape regional futures. Imagining and negotiating these futures involves dealing with difficult potential trade-offs between environmental sustainability and social inclusiveness, some of which are explored by the articles in this special issue.

AB  - Sustainable business model innovation is increasingly viewed as a lever for systems change for sustainability across businesses and industries. Banks hold a unique intermediary role in sustainable development, but also have a difficult position after the 2008 financial crisis. This paper aims to explore business models for sustainability in the service industry, particularly banking. It explores the receptiveness of customers towards sustainable business models pursued by banks. The retail banking industry in Hong Kong is the focus of this work. First, a practice review and semi-structured interviews are used to develop and validate a set of sustainable business model archetypes for the banking industry. Second, surveys are conducted to test customer receptiveness for the archetypes. Eight sustainable business model archetypes for banking are developed and validated. "Substitute with digital processes", "adopt a stewardship role" and "encourage sufficiency" are most welcomed by customers. Some archetypes seem at direct odds with current business practice, such as "encourage sufficiency". This study gives an insight to how to "do good and do well" in the banking industry. Further research on the attributes of these archetypes can be conducted to gain a deeper understanding why customers prefer banks to use these archetypes. (C) 2017 The Authors.

One aspect of sustainable consumption focused on in this study is the environment friendly purchase or green purchase. Using data collected from consumers in 14 cities in China, we found that consumers who reported green purchase intention and behavior had higher scores in life satisfaction compared to other consumers after controlling for gender, age, education, and family income. The findings add evidence to the literature that suggests happiness is associated with prosocial spending (Dunn et al., Science 319: 1687-1688 in 2008).

AB  - Achieving deep cuts in the carbon footprints of everyday consumption is an indispensable component of climate actions globally, not least in the wealthier nations. Can sustainable consumption-and especially reduced consumption-enhance human well-being as stipulated by theories of the "well-being dividend" as well as contribute to environmental improvements? This article presents an empirical study of the well-being dividend among communities of "zero waste" in Chinese cities. Using 45 in-depth interviews and virtual ethnography of zero-waste practitioners, I explore how sustainable consumption could satisfy multiple human needs and enhance individual and collective well-being. This research highlights the significance of lifestyle communities in processes of needs fulfillment and points to how contemporary societies could enable sustainable needs fulfillment by giving special protections to synergic need satisfiers-starting by allowing green communities to flourish and thrive. Further, through the concept of "teleoaffective regimes," this article brings to light how concerns over well-being give rise to shared ends, goals, and emotions within communities, hinting at the importance of engaging with people's core pursuit of well-being in sustainability transformations. Finally, the vast majority of studies on sustainable well-being have focused on Western countries. By contrast, this work provides insights into this topic from China and raises critical questions about the dynamics between growth, consumption, and well-being in developing nations. It also calls for further exploration of more sustainable models of "development" that center on delivering well-being to all within planetary boundaries.

AB  - The Coronavirus Disease 2019 has resulted in a transition from physical education to online learning, leading to a collapse of the established educational order and a wisdom test for the education governance system. As a country seriously affected by the pandemic, the health of the Indian higher education system urgently requires assessment to achieve sustainable development and maximize educational externalities. This research systematically proposes a health assessment model from four perspectives, including educational volume, efficiency, equality, and sustainability, by employing the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution Model, Principal Component Analysis, DEA-Tobit Model, and Augmented Solow Model. Empirical results demonstrate that India has high efficiency and an absolute health score in the higher education system through multiple comparisons between India and the other selected countries while having certain deficiencies in equality and sustainability. Additionally, single-target and multiple-target path are simultaneously proposed to enhance the Indian current education system. The multiple-target approach of the India-China-Japan-Europe-USA process is more feasible to achieve sustainable development, which would improve the overall health score from.351 to .716. This finding also reveals that the changes are relatively complex and would take 91.5 years considering the relationship between economic growth rates and crucial indicators. Four targeted policies are suggested for each catching-up period, including expanding and increasing the social funding sources, striving for government expenditure support to improve infrastructures, imposing gender equality in education, and accelerating the construction of high-quality teachers.

AB  - To achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, we need economic means of sequestering carbon dioxide (CO2) and reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). We analyze the sequestration potential of the Intermountain West (IWest) region, US, as a primary energy transition hub through analysis of wellbore retrofit potential and emission reduction in both fugitive gas abatement and flare gas. We selected the I-West region due to its abundant energy sources and oil and gas production legacy. Preliminary analysis hints that well retrofits can breathe new life into a well at a fraction of the cost of a new drill. With millions of potential candidates in the US, even a modest fraction (1% or less) suitable for retrofit could accelerate the shift to large-scale CO2 sequestration. Fugitive gas, the unintentional release of wellbore gases such as methane, is a significant emissions source. Through conservative analysis, it is estimated that wellhead leakage alone may account for 5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions. We conclude by assessing the CO2 emissions from flaring, which is the burning of associated gas during well operations, conservative analysis indicates flaring contributes another 2 million tonnes of CO2 emissions to the region. We find that with targeted retrofit and better controls on emissions sources, the I-West region can make a significant impact in the nation's push to become net-zero. This study outlines economic feasibility and actionable items to achieve the critical reductions in emissions and increases in sequestration necessary to attain net zero.

AB  - Scenario planning is a common tool used for dealing with uncertainty in rapidly changing situations. The aim of this paper is to create a practical framework for developing sustainable land use scenarios that has direct policy relevance. The framework was created and tested in a pen-urban area, Rocky Point in South-East Queensland, Australia. The framework, which is driven by participatory processes and consists of an iterative combination of three steps: context assessment, decision structuring and decision analysis. The participatory process involved a range of actors engaged through steering committees, public meetings, focus groups, questionnaires and interviews. The outputs from these activities were four landscape scale scenarios which were sustainably assessed by an impact matrix and equity matrix (relating to a dendrogram of coalition). Critically, these outputs also identified the possible formation of three new social alliances amongst key local actors considered necessary for the manifestation of any of the future scenarios. Application of this framework demonstrated its usefulness to inform policy by outcomes already being included in current policy documents. Additionally, the framework will inform future scenario developers by including: (i) a flexible participatory process able to respond to local contextual needs; (ii) capability to identify 'triggers for change' by actors to delineate alternate scenarios; and (iii) development of 'enabling policies' as part of the participatory process, to move towards target scenarios.

AB  - The global trend is shifting toward circular economy systems. It is a sustainable environmental approach that sustains economic growth from the use of resources while minimizing environmental impacts. The multiple industrial use of microalgal biomass has received great attention due to its high content of essential nutrients and elements. Nevertheless, low biomass productivity, unbalanced carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio, resistant cellular constituents, and the high cost of microalgal harvesting represent the major obstacles for valorization of algal biomass. In recent years, microalgae biomass has been a candidate as a potential feedstock for different bioenergy generation processes with simultaneous treating wastewater and CO2 capture. An overview of the appealing features and needed advancements is urgently essential for microalgae-derived bioenergy generation. The present review provides a timely outlook and evaluation of biomethane production from microalgal biomass and related challenges. Moreover, the biogas recovery potential from microalgal biomass through different pretreatments and synergistic anaerobic co-digestion (AcoD) with other biowastes are evaluated. In addition, the removal of micropollutants and heavy metals by microalgal cells via adsorption and bioaccumulation in their biomass is discussed. Herein, a comprehensive review is presented about a successive high-throughput for anaerobic digestion (AD) of the microalgal biomass in order to achieve for sustainable energy source. Lastly, the valorization of the digestate from AD of microalgae for agricultural reuse is highlighted.

AB  - The welfare state is challenged by the globalisabon of the world economy and by the fact that ageing populations demand more redistribution. To promote political and social sustainability in this context, the "destructive" forces of market competition have to be met by "constructive" social policies In Europe, the Scandinavian countries are the best performers in combining inequality reductions with high employment rates and excellent growth records. A framework for reform inspired by this starts from the notion that in order to be successful in meeting new needs with restricted resources we must improve incentives, human resources, social services and employment opportunities The ageing of our societies means we also need to rethink our policies in other ways. The discussion has, however, been unduly focused on pension reforms and savings to ensure future living standards for the elderly. Instead, we should focus more on how social policy interacts with education, fertility and other fundamental determinants of the future tax base. In order to design social policies that are sustainable for the future, we need to put our children and youth first The Swedish case is relevant here, with its institutions that promote gender balance and investment in life-long learning. We should, however, make sure that we base our policy recommendations not on wishful thinking but on a knowledge-based and realistic assessment of how the world works.

AB  - The development of sustainable urban landscapes challenges all stakeholders, including local governments as the major custodians thereof. The majority of urban ecological research done describes European and North American cities. South Africa's position in the global South underlines the potential that local research has in contributing to global knowledge. South African urban landscapes are rich in biodiversity and characterized by cultural diversity and steep socio-economic gradients. Spatial inequality, specifically access to resources and green areas, greatly influences the perceived importance and need of urban green space to citizens and policy makers. This legacy is a major challenge to the implementation of sustainability oriented contemporary urban planning and environmental management practices in South Africa. Sustainable solutions call for transdisciplinary approaches, in which the contributions of both non-academic and academic role players are integrated. Therefore, we investigated the possible interface between urban ecology, urban planning, and environmental management, within current policy and legislation frameworks and within practice in South Africa. We highlight certain aspects of the three disciplines that could contribute to transdisciplinary planning approaches, such as mapping and valuation of ecosystem services, strategic and integrated thinking, prediction and scenario building, governance, and decision-making and participatory planning. We believe that awareness of the major contributions of each discipline would refine the linkages between social and ecological issues proposed by several existing conceptual frameworks, leading to a transdisciplinary approach to plan for sustainable urban landscapes. The South African perspective presented in this paper could guide other (similar) global scenarios with regard to transdisciplinary planning approaches that could enhance the development of sustainable urban landscapes.

AB  - Global tantalum production from mines averages 1800 tons per year and hardly increases, but demand for tantalum in the electronics industry consistently increasing. Globally, 50% of total tantalum produced is being used for tantalum capacitors manufacturing, almost all demand from various industries is mainly met by primary resources only. Tantalum production and supply predominantly dominated by Congo and Rwanda which accounts for > 50%, add disadvantages for the strategic and economic competitiveness of other nations. To address the monopoly dominated by Congo and Rwanda, and the disparity of tantalum primary reserve, exploitation of secondary resources can alternatively address the drawbacks of primary resource distribution. Currently, hardly < 1% of tantalum getting recycled, and the poor recycling rate of tantalum is mainly contributed by the lack of efficient and sustainable valorization technology for recycling tantalum-bearing scraps like electronic capacitors and semiconductor industry tantalum scrap. In the current investigation, a sustainable tantalum extraction process from scrap dominated by hydrometallurgical route has been developed. Tantalum scrap which is passive to leach for tantalum recovery was calcinated for oxidation of TaN content and followed by tantalum has been leached using a mixture of NaF and HCl, a specially developed novel lixiviant for the purpose as an HF substituent. Calcination process parameter like temperature and time requirement for oxidation was optimized varying one parameter at a time. Then, the efficient leaching condition was optimized for quantitative leaching of tantalum. The process can achieve 99.99% efficient leaching, the process can successfully be applied for feasible industrial-scale tantalum scrap recycling. The HF substituent lixiviant can add advantages to overcome occupational and industrial operation safety challenges associated with HF lixiviant. The reported valorization process can be a sustainable tantalum recycling process that simultaneously can address UNO sustainable development goal, WEEE directive, and UNEP E-Waste Management goal.

AB  - Rapid and sustained economic growth has transformed China from a centrally planned low-income country to a middle-income market economy in just three decades. It is also well known that income inequality has increased substantially. The exact extent and nature of changes in income inequality, however, are still not entirely agreed upon. This paper analyses the nature and complexity of China's rising income inequality, pointing to some of the main reasons for the continued uncertainties surrounding its exact sources.

AB  - The stability of ecological communities is critical for the stable provisioning of ecosystem services, such as food and forage production, carbon sequestration, and soil fertility. Greater biodiversity is expected to enhance stability across years by decreasing synchrony among species, but the drivers of stability in nature remain poorly resolved. Our analysis of time series from 79 datasets across the world showed that stability was associated more strongly with the degree of synchrony among dominant species than with species richness. The relatively weak influence of species richness is consistent with theory predicting that the effect of richness on stability weakens when synchrony is higher than expected under random fluctuations, which was the case in most communities. Land management, nutrient addition, and climate change treatments had relatively weak and varying effects on stability, modifying how species richness, synchrony, and stability interact. Our results demonstrate the prevalence of biotic drivers on ecosystem stability, with the potential for environmental drivers to alter the intricate relationship among richness, synchrony, and stability.

AB  - Approximately one-third of the world's food production, i.e., 1.43 billion tons, is wasted annually, resulting in economic losses of nearly USD 940 billion and undermining food system sustainability. This waste depletes resources, contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, and negatively affects food security and prices. Although traditional packaging preserves food quality, it cannot satisfy the demands of extended shelf life, safety, and sustainability. Consequently, active packaging using biopolymer matrices containing antioxidants and antimicrobials is a promising solution. This review examines the current advancements in the integration of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) into biopolymer-based active packaging, focusing on their antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. CQDs provide unique advantages over traditional nanoparticles and natural compounds, including high biocompatibility, tunable surface functionality, and environmental sustainability. This review explores the mechanisms through which CQDs impart antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, their synthesis methods, and their functionalization to optimize the efficacy of biopolymer matrices. Recent studies have highlighted that CQD-enhanced biopolymers maintain biodegradability with enhanced antioxidant and antimicrobial functions. Additionally, potential challenges, such as toxicity, regulatory considerations, and scalability are discussed, offering insights into future research directions and industrial applications. This review demonstrates the potential of CQD-incorporated biopolymer matrices to transform active packaging, aligning with sustainability goals and advancing food preservation technologies.

AB  - Purpose This study aims to systematically examine gender specific behavioral differences and similarities in online shopping consumers, underlying theories for such differences and similarities and moderating and mediating roles of gender in studying the effects of online marketing strategies. This synthesis explores gender differences and similarities from a wide range of online settings, including readiness for adoption of new technology, willingness to make online payments, trust in online vendors, perception and behavior toward online business websites and perceived online service quality. Design/methodology/approach A systematic approach was adopted to derive and then analyze the existing literature. The authors accessed relevant literature from three electronic databases. After a thorough screening process and applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, the study shortlisted 61 academic articles from an initial pool of 187 papers. Findings The findings reveal more differences than similarities between men and women as online consumers. Men generally have more favorable attitudes toward e-tailers (electronic retailing), online purchase/re-purchase and e-payments than women do. Social influences positively affect the online purchase intentions of men and women, but they have a more substantial effect on women. Privacy concerns negatively affect the online trust of men and women, but they also manifest a more significant influence on women. Practical implications Findings of review guide practitioners in formulating effective positioning and communication strategies that enable them to appeal to gender-specific consumer segments in multiple products and business contexts. It offers guidelines to online businesses for developing e-business platforms (websites) that persuade the target audience across gender groups, based on consumer browsing and web navigation preferences. Originality/value This review fulfills the need for a systematic synthesis of empirical research vis-a-vis online consumer behavior studies to find gender-specific perceptions, attitudes and behaviors.

AB  - We identify optimal spatial targets for payments for forest carbon sequestration under the multiple objectives of maximizing forest carbon storage cost efficiency and maximizing economic impacts of payments. A further purpose is to evaluate the tradeoff between the two objectives. These objectives are used as targeting criteria in our case study of the Central and Southern Appalachian Region of the United States, a heavily forested, low-income region that could benefit from payments for forest carbon sequestration. The concave-shaped Pareto optimal frontiers between forest carbon storage and economic impacts triggered by payments provide evidence that the increase in economic impacts is relatively higher than the sacrifice in forest carbon benefits when the initial weight assigned to economic impacts is relatively lower than the initial weight assigned to forest carbon benefits and vice versa. Our projections of county-level forest carbon storage and economic impacts can help conservation agencies anticipate regional heterogeneity in forest carbon storage and economic impacts and access their tradeoffs.

AB  - The quantitative assessment of policies aimed at climate change mitigation requires rigorously identifying abnormal changes in greenhouse gas emissions. We present a new dataset of robust level changes in greenhouse gas emissions that cannot be explained by aggregate socioeconomic fluctuations. Modern methods of structural break identification based on two-way fixed effects models are employed to estimate the size of significant level changes in emissions. The resulting dataset spans information for all major greenhouse gases in OECD countries across 37 IPCC sectors, from 1995 to 2022. The data unveils large differences in abnormal changes in emissions across gases, countries and sectors, as well as over time. Our resulting data can be applied to a broad range of research questions, including the analysis of the comparative efficacy of policy instruments to mitigate climate change.

AB  - Forest ecosystem services (ES) provide significant value to society. Without means to adequately capture that value, societal ES values have little influence on landowners' management decisions, leading to inefficiencies in forest-based ES provision. To understand these inefficiencies, we employ data envelopment analysis (DEA) to assess three types of efficiency - technical, allocative and total profit - of planted pine forests using loblolly pine (Pines taeda L.) in the Southern US as an example. Field data from n = 28 plots are used to assess stand level efficiency in the production of timber, carbon sequestration, and species richness considering inputs such as site index, age and number of trees, precipitation and temperatures. Given the impacts of climate change on key inputs, we also assess efficiency under climate scenarios representing moderate (RCP4.5) and high (RCP8.5) greenhouse gas emissions pathways. We find that 96% of forest plots are technically efficient in providing timber, carbon sequestration and species richness and 75% are allocative or total profit efficient With climate change, allocative or total profit efficiency remains similar to the initial conditions, and total profit substantially increases (42.8% and 45.6% for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). These findings highlight the increasingly important role that forests play in providing sodally valuable ES. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lignocellulose biorefineries process biomass into 'green' chemicals and bioenergy and play a key role in sustainable bio-economies. Using sugarcane bagasse and trash feedstocks, biorefineries were simulated in Aspen Plus (R) v 8.6 to generate mass and energy balances. Four scenarios with electricity and furfural as common products were generated. Scenario A in addition produced high volume, low value levulinic acid whilst scenarios B1 and B2 generated low volume, high value levulinic acid at varied feedstock capacities. Scenario C produced low volume, high value levulinic acid and bulk gamma valerolactone. The four biorefineries were also compared to a combined heat and power plant that only produced steam and electricity. Aspen Plus (R) Economic Analyser and a discounted cash flow rate of return methodology were used to determine the economic feasibility of the bioenergy self-sufficient biorefineries annexed to a conventional South African sugar mill. Levulinic acid production via the Biofine process makes economic sense when produced for niche markets, due to the anticipated decrease in market prices when production volumes increase. Scenario (C) co-producing a low volume of levulinic acid (0.15 t h(-1)) together with 3.3 t h(-1) furfural, electricity (14 MWh) and 6.8 t h(-1) gamma valerolactone, was the most profitable. It attained an internal rate of return of 23% and 253 US$ million net present value at a 9.7% hurdle rate by matching chemicals' production volumes to market demands, to maintain high market prices for multiple revenue streams.

AB  - In light of the growing energy demand, fossil fuels (e.g., coal, gas or crude oil) continue to play an essential role in meeting the world's energy requirements. Methanol shows great potential both as an energy carrier or as a building block for several products including methyl tert-butyl ether, dimethyl ether, formaldehyde, acetic acid, etc. The current research focuses on methanol production via CO2 hydrogenation since it is the technology with the largest development perspective at commercial scale. The much-needed H2 and CO2 are obtained using chemical looping technologies involving calcium oxide (CaO), iron oxide (Fe2O3), and CaO-CuO as oxygen carriers. The proposed technologies are compared against conventional technology involving the steam methane reforming process for H2 generation, as well against green methanol production (i.e., electrolytic H2 generation using renewable sources). CHEMCAD software is employed to perform the modelling and simulation aspects with all investigated scenarios considering a daily production capacity of 2400 tons of methanol. The environmental analysis is carried out based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology using mass and energy balance data retrieved from process modelling and simulation section. One ton of methanol is set as functional unit. Based on the technical evaluation, even though sorption enhanced reforming (SER) configuration provides the highest H2 efficiency (78.62 %), the iron-based chemical looping (CLH) system offers higher carbon capture rate with similar efficiency (76.61 %). Green methanol manufacturing scores best, getting the lowest effect score in eight out of twelve impact categories; yet, its performance is heavily dependent on the availability of renewable power sources. Of the looping technologies, the use of iron-based chemical looping has the least negative effects in eight of them, including global warming potential (GWP), fossil depletion potential (FDP) and freshwater eutrophication potential (FEP). It is found that, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, direct methanol synthesis using chemical looping technology proves competitive against the traditional natural gas approach.

AB  - Canadian organizations are facing mounting challenges to productivity and survival due to innumerable changes in the new global economy. Of all of the forces directing modern organizational change, technological innovations are among the fastest growing concerns for a psychology of work. In this article, we review the types of technologies being adopted in Canadian firms and assess their influence on the skills and experiences of workers. We conclude that the direction of change for employee performance, use of job skills, and quality of worklife experiences is mediated by the type of innovation adopted and the manner in which it is implemented in the organization. Industrial and organizational psychologists can lead the way in helping organizations and employees benefit from nerv technology by providing empirically based guidelines for strategic implementation of workplace innovations.

AB  - Technological innovations generate knowledge spillovers-non-innovators benefit through the adoption, imitation, and extension of new technologies. International trade facilitates technology diffusion by providing importing countries access to technical knowledge that they can potentially internalize. Previous studies of the effect of trade on technology diffusion typically only consider the impact of direct (bilateral) trade on indirect measures of technology (e.g., total factor productivity). We contend that the analysis of trade's impact on technology diffusion would be more accurately assessed by using direct measures of specific technologies (e.g., intensity levels) and by allowing for the influence of both the direct and indirect effects of trade in the analysis. The latter is accomplished by modeling the international trade system as a weighted network, which quantifies both direct and indirect trade linkages. Combining trade data with data on the adoption of specific technologies, we find that the network effects of trade play a significant role in technology diffusion. In most cases, countries that are better-connected on the trade network have higher technology intensities. Further support for the importance of trade is provided by the finding that for "outdated" technologies, better-connected countries have lower technology intensities because of their adoption of newer, substitute technologies.

AB  - Land use change is a complex process driven by a range of socio-economic and environmental factors. This study investigates the temporal and spatial dynamics of land use change in the Dongting Lake Region of China from 2000 to 2020. Using remote sensing data and advanced modeling techniques, including binary-logistic regression and cellular automaton (CA)-Markov models, the patterns and drivers of land use change in the region were analyzed. It was found that construction land expanded rapidly at the expense of agricultural land, while forest and grassland areas experienced moderate declines. These changes are primarily driven by topographic factors such as slope and elevation, as well as socio-economic factors such as population density and gross domestic product (GDP). Based on these findings, an optimized spatial configuration of land use, derived through an overlay analysis, was obtained under the ecological security framework. This configuration was informed by the simulation results of land use under the CA-Markov model and the optimized zoning results formed by the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model. This study projects future land use patterns in the region up to 2035 and identifies key areas for ecological conservation and sustainable land management. The results of this study provide valuable insights for policymakers and planners seeking to balance economic development with environmental protection in this important region.

AB  - Some knowledge gaps still remain regarding carbon sequestration in non-irrigated agroecosystems, where plants may experience drought stress during summertime. Therefore, by the combination of the eddy covariance (EC) and soil chamber techniques, we determined the role of a non-irrigated grassed vineyard in carbon sequestration in the Slovak Republic. Based on the EC data, the cumulative net uptake of CO2 (NEE) for the whole growing season was weak and was ca. -97 (g C m(-2)). This value resulted from -796 (g C m(-2)) carbon uptake from the atmosphere through photosynthesis (GEE) and 699 (g C m(-2)) carbon released to the atmosphere through respiration (Reco). Carbon emissions through Reco were considerable and accounted for ca. 88% of GEE, which points out the importance of Reco for managing non-irrigated agroecosystems. Data from the soil chamber indicated that ca. 302 g C m(-2) was released by the vineyard through soil respiration (Rsoil) over a growing season, which was constantly lower than Reco and accounted for ca. 44 +/- 18% of Reco. This finding implies that the vineyard soil was not a main source of carbon emissions. Rsoil was mainly driven by temperature (exponentially ca. 69-85%). Meanwhile, vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and temperature appeared to be the most important limiting factors for GEE, NEE, and Reco, particularly when they exceeded a certain threshold (e.g., temperature > 17 degrees C, and VPD > 10 hPa).

AB  - Short-term exposures to air pollution are associated with acute effects on respiratory health. This study aimed to describe 10-year temporal trends in respiratory mortality in the urban areas of Shenyang, China, according to gender and age and estimate the effects of air pollution on respiratory diseases (ICD-10J00-J99) and lung cancer (ICD-10 C33-C34) using a case-crossover design. During the study period 2013-2015, the exposure-response relationship between ambient air pollutants and mortality data was fitted by a quasi-Poisson model. Age-standardized mortality rates for a combined number of respiratory diseases and for lung cancer declined in Shenyang; however, death counts increased with aging. Deaths from respiratory diseases increased by 4.7% (95% CI, 0.00-9.9), and lung cancer mortality increased by 6.5% (95% CI, 1.2-12.0), both associated with a 10 mu g/m(3) increase in exposure to particulate matter < 2.5 mu g in diameter (PM2.5). Moreover, males in Shenyang's urban areas were more susceptible to the acute effects of PM2.5 and SO2 exposure; people aged >= 65 years had a high susceptibility to ozone, and those aged < 65 years were more susceptible to other air pollutants. These results provided an updated estimate of the short-term effects of air pollution in Shenyang. Since population aging is also associated with increasing mortality from respiratory diseases and lung cancer, reinforcing air quality control measures and health-promoting behaviors is urgent and necessary in Shenyang.

AB  - Carbon sequestration (C-seq) in soils and plant biomass is viewed as an important means of mitigating climate change. Recent global assessments have estimated considerable potential for terrestrial C-seq, but generally lack sensitivity to climate warming, nutrient limitations and perspective on local land use. These are important factors since higher temperatures can accelerate the decomposition of soil organic matter, nutrient availability affects plant productivity, while land use pressures put broader constraints on terrestrial organic matter inputs and storage. Here, we explore the potential for C-seq under changing land use, climate and nutrient conditions in a UK-based national scale case study. We apply an integrated terrestrial C-N-P cycle model with representative ranges of high-resolution climate and land use scenarios to estimate C-seq potential across the UK. If realistic UK targets for grassland restoration and afforestation over the next 30 years are met, we estimate that an additional 120 TgC could be sequestered by 2100 (similar to current annual UK greenhouse gas emissions or roughly 7% of net emission cuts needed in meeting net zero), conditional on climate change of <2 degrees C. Conversely, we estimate that UK arable expansion would reduce terrestrial carbon storage by a similar magnitude. The most pessimistic climate trajectories are predicted to cause net losses in UK soil carbon storage under all land use scenarios. Warmer climates substantially reduce the potential total terrestrial carbon storage gains offered by afforestation and grassland restoration. We conclude that although concerted land use change could make an important moderate contribution to national level C-seq for countries like the UK, soil C-seq only provides a contribution if we are on a low emission pathway, and is therefore conditional on deep global cuts to emissions from fossil fuels, deforestation and soil degradation.

AB  - "Bury Your Gays" is the popular name used to describe the common television trope in which characters who are ostensibly gender- or sexually-diverse are denied happy endings or "killed off". Widespread online commentary among audiences reacting to incidents of "Bury Your Gays" are indicative of a public concern over the repetitiveness of this trope in contemporary popular culture. This paper investigates the cultural frameworks through which television producers respond to audience anger at "Bury Your Gays" incidents in order to provide a production perspective to scholarship on the topic. We compare two cases separated by a generation: the 2002 case of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the 2016 case of The 100. We argue that the difference in responses is indicative of (i) a solidification of the producer-audience relationship since the advent of social media; (ii) the further embedding of a transactional approach to viewership in which "queerbaiting" is considered "false advertising" and (iii) the growth of cancel culture which fosters expectations that television representation will align with positive depictions and socially-progressive cultural values. The paper argues that these cultural shifts underscore the way in which producers respond, no longer justifying the death of a queer character based on narrative need, but now balanced with attention to audience identity and social demand.

AB  - Despite the importance of as comprehensive as possible damage cost estimates to cost benefit analyses of global attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, few researchers have attempted to monetize the direct impact of climate change on households. This study uses the hedonic technique to measure the amenity value of the climate to German households. Evidence suggests that the amenity value of climate variables is capitalized mainly into hedonic house price differentials. Overall, German households appear to prefer warmer winters with less rainfall. Combining estimates of amenity values with the predicted changes in climate associated with the IPCCs A2 emissions scenario we find that the overall impact of climate change on German households, whilst negative, is typically not statistically different from zero. This occurs in part because the prediction is for warmer but wetter winters and also because the amenity value of some climate variables cannot be measured with sufficient precision.

AB  - Objectives The purpose of this study was to examine the association between food insecurity and untreated dental caries using a nationally representative sample of US adults. Methods Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cycles 2011-2012 and 2013-2014 on adults aged 18 years and older were analysed (n = 10 723). Primary predictors were overall food security (food-secure/ food-insecure) and household food security (full, marginal, low and very low). The main outcome was any untreated dental caries (none/ >= one). Multiple logistic regression analyses were done to estimate the adjusted odds ratio after controlling for confounders. Results Food-insecure adults were more likely to have untreated dental caries than food-secure adults after adjusting for potential confounders (OR: 1.2; 95% CI: 0.9-1.5). Adults from households with marginal (OR:1.4; 95% CI:1.5-2.2), low (OR:1.3, 95% CI:1.3-2.0) and very low food security (OR:1.3; 95% CI:0.9-1.5) had higher odds of untreated caries than adults from households with full food security. Following age stratification, marginal, low and very low food-secure adults had higher prevalence of untreated dental caries than full food-secure adults across all age groups. Conclusions Our findings suggest that food-insecure adults had higher odds of untreated dental caries than food-secure adults. These findings highlight the importance of assessing food insecurity as a risk factor for dental caries. Longitudinal cohort studies are recommended to determine causal mechanisms.

AB  - Numerous policy tools could be employed in attempting to mitigate climate change through reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Direct cost imposition through the taxation of carbon content of fossil fuels has long enjoyed support from diverse policy analysts but has proven highly difficult to advance politically in the United States and many other nations. This article considers the evolving American experience in climate policy tool selection, including extended engagement by many states over the past decade and growing federal involvement in recent Congresses. It demonstrates the enduring aversion to direct cost imposition as opposed to other policy options. This includes a brief period in late 2008 and early 2009 when prospects for direct cost imposition heightened markedly at the federal level but collapsed quickly in favor of a melange of other approaches that are likely to be less efficient but also less direct in their imposition of costs. The article concludes with considerations of other methods to advance direct cost imposition in the American case.

AB  - The Brazilian sugarcane industry is well positioned to comply with sustainability criteria being defined in the EU and the supply market with proven sustainable fuel ethanol. A number of measures already in place in Brazil ensure minimum required savings in greenhouse gas emissions and observance of land use restrictions. Initiatives such as the Green Protocol in the State of Sao Paulo, the UNICA-FERAESP protocol and the RenovAcao program include social considerations and are vital for the Brazilian sugarcane industry to demonstrate the sustainability of its production. The national program AgroEcological Zoning for Sugarcane, introduced by the federal government, ensures land use restrictions are applied well beyond EU requirements. The proliferation of sustainability schemes is counterproductive insofar it discourages investments in developing countries, with negative consequences for early implementers of criteria of the Renewable Energy Sources Directive.

AB  - This research aims to discuss the business model themes supported by the innovation regarding the sustainable transition difficulties to promote the hospital supply chains. A model for future applications and empirical analyzes in the health service area is proposed. In the current hospital scenario, the systems are characterized by the individualistic attention of the closed business models, hampering the promotion of the business models, the innovation, and the sustainable transitions as the sustainable supply chain (SSC) enablers. The survey evaluates the private hospital chain in Brazil. The model was evaluated by seven specialists indicated by the main private Brazilian hospitals that are accredited by Joint Commission International and Public Ministry. The discussion presented seeks to advance the observation and the understanding of the relationships among the business models, the innovation, the sustainable transitions, and the sustainable supply chains in the health socioeconomic context through the lens of the service provider, without exhausting these themes separately. The main results are the issues related to the difficulties of sustainable transition to promote the SSC in the hospital context, showing the elements into which the hospitals are inserted and helping to close the gap in the literature on the subject. Sustainable transitions, along with the SSC, present themselves as rich and challenging themes, but are beneficial for conducting dialogues between approaches.

AB  - Apocalyptic predictions on the world's future after COVID-19 are unfounded. Structures of global governance can be reinforced through greater subsidiarity; that is, by enhancing the participation of local authorities, by the involvement of civil society and the private sector and by regionalising initiatives, where appropriate. Furthermore, globalisation's scope should be extended to comprise the shared governance of all global public goods and elements affecting human security. This essay outlines how this transformation could work for the four policy areas of global trade, food security, public health and climate change.

AB  - Estimating the health burden of air pollution against the background of population aging is of great significance for achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 3.9 which aims to substantially reduce the deaths and illnesses from air pollution. Here, we estimated spatiotemporal changes in deaths attributable to PM2.5 air pollution in China from 2000 to 2035 and examined the drivers. The results show that from 2019 to 2035, deaths were projected to decease 15.4% (6.6%-20.7%, 95% CI) and 8.4% (0.6%-13.5%) under the SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 scenario, respectively, but increase 10.4% (5.1%-20.5%) and 18.1% (13.0%-28.3%) under SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0 scenarios. Population aging will be the leading contributor to increased deaths attributable to PM2.5 air pollution, which will counter the positive gains achieved by improvements in air pollution and healthcare. Region-specific measures are required to mitigate the health burden of air pollution and this requires long-term efforts and mutual cooperation among regions in China. Estimating health burden of air pollution against the background of population aging is of significance for achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3.9. Here, the authors show that population aging is expected to be the leading contributor to increased deaths attributable to PM2.5 in China by 2035, which will counter the positive gains achieved by improvements in air pollution and healthcare.

AB  - In recent decades, the commodification of the English language has aroused intensive research interest in the sociolinguistics on a global scale, but studies on the commodification of the Chinese language are relatively rare. Most studies take a critical approach in relation to its adverse impacts on minority rights and social justice. This study examined the language landscape in Chiangmai, Thailand, and the linguistic beliefs of local Thai Chinese language learners. Based on their feedback, this study investigated the commodification of Chinese language education in the community of Chinese language learners in Chiangmai. We found that from a less critical perspective, the commodification of a second language provides more accessible and affordable educational opportunities for learners, especially those from low-income families, and at the same time language proficiency can broaden learners' career choices and provide employees with additional value in industries, such as tourism, commerce, and services. This finding implies that language commodification, rather than typically being associated with linguistic imperialism and unbalanced socio-economic status, can be a contributing factor in promoting higher-education availability and social sustainability in certain circumstances. There may be some mediating factors between the commodification of language and changes in the sustainable balance of language, opening up space for future research to explore.

Both the theoretical arguments and the empirical evidence are considered. It is found that: i) Several studies support a negative impact of corruption on growth (sand the wheel hypothesis), but there are also studies supporting a positive impact (grease the wheels hypothesis); ii) Concerning the impact of corruption on foreign direct investment, the evidence is also mixed since there are studies supporting a negative effect (the "grabbing hand" view), a positive effect (the "helping hand" view), and even no significant effect; iii) The great majority of studies find that corruption generates more income inequality, although some studies find an inverse relationship in regions where the informal sector is large; iv) There is a strong consensus regarding that corruption hampers human development by affecting aspects like poverty, education and health; v) Most of studies show that there is a direct association between corruption and the natural resources sector, especially in the mining, oil and gas industries. In addition, research challenges of economics of corruption in aspects like the definition of corruption, multidisciplinary perspective, econometric specification, and data issues are discussed.

AB  - This article addresses the question of how forestry projects, given the recently improved standards for the accounting of carbon sequestration, can benefit from existing and emerging carbon markets in the world. For a long time, forestry projects have been set up for the purpose of generating carbon credits. They were surrounded by uncertainties about the permanence of carbon sequestration in trees, potential replacement of deforestation due to projects (leakage), and how and what to measure as sequestered carbon. Through experience with Joint Implementation (JI) and Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) forestry projects, albeit limited, and with forestry projects in voluntary carbon markets, considerable improvements have been made with accounting of carbon sequestration in forests, resulting in a more solid basis for carbon credit trading. The scope of selling these credits exists both in compliance markets, although currently with strong limitations, and in voluntary markets for offsetting emissions with carbon credits. Improved carbon accounting methods for forestry investments can also enhance the scope for forestry in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that countries must prepare under the Paris Agreement.

AB  - Traditional-homegardens are important for the food security, economy, and culture of rural communities, but also contributing to biodiversity conservation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of traditional-homegardens as a refuge for birds, how the birds used them, and which of their attributes were associated with the frequency of bird visits. We compared the percentage of visits among groups of birds by habitat preference. Also, we compared the frequency of visits to different vegetation strata and the use that birds made within traditional-homegardens (forage, perching or nesting). Finally, we analyzed the relationship between the number of visits and some characteristics of the traditional-homegardens (size area, richness of large plants and distance to the nearest forest fragment). Birds visited different vegetation stratum of traditional-homegardens to perch, to forage, and even to nest. In general, we found that larger traditional-homegardens area increased the number of bird visits, while distance to the native forest fragments and the species richness of large plants did not have significant effects. Insectivores and frugivores had a similar pattern to the general; to the granivores, the distance to the forest fragment had a positive effect on the number of visits; to the omnivores, the species richness of large plants had negative effect, to the nectarivores, none of the variables had a significant effect. Overall, this study sheds light on the significance of traditional-homegardens not only for human communities but also for biodiversity conservation by providing valuable habitats for a variety of bird species.

AB  - Theories of endogenous economic growth propose that the exchange of information between workers with different knowledge facilitates innovation. In this study, we explore whether occupational gender segregation poses a barrier to endogenous growth by limiting the extent to which women and men workers exchange information, ideas and perspectives. Focusing on technology industries as a sector where information exchange plays a large role, we use error correction models to test for the potential long-term costs of occupational gender segregation on industry growth and productivity across US local labor markets from 2005 through 2019. Results indicate that occupational gender segregation stalls tech growth, while also hindering productivity. Conversely stated, the occupational integration of women and men provides a boon to growth and productivity in local tech sectors. As regions strive to be competitive in the new economy, those fostering collaboration between women and men will be better positioned to succeed.

AB  - The main objective of the present study is to examine the determinants of greenhouse gas emissions in Canada using panel data of 10 provinces from 1990 to 2019. The pooled ordinary least squares method is used to estimate the models. The main findings of the basic model show that provinces with larger populations, younger ages, and more income produce higher levels of greenhouse gas emissions. The results of the extended model (per capita greenhouse gas emissions as the dependent variable) show that only five factors (out of ten potential determinants identified)-oil production per capita, gas production per capita, motor vehicles registered per capita, electricity generation intensity, and heating degree days-are significant determinants of per capita greenhouse gas emissions. The results also reveal that the provinces with older populations have lower per capita greenhouse gas emissions in Canada. However, both trend variables played an important role in explaining the greenhouse gas emissions per capita in Canada. Moreover, there were no significant differences among the patterns of the per capita greenhouse gas emissions in Canada after 2005.

Using German survey data and controlling for local differences in climate and energy prices, I show that retrofitted heating systems run significantly longer on a typical winter weekday than non-retrofitted ones. In particular lower-income households seem to respond to heating retrofits by increasing the heating time. My findings provide further evidence for the existence of direct rebound effects and have some important implications for energy and climate policy.

AB  - Although transportation systems are an increasing necessity in today's connected world, the over-reliance on internal combustion engine vehicles has caused an increase in air and noise pollution. Air and noise pollutions are among the negative environmental factors that contribute to disease occurrence due to their negative health consequences. Literature has showed that air and noise pollutions were responsible for thousands of premature deaths in Europe. This has pushed scientists to search for models to calculate the effect of traffic on air and noise pollution, to help predict future scenarios, and to work on ways to mitigate that increase in pollution. In this paper, a statistical model is done by using data measured for 25 speed bump locations in Kuwait, which included traffic flow data in the form of vehicle count and classification, as well as noise level measurements taken through an Amprobe SM20 sound meter, in addition to air pollutant data obtained from the Environment Public Authority (EPA) in Kuwait. The results of the multivariate linear regression model showed that high traffic counts resulted in significantly higher noise levels, reaching more than 70 decibels in certain locations, which is considered unhealthy for extended time periods. The model also showed that sulfur dioxide levels were impacted by both light and heavy vehicles, while particulate matter less than 10 mu m was affected mainly by heavy vehicles. An online survey on speed bumps was completed by 803 participants to understand the behavior of people at speed bumps in Kuwait and understand if age and gender might be a predictor of how people would behave, and this was done by doing Pearson's chi-squared correlation tests on the results obtained from the survey.

AB  - The study reported here was to determine the effect of an application of organic and mineral materials and their mixtures, combined with mineral fertiliser regime, on the content of selected macroelements in cocksfoot grass and maize. The trial was a completely randomised arrangement with three replicates. Two experimental factors were tested: factor A - fertilisation with organic and mineral materials (sewage sludge fresh and composted, hard coal incineration ashes, calcium carbonate, mixture of this components) and factor B - mineral fertilisation. The observed effects are indicative of the legitimacy of applying sewage sludge and its mixture with hard coal ash to fertilise agricultural crops as this would reduce reliance on mineral fertiliser, which is very desirable in sustainable agriculture. Mineral fertilisation applied to both the test plants significantly reduced their contents of calcium and magnesium but it increased their content of potassium.

AB  - As the world's largest ceramics producer and exporter, China's ceramic industry is being sharply watched because of excessive resource consumption and pressing environmental issues. Given the specific performances of the ceramic production system, a full set of improved emergy indicators have been adopted to assess environmental sustainability. By taking a typical building ceramic tile plant as an example, this paper conducted a case study, including emergy analysis, ecological indicators, sensitivity analysis, and industrial pollutant emergy analysis (exhaust gas, wastewater, and solid waste). The results demonstrate that (1) non-renewable resource accounts for 57.7% of the total emergy amount and is the primary factor for the emergy analysis; (2) clay is the major contributor to non-renewable resource emergy (26% of the entire emergy; (3) emergy sustainability index is 0.041, which displays poor environmental sustainability; (4) the unit emergy value of building ceramic tile plant is 4.01E+12 sej/kg in the paper; (5) sensitivity analysis results of two assumptions illustrate the non-renewable resources has the biggest fluctuation (5.77%) in hypothesis 1 and the clay (2.63%) have the dominant status in hypothesis 2; (6) the solid waste is the major contributor and accounts for 3.69% of the entire emergy and 95.56% of the industrial pollutant emergy. In light of comprehensive discussions, two positive measures are proposed to improve environmental sustainability, containing enhancing the proportion of renewable energy input and recycling material replacement, respectively.

AB  - The introduction and adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs) will likely reshape the transportation system and many economic activities. The economic literature on technology adoption, based on studies in agriculture and other sectors, provides lessons on the diffusion of AVs and its social and economic impacts. We rely on the threshold model of diffusion, where heterogeneous agents make decisions pursuing their self-interests. Applications of the threshold model point to case studies of other technologies where one can gain information and make predictions about the future of AVs. We find that private ownership of AVs may prevail after a transition period, as was the case in other technologies like computers, tractors, and conventional vehicles. With technological progress, the cost of privately owning AVs may decline. Further, there will be an increase in vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per capita, there may be more vehicles on the road, and perhaps the transportation user-base will expand to include those currently facing limited mobility. Congestion is likely to depend on the tradeoff between the expansion of VMT and increased efficiency of AVs to communicate and help regulate traffic. Furthermore, differentiation of vehicles will increase as driving time becomes freed for other activities. These trends may lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions and expansion of the transportation sector. Finally, the technology will evolve and may result in complementary innovations needing to be addressed, including the "last 10 feet" problem. It is evident that the future of the transportation system governed by AVs is most likely not going to be sustainable. This necessitates the importance of developing and enforcing rigorous policies at the metropolitan level and TNC levels to ensure a sustainable evolution of the future of transportation mobility.

AB  - A review of the present status of the global warming science is presented in this paper. The term global warming is now popularly used to refer to the recent reported increase in the mean surface temperature of the earth; this increase being attributed to increasing human activity and in particular to the increased concentration of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) in the atmosphere. Since the mid to late 1980s there has been an intense and often emotional debate on this topic. The various climate change reports (1996, 2001) prepared by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), have provided the scientific framework that ultimately led to the Kyoto protocol on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (particularly carbon dioxide) due to the burning of fossil fuels. Numerous peer-reviewed studies reported in recent literature have attempted to verify several of the projections on climate change that have been detailed by the IPCC reports. The global warming debate as presented by the media usually focuses on the increasing mean temperature of the earth, associated extreme weather events and future climate projections of increasing frequency of extreme weather events worldwide. In reality, the climate change issue is considerably more complex than an increase in the earth's mean temperature and in extreme weather events. Several recent studies have questioned many of the projections of climate change made by the IPCC reports and at present there is an emerging dissenting view of the global warming science which is at odds with the IPCC view of the cause and consequence of global warming. Our review suggests that the dissenting view offered by the skeptics or opponents of global warming appears substantially more credible than the supporting view put forth by the proponents of global warming. Further, the projections of future climate change over the next fifty to one hundred years is based on insufficiently verified climate models and are therefore not considered reliable at this point in time.

AB  - In the case of plastic waste regulations, this framework ignores that recycling in developing countries is largely undertaken within the unorganised sector. To add to this policies such as Single Use Plastic (SUP) bans disproportionately penalise unorganised sector recycling units and workers employed within them. This paper seeks to identify the global framework of waste minimisation and the lacunae in its implementation in the case of plastic waste in India. This will be based on analysis of national level regulations on plastic waste, court cases in the High Courts of India, and results of a primary field survey of unorganised sector plastic recycling units in Mumbai. By doing so, this paper seeks to explain the importance of recycling as a productive activity, and the need to incorporate concerns of workers and small-scale enterprise owners from the unorganised sector, in order to achieve a just transition to sustainable plastic waste management.

AB  - The relationship between HIV and food security has been characterized by a tendency to view both as primarily rural phenomena. The urban literature, in turn, has been dominated by a biomedical focus on the nutritional implications of HIV infection on people living with HIV (PLHIV). Recently, attention has turned to related issues such as the value of nutrition supplementation, the nutritional implications of anti-retroviral therapy and the impact on both of rising food prices. This paper argues that the focus on rural food insecurity, the individual PLHIV and the nutritional aspects of food security, while valuable and necessary, are limiting our ability to understand the social and economic relationships that are central to the HIV-food security nexus in urban contexts. Rapid urbanization makes food security in the urban context a complex issue with a number of different and overlapping dimensions. Understanding the reciprocal relationship between HIV and urban food security requires a new social framework which incorporates, but is not constrained by, a focus on the nutritional impacts of the epidemic.

Lifecycle assessments of greenhouse gas emissions emanating from hydropower must count embedded carbon, emissions from reservoir lakes and the loss of carbon sinks, as well as backup diesel generation emissions when dependence on hydropower fails to deliver energy. Using Zambia as a case study, we estimate using a bottom-up approach that the emissions associated with backup diesel generation from Zambia's power utility ZESCO and three largest sectors of consumers were up to 27 000 tonnes of CO22, CH4 and N2O emissions and microbial communities in an agricultural soil

AB  - Promising massive emissions reduction and energy savings, the utilization of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in last-mile parcel delivery is continuously expanding. However, the limited UAV range deters their widescale adoption to replace ground modes of transportation. Moreover, real-world data on the impact of different parameters on the operation, emissions, and energy consumption is scarce. This study aims to assess the impact of airspace planning and discretization on the energy consumption of autonomous UAVs. We utilize a novel open-source comprehensive UAV autonomous programming framework and a digital-twin model to simulate real-world three-dimensional operation. The framework integrates airspace policies, UAV kinematics, and autonomy to accurately estimate the operational energy consumption via an experimentally verified energy model. In the simulated case study, airspace is discretized by both a traditional Cartesian method and a novel dynamic 4D discretization (Skyroutes) method. This allows for the comparison of different routing and trajectory planning algorithms for ten missions. The results show a variation in the energy consumption by up to 50%, which demonstrates the criticality of airspace discretization and planning on UAV charging infrastructure design, greenhouse gas emissions reduction, and airspace management.

AB  - Sustainability Development Goals require each country and region to adjust their environmental and social policies to ensure a timely global response, stabilization of climate, and social equality. Vojvodina's area has unique challenges due to its political status and significant dependence on environmental resources to ensure its economy, energy supply and food security. The researchers reviewed potential challenges to Vojvodina's sustainable development based on analysis of long-term trend changes of temperature and water flow. To support sustainable development, Vojvodina region needs to strive for the integral concept of flood protection, which includes harmonization of "human" demands component and "environmental" demands components.

AB  - Climate dictates the critical aspects of human environmental conditions. The frequency and intensity of extreme weather conditions due to human-induced climate change have alarmingly increased. Consequently, climate change directly affects environmental sustainability and human mortality in the short term and creates prolonged and complicated long-term indirect grave risks. This paper examines three-level environmental impact risks associated with climate change on human mortality. It proposes a conceptual framework for developing an empirical event-based human mortality database related to climate change and communication strategies to enhance global environmental adaptation, resilience, and sustainability.

AB  - The production of basic materials accounts for around 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Existing measures to reduce emissions from industry are limited due to a combination of competitiveness concerns and a lack of technological options available to producers. In this paper, we assess the possibility of implementing a materials charge to reduce demand for basic industrial products and, hence, also reduce industrial emission levels. The modelling shows that a charge equivalent to around euro80/tCO(2) could reduce the EU's total (energy plus process) CO2 emissions by up to 10% by 2050, depending on the substitution options available. The materials charge could lead to small GDP increases and a minor reduction in overall employment levels.

AB  - Income inequality and economic complexity impacts on ecological footprint were researched for a panel of twenty-five countries, from 1970 to 2016, using the panel quantile regression approach. Results support that the economic complexity index in the 10th and 25th quantiles and pooled OLS regression positively affects ecological footprint, but not in the 75th and 90th quantiles. Gross Domestic Product in the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th quantiles have a positive effect on ecological footprint. Consumption of fossil fuels and population growth positively affects the ecological footprint in 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th quantiles and the pooled OLS. Income inequality in the 10th, 25th, and 50th quantiles and the OLS model regression positively affect ecological footprint. Economic openness in 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th quantiles and the pooled OLS negatively affect ecological footprint. Policymakers should promote policies to (i) encourage investment in green energy technologies and implement upgraded energy and environmental laws; (ii) diversify exports and sophisticate products in countries with a high ecological footprint; (iii) depth of human development to control for the population growth and stimulate the economic complexity; (vi) negotiate international trade agreements to open the economy; (v) implement measures to curb income inequality.

AB  - This research aims to investigate the potential impact of national policies on the attainment of Europe's goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Specifically, it analyses the effects of policies on the power sector, by evaluating capacity expansion portfolios, import reliance, and costs by 2050. A linear programming model, the IESA-EUPS, is utilized to optimize the expansion and operation of the power system, considering 28 nodes and hourly temporal resolution. The study includes five scenarios from 2020 to 2050, with varying levels of biomass and nuclear penetration based on existing member state policies. Results show that by 2050, changes mainly occur in the interplay between firm capacities and cross-border transmission levels. Limiting biomass can significantly increase nuclear energy generation, while enforcing all policies leads to a 40 % rise in cross-border transmission by 2050, due to imbalances between countries. Some member states, such as Spain and Finland, are less affected, whereas others are heavily reliant on firm nuclear capacities. Western European countries with strict biomass and nuclear restrictions may see a boost in nuclear installations in countries allowing it. Member states without both nuclear and biomass may rely more on variable renewables, resulting in surplus electricity and increased LCOE.

AB  - The role of various organizational pressures in influencing performance of firms has been an interesting research topic in a variety of fields and has received the attention of researchers working in the field of environmental strategy. Although there are previous studies that have looked at the influence of various pressures in influencing firms' environmental strategies, our study provides a more holistic analysis considering a variety of such pressures in a single framework. We discuss a research study to analyze how pressures from internal and external stakeholders of a firm, economic pressures, environmental regulations, and pressures of environmental compliance have affected environmental performance of firms using data collected from manufacturing firms in the United Kingdom. We have found that internal stakeholders provide the greatest impact in shaping environmental performance of firms, closely followed by economic pressures, environmental regulations, and external stakeholders in that order. Fears of penalties due to environmental compliance have the least impact, although this pressure also has a positive and significant impact on environmental performance.

AB  - In a dataset on 83 countries covering the years 1960-2009, we find a negative indirect effect of the share of renewable natural capital in wealth on economic growth transmitted through demographic factors, more specifically, population fertility. In contrast, in countries with lower income inequality and higher institutional quality, the share of non-renewable natural capital in wealth has a direct positive impact on growth. We also find that countries with higher income per capita, human development, and institutional quality have a higher share of renewable natural capital per capita, but a lower share of renewable natural capital in wealth. Renewable natural capital is thus valuable for the population and of primary concern for empowered countries, even though it contributes less to wealth and economic growth. Our results raise serious questions about the way wealth and growth are defined in economics when one investigates the impact of natural capital and point to the importance of preserving natural capital, particularly, in less developed countries.

AB  - In order to analyse the impact of land use change, it is particularly important to know how organisms use resources distributed across a heterogeneous landscape. The main objective of this study is to analyse the potential impact of land use change on bird and mammal fauna, by using a coupled model approach. The CLUE (Conversion of Land Use and its Effects) model has been applied to obtain the spatial pattern of land use change for a scenario with soybean expansion in the Cerrado of Maranhao State in Brazil. These land use change maps were used as the input for the LEDESS (Landscape Ecological Decision and Evaluation Support System) model to evaluate the impact of habitat fragmentation on mammal and bird species. The scenarios demonstrated that high quality habitat for all studied species will be lost in the future when current trends in agricultural expansion continue, but these changes will have species-specific impacts. The most relevant ecological impact under the explored scenarios was habitat fragmentation expressed by the increase the number of habitat clusters. The coupled model approach of LEDESS and CLUE made it possible to project the spatial impact of soybean expansion on habitat dynamics in the studied region. This model approach can help to design effective ecological infrastructure to facilitate species survival and to implement an effective habitat network in the Balsas region.

The problem of the imbalance of the world's food systems and, consequently, the change in the production model in low-income countries is substantiated. It is proposed to study the impact of the war between Russia and Ukraine on the world's food security, in particular: to outline the main stages of the formation of Ukraine as a guarantor of food security in the world food system; to determine the impact of the war on the production and export of agricultural goods; to analyse the food situation in developing and low-income countries; to model the impact of inflation on the food security in developing and low-income countries; to form scenarios for ensuring Ukraine's food security in the short- and long-term periods. Food inflation rate, Core Consumer Price Index and Consumer Price Index have been selected for the analysis of the inflationary impact.

AB  - A programme of field experiments at the Pontbren catchment in Wales has, since autumn 2004, been examining the effects of land use change on flooding. The Pontbren catchment possesses a long history of artificial drainage of its clay soils and intensification of sheep farming. Increased flood runoff has been noted within the last decades, as has the mitigating effect of trees at field scale. To examine the local and catchment-scale effects of land management within the catchment, including the potential advantages of planting additional trees, a multidimensional physically based model has been developed and conditioned on data from an intensely instrumented hillslope. The model is used to examine the effects of planting a small strip of trees within a hillslope. Results demonstrate that careful placement of such interventions can reduce magnitudes of flood peaks by 40% at the field scale. The challenges associated with upscaling these results to the Pontbren and Upper Severn catchments are discussed.

AB  - Understanding the impacts of climate and land use changes driven by urbanization upon ecosystem services (ESs) has great importance in ES management and policy making. However, knowledge of their impacts on ESs correlation and bundles are still lacking. This study quantified five ESs in a spatially explicit manner for 1989-2017 in the City Belt along the Yellow River in Ningxia, China. Ten scenarios based on two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP 2.6 and 8.5) and five urban expansion policies, were used to predict the potential change of ESs in 2017-2045. Temporal trade-off and synergy relations among ESs were analyzed using correlation analysis, while ES bundles were delineated and mapped through a self-organizing map. Results indicated that climate change has larger impacts on sand fixation and carbon sequestration, especially in mountain areas. In 2017-2045, RCP 8.5 would result in a larger increase in sand fixation (by 1.75 times to 2045) and a slight decrease in carbon sequestration (by 1.62%) than RCP 2.6. Land use change has a more substantial impact on the other three ESs than climate change, especially in the central plain. Specifically, cropland reclamation during 1989-2017 and urban expansion in 2017-2045 caused the most intense alterations in ESs. Reclamation can increase food production and nutrient retention, but reduce recreational opportunity, while urban expansion has the opposite impacts. Encouraging compact urban growth, creating riparian vegetation buffers and environment protection policies can effectively reduce the trade-offs and simultaneous losses among ESs. Specific recommendations are proposed for different sub-regions indicated by the ES bundle classification. Our results can provide references for urban planning to enhance ESs under future global warming.

AB  - The impacts of population growth and agglomeration development on urbanization are complex. They cannot be effectively disentangled by simple fixed-effect regression analyses. This study introduces the land use intensity (LUI) metric to measure urbanization, and further applies quantile and threshold regression models to examine the impacts of population (POP) and agglomeration development (AGD) on land use intensity using a sample of 297 Chinese cities. The results reveal the heterogeneous effects that POP and AGD have on LUI. Variation is also observed in the effects of POP and AGD on LUI by POP/AGD intervals. As POP increases, its pressure on LUI increases. In contrast, the accumulative effects of development are beneficial in restraining overdevelopment of land resources within a specific range. The findings suggest that understanding complex human and development effects provides valuable insights, references, and implications for urban development and land use policies, which can guide cities with greater potential land development space in reducing the risk of unsustainable urbanization. Policies are recommended for ecological construction, city grouping, and sustainable land use.

AB  - This paper assesses the implications of climate policy for exposure to water resources stresses. It compares a Reference scenario which leads to an increase in global mean temperature of 4 degrees C by the end of the 21st century with a Mitigation scenario which stabilises greenhouse gas concentrations at around 450 ppm CO(2)e and leads to a 2 degrees C increase in 2100. Associated changes in river runoff are simulated using a global hydrological model, for four spatial patterns of change in temperature and rainfall. There is a considerable difference in hydrological change between these four patterns, but the percentages of change avoided at the global scale are relatively robust. By the 2050s, the Mitigation scenario typically avoids between 16 and 30% of the change in runoff under the Reference scenario, and by 2100 it avoids between 43 and 65%. Two different measures of exposure to water resources stress are calculated, based on resources per capita and the ratio of withdrawals to resources. Using the first measure, the Mitigation scenario avoids 8-17% of the impact in 2050 and 20-31% in 2100; with the second measure, the avoided impacts are 5-21% and 15-47% respectively. However, at the same time, the Mitigation scenario also reduces the positive impacts of climate change on water scarcity in other areas. The absolute numbers and locations of people affected by climate change and climate policy vary considerably between the four climate model patterns. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, their influence on human well-being and health is rarely studied. In China, during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic (Peak), people were very concerned about health, while at the same time wetland parks which are generally considered beneficial to health were closed. Thus, this study explores the public's perception of the health effects of visiting wetland parks and the impact of the pandemic on the perception. From March 5th to 8th, 2020, before the Peak in China was over, 1,400 respondents participated in a nationwide online survey. It was found that the perceived benefits from visiting wetland parks were higher in terms of mental health than in physical health. Also, the perceived health benefits of wetland parks after the Peak were slightly higher than before the pandemic. The results highlight that wildlife habitat services were considered to be the most important ecosystem services that promote the perceived health benefits. Interestingly, the perceived health benefits of wetland parks by health experts appear to be lower than in other groups, indicating that the health benefits of visiting wetland parks may be overestimated by lay-people or underestimated by health experts. The results provide empirical evidence for managing ecosystem services as delivered by these urban wetlands, in the context of COVID-19 or potential future pandemics, for promoting public health.

AB  - The air travel industry, which is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, has placed environmental concerns at the forefront of its operations and marketing efforts. This study aims to examine the influence of environmental knowledge on green purchase intention while considering the mediating effect of green attitude. To this end, conceptual model was tested using the partial least squares path modelling (PLS-PM) technique and ADANCO, with 156 valid responses from Turkey collected via a structured questionnaire administered to passengers. The results indicated that both environmental knowledge and green attitude have positive and significant impacts on green purchase intention. Additionally, green attitude mediates the relationship between environmental knowledge and green purchase intention. These findings suggest that an increase in consumers' environmental knowledge has both direct and indirect effects on their inclination to purchase environmentally friendly air travel products.

AB  - The nexus between poverty and climate change is a major concern, especially in a country like Bangladesh where lack of resources is a significant problem in both rural and urban areas. Climate change affects a wide demographic of the population in Bangladesh, and among those affected, women are more vulnerable to climate change impacts, as is evident from the history of climate-induced disasters in the country. Climate change increases women's socio-economic vulnerabilities by directly impacting their family's food security, water consumption, and livelihood. Hence, their roles and contributions are critical in responding through adaptation. Nonetheless, in Bangladesh, challenges remain to incorporate women as distinct actors and active agents in climate adaptation programs considering the gender power dynamics that exist. In this context, this study focuses on women's contributions as individuals or as a group and reveals their significant influence in climate change adaptation practices.

AB  - Energy consumption is one of the principal components of the operative costs incurred by providers of water services, both financial and environmental. Fortunately, in recent years solar panel technology has improved substantially, and photovoltaic self-consumption has become a tool that can reduce the costs of water reuse and other water services. Regions with a scarcity of water resources make a considerable use of non-conventional sources, consuming a significant amount of energy, which has a high financial and environmental cost and compromises the sustainability of the water supply. This research analyses the possibility of replacing part of this energy with self-consumption through photovoltaic panels based on data obtained for the Region of Valencia in order to analyse the impact of energy substitution on energy costs. Performing a Cost-Benefit Analysis, self-consumption projects require an electricity market price of between 0.14 and 0.18 EUR/kWh, so in financial terms it is not a particularly attractive alternative. However, the avoided greenhouse gas emissions have a high value, and including them in the calculations, the price needed to be in feasible amounts of 0.04-0.10 EUR/kWh for a small installation and 0.02-0.08 EUR/kWh for a large one. In other words, photovoltaic self-consumption is still today an alternative with financial difficulties, but the associated environmental benefit justifies public intervention as it is a beneficial energy alternative in a context of high greenhouse gas emissions.

AB  - Since it would be unwise to apply an environmental measure before its impact is estimated, tools are needed to simulate the system to which the measure is applied. In this paper, a tool and a methodology are discussed in order to simulate scenarios for demand and supply side options and to quantify the emissions and the energy use related to electricity generation. To supply the electricity demand, the composition of the active power system evidently changes with the variations in demand. The instantaneous composition of the power system is determined by the activation order (set by a chosen criterion) of all power plants. Because of their specific nature, some problems are dealt with separately in the model. Pumping plants are both customer (pump-mode) and provider (turbine-mode) of electric power. Therefore, they are not modeled as other plants, but as an adaptation in the demand pattern for other plants. Outages are mostly unpredictable but very important for the instantaneous energy use and emissions. Therefore, the model contains a component in which an average outage schedule can be calculated. The possible deviation of this average result is dealt with in the calculation of the uncertainties. Also, other parameters, like accidental unavailability of plants, human decisions in activation and deactivation of plants and the unpredictable availability of cogeneration units, are included in the calculation of the uncertainties. A simulation tool is necessary, because a-priori "linear" estimates do not always appear to be accurate. Results are highly dependent on the composition of the power system and the activation order of the individual plants. Demand and supply side actions are therefore simulated. Simulations for Belgium have pointed out that variations in electricity-related greenhouse-gas emissions (per unit of electricity generated) can be larger than a factor two, depending on the time segment in which the electricity is consumed. For SOx and NOx emissions this variation can be even larger. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rangelands can be managed to increase soil carbon and help mitigate emissions of carbon dioxide. This study assessed Utah rangeland owner's environmental values, beliefs about climate change, and awareness of and attitudes towards carbon sequestration, as well as their perceptions of potential policy strategies for promoting carbon sequestration on private rangelands. Data were collected from semi-structured interviews and a statewide survey of Utah rangeland owners, and were analyzed using descriptive and bivariate statistics. Over two-thirds of respondents reported some level of awareness of carbon sequestration and a generally positive attitude towards it, contrasting to their lack of interest in participating in a relevant program in the future. Having a positive attitude was statistically significantly associated with having more "biocentric" environmental values, believing the climate had been changing over the past 30 years, and having a stronger belief of human activities influencing the climate. Respondents valued the potential ecological benefits of carbon sequestration more than the potential financial or climate change benefits. Additionally, respondents indicated a preference for educational approaches over financial incentives. They also preferred to work with a private agricultural entity over a non-profit or government entity on improving land management practices to sequester carbon. These results suggest potential challenges for developing technically sound and socially acceptable policies and programs for promoting carbon sequestration on private rangelands. Potential strategies for overcoming these challenges include emphasizing the ecological benefits associated with sequestering carbon to appeal to landowners with ecologically oriented management objectives, enhancing the cooperation between private agricultural organizations and government agencies, and funneling resources for promoting carbon sequestration into existing land management and conservation programs that may produce carbon benefits.

AB  - "Sustainability" is a controversial term for its implied willingness to support an unworkable system. The analysis of its contradictions leads us to a horizon of "downshifting" that, far from specific technological innovations, demands global cultural solutions. This urgency, in addition to the crisis of modernism and its legitimation of artistic autonomy and futility, has encouraged contextual art practices. Practices that often advocate a direct relationship with the "real" without the mediation of artistic formalities. Neglecting these elements of mediation and those areas of autonomy may, however, not only hamper the necessary reinterpretation and reassessment of the "real" achievement of the system but also to give fuel to functionalism and distort the processes of cultural differentiation.

AB  - Background: This study examines environmental justice (EJ) indicators in communities surrounding 165 prisons in 10 U.S. states, contributing to timely and critical discussions of both decarceration and EJ in smaller towns and rural areas of the United States.Methods: Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping Tool (EJSCREEN) was used to characterize environmental burdens in communities surrounding state and federal prisons. Based on findings, brief case studies of five prison communities with multiple EJ concerns are presented.Results: Communities surrounding 40% of the prisons exceeded an 80th percentile threshold EJ Index for one indicator; nearly one-quarter exceeded this threshold for multiple EJ Indexes. The prisons tended to be in less-densely populated areas; only 4% of prisons in these 10 states were in cities. States with higher incarceration rates tended to have a greater number of elevated EJ Indexes for communities surrounding prisons.Discussion: Findings support the existence of many rural EJ communities, and a multitude of pollution sources may contribute to environmental conditions in communities surrounding prisons. Although EJ concerns impact a broad set of stakeholders, prison inmates represent a unique population: involuntary subjects of environmental burdens they are unable to escape during the period of their incarceration. Study findings are also discussed in the context of proposed actions under the Biden Administration's Justice40 Initiative.Conclusion: Intersectional approaches are needed to understand and solve complex problems. This study finds that rural communities, increasingly the sites of prisons, present EJ concerns worthy of further examination.

AB  - Individual behavior plays a pivotal role in mitigating climate change but our understanding of the multifaceted, determining factors of sustainable behavior remains incomplete. Here we conducted a comprehensive, cross-sectional survey of German households in 2021 (N = 10,813), assessing various potential determinants and measuring behavior in greenhouse gas emissions across various life domains (shelter, mobility, consumption, and diet). Machine learning models were employed to predict emissions from determining factors and benchmarked against commonly used linear models. Our findings indicate that machine learning models excel in capturing complex relationships between personal and situational factors, offering a more nuanced understanding of how determinants interplay and contribute to emissions. Notably, some factors like perceived behavioral control or habits consistently affected emissions, while others like infrastructural barriers and pro-environmental attitudes were domain-specific. These insights about key determinants of sustainable behavior are valuable for policymakers crafting effective climate change strategies at the individual level. The behavioral factors responsible for individual greenhouse gas emissions in Germany interact and differ mainly across life domains such as mobility and diet, suggests a machine learning-based analysis of cross-sectional survey among German households.

AB  - A transition to low-carbon energy sources is pivotal in addressing the escalating challenges of climate change and environmental degradation. Solar energy, particularly photovoltaic (PV) technology, stands out as a prominent solution because of its potential for clean and sustainable electricity generation with minimal greenhouse gas emissions. However, accurately assessing the carbon footprint of PV modules is essential for guiding policy, industry practices, and research. This paper reviews the state of the current literature and highlights the difficulties in estimating the carbon footprint of PV modules manufactured in China. It emphasises the inherent limitations of Process-Based Life Cycle Assessments (PLCAs), including data collection challenges, dynamic environmental changes, and subjective methodological choices. Through the case study of Ecoinvent 3.7 the study underscores the need for improved transparency, standardisation, and reproducibility in Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) to provide more accurate and reliable environmental impact evaluations.

AB  - The renewed global efforts to contain climate change have meant a gateway for some Latin American countries to declare new military actions. The "war on deforestation," announced in 2021 by Ivan Duque, the former president of Colombia, is a paradigmatic example. Through Operation Artemis (Operacion Artemisa), the Colombian armed forces were assigned to protect the forests against threats from armed non-state actors (ANSAs) predominantly located in the country's Amazon rainforests. We argue that this war was a rhetorical and political model of the Duque government that sought, based on the re-elaboration of the counterinsurgent categories shared with the United States for half a century, to implement in the Amazon the first state military strategy to reach global agreements against climate change. Why does a state wage war in the name of protecting forests? We argue that in this novel rhetorical, military, and criminal framework, the war on deforestation encouraged the renewal of the war on drugs and the transformation of the internal enemy. Drawing on analyses of presidential policies passed since 1970 and, more recently, green crime law, this article showcases a new chapter on the state's goal of achieving territorial control through green militarization.

AB  - There is an increasing evidence for the significant value and potential of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (MAPs) worldwide. Among other non-wood forest products, MAPs are considered a key element of sustainable forest management and economic development. As part of Mediterranean cultural heritage, these plants are a major driver of rural tourism, in many areas representing an important raw material for various bio-based industrial sectors. Besides their economic value, MAPs enhance social integration and maintain gender balance as harvesting and processing MAPs is clearly a female dominated task. Despite the prominent contribution of MAPs to local development, conservation of biodiversity and the development of the traditional Mediterranean food system, many challenges and knowledge gaps could potentially place the sector's development at risk. The aim of this work is to examine the present situation of the MAPs sector in the most productive countries around the Mediterranean and to identify future challenges and priority actions to develop the MAPs sector in the region. To do so, a supply chain analysis was performed to identify the main stakeholders involved. Various experts from Croatia, France, Greece, Spain, and Tunisia participated in the SWOT analysis and the Delphi approach employed in this study. The results highlight the main challenges facing the sector in Mediterranean countries. Five groups of challenges are identified, related mainly to certification and labelling, life quality and wellbeing, market development, research development, and transforming and processing. To overcome these challenges, a set of actions is validated by the interviewed experts with the aim of improving marketing strategies and including various innovations related to political, legal, organisational, and institutional frameworks.

Social work educators are striving to adapt in the face of rapidity of knowledge expansion and of technological advancement, which impact the nature of pedagogy. Recent emphases on effectiveness and efficiency of technological innovations are overshadowing the questions of fit of technopedagogical systems with traditional social work values. There is evidence of a transformation of the understanding of the self as a virtual presence via electronic connection with other humans. Educators may equate their technological proficiency with teaching effectiveness and genuineness. Social work educators are encouraged to find ways to utilise technology to aid impartation of knowledge with active learners in ways that do not diminish personhood.

AB  - Agricultural intensification, including the conversion of agroecosystems into monocultures, is a leading cause of global biodiversity loss. Preserving smallholder farms that use traditional mixed cropping systems is one strategy to prevent further declines in arthropod biodiversity and maintaining crucial ecosystem services, such as those provided by natural enemies of pests. We investigated the impact of crop diversity on both the abundance and diversity of herbivores and their natural enemies within the traditional milpa intercropping system, with a particular focus on diversity in response to its widespread decline. We compared arthropod abundance, species richness and evenness as measured by the Shannon diversity index in replicated (n =15) plots (2 m x 2 m) of monocultures, bicultures and tricultures of maize, beans, and squash in an agricultural field in Oaxaca, Mexico. Our findings support the hypothesis that the milpa system fosters higher levels of arthropod diversity compared to monocultures, primarily due to independent effects of each crop species in an additive manner. Notably, our observations also revealed non-additive effects on herbivore diversity within the squash-maize bicultures, through the increase and decrease in abundances of less and more dominant insect groups, respectively. Overall, however, we did not detect an effect of crop diversity on aggregate arthropod abundance. Our results show that polycultures effectively increase biodiversity, but they also emphasize the need of considering plant interactions when selecting specific crop combinations.

AB  - The theorized benefits of mobile phone and Internet penetration have not been sufficiently tested, especially on cross-country data. Using a dataset involving 48 regionally grouped African countries and a robust dynamic system GMM model, this study attempts to fill this gap. In carrying out this study, we adopted an empirical strategy that allowed us to estimate the specific and complementary impacts of mobile phone, Internet, and rural electricity on food security, from panel and regional comparative perspectives. The findings indicate that: the incremental and intra-temporal effects in food security situation linger awhile; the promotional effects of ICT development on food security are more induced by mobile phone development than by Internet development; mobile phone and Internet have a robust and stable synergistic effect on food security; contrary to expectations, there is no complementarity between ICT protocols and rural electricity, with the impact of the latter on food security being more distortive than promotional; and that the promotional benefits of ICT protocols on food security are dependent on a country's capacity to resolve inherent deficiencies in rural electricity energy supply, climate conditions and credit challenges. Policy-wise, the findings confirm how the convergence and complementarity between mobile phone and Internet connectivity can conditionally be enhanced in the case of Africa; and how such convergence can potentially facilitate the catch-up between the lagging Internet access and the booming mobile phone subscription and to enhance the quality, quantity and relevance of the information contents of the ICT protocols.

AB  - Global warming impacts crop production and threatens food security. Elevated temperatures are sensed by different cell components. Temperature increases are classified as either mild warm temperatures or excessively hot temperatures, which are perceived by distinct signaling pathways in plants. Warm temperatures induce thermomorphogenesis, while high-temperature stress triggers heat acclimation and has destructive effects on plant growth and development. In this review, we systematically summarize the heat-responsive genetic networks in Arabidopsis and crop plants based on recent studies. In addition, we highlight the strategies used to improve grain yield under heat stress from a source-sink perspective. We also discuss the remaining issues regarding the characteristics of thermosensors and the urgency required to explore the basis of acclimation under multifactorial stress combination.

AB  - To maximize specific ecosystem services (ES) such as food production, people alter landscape structure, i.e., the types of ecosystems present, their relative proportions, and their spatial arrangement across landscapes. This can have significant, and sometimes unexpected, effects on biodiversity and ES. Communities need information about how land/use activities and changes to landscape structure are likely to affect biodiversity and ES, but current scientific understanding of these effects is incomplete. The Monteregie Connection (MC) project has used the rapidly suburbanizing agricultural Monteregien landscape just east of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to investigate how current and historic landscape structure influences ES provision. Our results highlight the importance of forest connectivity and functional diversity on ES provision, and show that ES provision can vary significantly even within single land-use types in response to changes in landscape structure. Our historical analysis reveals that levels of ES provision, as well as relationships among individual ES, can change dramatically through time. We are using these results to build quantitative ES-landscape structure models to assess four future landscape scenarios for the region: Periurban Development, Demand for Energy, Whole-System Crisis, and Green Development. These scenarios integrate empirical and historical data on ES provision with local stakeholder input about global and local social and ecological drivers to explore how land-use decisions could affect ES provision and human well-being across the region to the year 2045. By integrating empirical data, quantitative models, and scenarios we have achieved the central goals of the MC project: (1) increasing understanding of the effects of landscape structure on biodiversity and ES provision, (2) effectively linking this knowledge to decision making to better manage for biodiversity and ES, and (3) creating a vision for a more sustainable social-ecological system in the region.

AB  - Multi-level global governance was introduced at the United Nations summit in Rio in 1992 as a new model to achieve a broad global mobilization of different actors in sustainable development. This model has been extended to climate governance. It has become a global system with its own inherent logic, dynamics and stabilization mechanisms. This article deals with the systemic dimension (the architecture) of global multi-level climate governance across levels and sectors. It refers to the model and its practical implementation at different levels. The text poses four hypotheses: (1) the global multi-level system of climate governance can be regarded as a structure which offers opportunities for ambitious innovation-based climate strategies; (2) each level of the global system has its own specific responsibilities, challenges, opportunities and mechanisms for lesson-drawing; (3) the main lesson to be learned is to make use of the co-benefits characteristic to climate mitigation; and (4) the system's multi-sectoral and multi-actor structure provides additional opportunities to address such co-benefits and to mobilize different interests in the pursuit of climate policy objectives. After outlining these hypotheses in more detail, the article will then conclude with a set of policy recommendations. (c) 2017 The Authors.

AB  - The world economy has largely overcome the Malthusian challenge, but there are regions such as the Sahel where this challenge remains formidable and food insecurity is exacerbated by multiple threats of climate change, low agricultural productivity, and high population growth. While the interactions among these forces governing long-term food security are widely discussed for policy making in the Sahel, analysis of the comparative magnitude of the forces in the resulting food security outcomes is largely absent. In this paper, we identify the relative contribution of these long-term drivers of food security outcomes in rural and urban Niger into 2050. We then consider three policy scenarios to address food security issues: accelerated investments in agricultural R & D (supply side), reduction of fertility rates (demand side), and market integration. We use a historically validated partial equilibrium model tailored to Nigerien agriculture, with data inputs gleaned from various sources, including household and farm surveys and grid-cell level production data. Our study finds that among growth in population, income, and agricultural productivity and climate change impacts on yields and labor productivity, population growth in Niger will remain the single largest driver of crop output growth and undernourishment in the country. Three fourths of the increase in undernourished population is projected to be among the urban population. Climate change impacts on agricultural productivity will have differential impacts on undernourishment prevalence among rural and urban population, pushing an additional 2 million people into undernourishment by 2050. The relative impacts of climate change are larger among the rural population offsetting revenue gains from increased crop prices. We emphasize that feasible advancements in agricultural productivity are likely to be outpaced by rapid population growth and climate change setbacks unless simultaneous actions are taken on the demand side. On the supply side, interventions are required in transforming R & D spending into higher farm productivity. Greater integration into regional markets will also aide in mitigating undernourishment prevalence.

AB  - Global warming and greenhouse gas emissions have become a severe threat to our ecosystem. Prior studies on environment posit that ample exhaustion of fossil fuels for energy is one of the fundamental causes of environmental degradation and naturally replenished energy sources are affordable over fossil fuels. This study set out to examine the role of financial sectors and globalization (in the presence of energy and renewable energy consumption) for a sustainable environment in the panel of Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries in One Belt and One Road initiative perspective. The current study uses annual data of 16 CEE countries covering the period of 1980 to 2016. After confirmation of cross-sectional dependency and co-integration among variables, we applied the Dynamic Seemingly Unrelated Regression and Dumitrescu-Hurlin causality approach for long-run estimations and to check the causal relationship, respectively. The empirical findings of the study certify the existence of an environmental Kuznets curve for the selected panel countries. Globalization is enhancing the environmental quality of the CEE economies. It is important to note that energy consumption and renewable energy consumption have a positive and statistically significant whack on carbon emission. In addition, we do not find a significant link between financial development and carbon emission. Granger casualty test confirms a two-way causal relationship between economic growth and carbon emission, globalization and environmental degradation, globalization and renewable energy consumption, economic growth and renewable energy consumption, and between financial development and energy consumption. Moreover, we found one-way causality from energy consumption (renewable and non-renewable) to carbon emissions. Based on the findings, a number of appropriate policy suggestions are presented in the perspective of Central and Eastern European Countries.

AB  - Pollination services to increase crop production are becoming more and more important, as we are facing both climate change and a growing world population. Both are predicted to impact food security worldwide. High-density, commercial beekeeping has become a key link in the food supply chain, and diseases have become a central issue in hive losses around the world. American Foulbrood (AFB) disease is a highly contagious bacterial brood disease in honey bees (Apis mellifera), leading to hive losses worldwide. The causative agent is the Gram+ bacterium Paenibacillus larvae, which is able to infect honey bee larvae during the first 3 days of their lives. It can be found in hives around the world with viable spores for decades. Antibiotics are largely ineffective in treating the disease as they are only efficient against the vegetative state. Once a hive shows the clinical manifestation of the disease, the only effective way to eradicate it and prevent the spread of the disease is by burning the hive, the equipment, and the colony. Because of its virulent nature and detrimental effects on honey bee colonies, AFB is classified as a notifiable disease worldwide. Effective, safe, and sustainable methods are needed to ensure the wellbeing of honey bee colonies. Even though insects lack antibodies, which are the main requisites for trans-generational immune priming (TGIP), they can prime their offspring against persisting pathogens. Here, we demonstrate an increased survival of infected honey bee larvae after their queen was vaccinated, compared to offspring of control queens (placebo vaccinated). These results indicate that TGIP in insects can be used to majorly enhance colony health, protect commercial pollinators from deadly diseases, and reduce high financial and material losses to beekeepers.

AB  - The question of how best to tackle anthropogenic climate change is a thorny one: besides scientific uncertainty regarding the consequences of climate change, another difficulty is that the recommendations of climate experts may clash with the priorities of citizens, interest groups and political institutions. With the European Green Deal, the European Union (EU) recently made significant advances in climate policy; at the same time, and as is well known, the EU and its institutions have long been criticised for their "democratic deficit " and for their failure to involve all civil society actors equally in EU law-making processes. This article sheds light on the legal framework governing civil society participation in EU law-making, and more specifically on the Commission's consultations pursuant to Article 11(3) of the Treaty on European Union. It then critically assesses selected features of two consultations conducted by the Commission in connection with the European Climate Law, which it evaluates from the perspective of the EU primary law principles of democracy, openness and transparency. Through this analysis, and by suggesting how future climate consultations could be further improved, the article aims to contribute to the (still nascent) legal scholarship on civil society participation in environmental and climate policy.

AB  - 1. Basal levels of metabolism vary significantly among individuals in many taxa, but the effects of this on fitness are generally unknown. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) in juvenile salmon and trout is positively related to dominance status and ability to obtain a feeding territory, but it is not clear how this translates into performance in natural conditions. 2. The relationships between RMR, dominance, territoriality and growth rates of yearling Atlantic salmon Salmo salar were examined in relation to predictability in food supply and habitat complexity, using replicate sections of a large-scale controlled semi-natural stream. 3. Estimated RMR was a strong predictor of dominance, and under conditions of a predictable food supply in a structurally simple habitat, high estimated RMR fish obtained the best feeding territories and grew faster. 4. When the spatial distribution of food was made less predictable, dominant (high estimated RMR) fish were still able to occupy the most profitable feeding locations by periodically moving location to track the changes in food availability, but RMR was no longer a predictor of growth rate. Moreover, when a less predictable food supply was combined with a visually more complex (and realistic) habitat, fish were unable to track changes in food availability, grew more slowly and exhibited greater site fidelity, and there were no relationships between estimated RMR and quality of occupied territory or growth rate. 5. The relative benefit of RMR is thus context dependent, depending on both habitat complexity and the predictability of the food supply. Higher habitat complexity and lower food predictability decrease the performance advantages associated with a high RMR.

AB  - Negative emissions are increasingly seen as a policy option to limit climate change. However, the most readily available technologies that could deliver negative emissions require, if deployed at scale, large amounts of land, with huge risks for livelihoods and the environment. This land is often assumed to be in the Global South. This article analyzes the nascent policy discourse on negative emissions by assessing 116 policy documents by 97 organizations with a focus on land-based technologies (afforestation and reforestation, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, biochar, soil carbon sequestration). We conclude that this policy discourse is largely centered in the Global North (mostly in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany), with only five organizations directly linked to the Global South. 61% of the organizations in our sample, however, somehow refer to the Global South in their contributions, with nongovernmental organizations being most strongly focused on the role of the Global South and in particular the risks for vulnerable countries. While the earlier policy discourse on negative emissions was linked to a more general "geoengineering" discourse, this link has loosened in the last years. Overall, in the documents that we studied, negative emissions technologies seem to become more accepted, and parts of the discourse shift towards deployment. Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage seems more often associated with risks if compared to other land-based negative emissions technologies, especially with a view to the Global South.

AB  - This article examines scholarly debates that cast Soviet policies for the emancipation of women in Central Asia as instances of colonial domination, as the modernizing endeavours of a revolutionary state or as combinations of both and takes them to task for overlooking the gendered consequences of the 'Soviet paradox'. This paradox is evident in the combined and contradictory operations of a socialist paternalism that supported and legitimized women's presence in the public sphere (through education, work and political representation), with a command economy and nationalities policy that effectively stalled processes of social transformation commonly associated with modernity. Post-Soviet gender ideologies do not represent a simple return to national traditions, interrupted by Soviet policies, but constitute a strategic redeployment of notions of cultural authenticity in the service of new ideological goals. The politics of gender, thus, plays a crucial role in signalling both a break from the Soviet past and in creating new imaginaries of the nation that enhance social solidarity in increasingly fractured post-Soviet societies. The official endorsement of Islam, as a central tenet of national identity and the simultaneous rejection and policing of its more radical expressions contributes further to the politicization of gender, while the promotion of gender equality by the international donor community carries limited credibility in a context where the core of women's former claims to citizenship-through welfare entitlements and social protection by the state-has been thoroughly eroded.

One option for the usage of biomass from these areas is bioenergy production, if both the herbaceous biomass yield and the chemical characteristics of the cut meet the needs. In 2007 the largest average annual biomass yield per area was achieved in floodplain meadows (5.7 t dry mass/ha), which also have the highest potential for biomass production among Estonian semi-natural grasslands (more than 113,000 t dry mass). The area of mesic meadows is larger, but due to lower average yield per area (2.5 t dry mass/ha), the potential of this meadow type was less than half of that of floodplain meadows (53,000 t dry mass). The corresponding numbers for wooded meadows were 1.6 t dry mass/ha and 12,000 t dry mass, respectively. Chemical characteristics of herbaceous biomass from wooded meadows significantly differed from mesic and floodplain meadows, giving the highest values of Ca, K, Mg, crude protein and ash (1.3%, 2.4%, 0.3%, 10.9% and 9.5% of the dry biomass, respectively). The energetic value of the biomass from different meadow types varied between 18.1 kJ/g and 18.6 kJ/g. Therefore, various options for bioenergy conversion should be considered depending on the local plant community and restrictions to the harvest time. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective. Our objective is to explain how scientists interpret less-than-certain scientific findings to inform policymakers' choices on controversial science policy issues. We focus on two particularly difficult policy cases concerning global climate change and low-dose radiation protection. Methods. Our method is to analyze data from a unique multination survey of scientists to analyze the ways their views about what is scientifically correct are translated into judgments about appropriate policy. The surveys asked scientists, randomly drawn from U. S. and E. U. subscribers to the journal Science, to indicate the "most likely'' relationships between greenhouse gas emissions and average global temperatures and between radiation dose and incidence of cancer in humans. Follow-up questions asked for their judgments about appropriate policy targets for reductions in greenhouse gas emission and safety standards for radiation exposure. The data permit analysis of the relationships between scientific certainty and policy judgments in these two cases. Results. Our results shed light on when and how scientists reach precautionary policy conclusions, demonstrating that scientists' application of precaution is dependent on context. In the case of radiation protection, greater certainty is associated with less precaution. But with respect climate change, we found the opposite relationship. Conclusions. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for the role of scientists, and scientific advice, in the policy process.

AB  - Biochar is obtained from the thermochemical conversion of biomass in an oxygen-limited environment. Beyond its use for soil amendment and carbon sequestration, other value-added applications, such as a green environmental sorbent for different types of pollutants, are also of increasing interest. This paper reviews the available literature on the use of various feedstocks for biochar production as an initial step to compile the required inventory data from material flow data analysis. The environmental evaluation of different schemes of biochar production in a life cycle perspective reports the environmental impacts of the different alternatives, with more sustainable profiles than the use of activated carbon as conventional adsorption material. Moreover, most systems were validated as negative carbon processes with favorable performance regarding climate change mitigation. In particular, materials based on lignocellulosic waste were responsible for the highest environmental benefits, mainly due to their largest energy potential in comparison with other feedstocks.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the relationship among municipal waste generation, greenhouse gas emissions, and GDP in Switzerland over the period 1990-2017. We apply both time series procedures (stationarity and causality tests) and a Machine Learning approach. Empirical findings underline a bidirectional causal relationship between municipal solid waste generation and GDP, indicating that the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis holds for Switzerland. Moreover, we found that waste recovery (recycling and composting) is a key driver in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, in the Tree Model, the probability that a change in the waste recovery variable could lead to a reduction in the greenhouse gas emissions registered a value of 87%. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - It is often argued that biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are linked by both habitat and species composition, and that this relationship is particularly critical for mobile ecosystem service providers. This may be especially true for pollinators, which are essential for the reproduction of the majority of flowering plant species, are highly mobile, and can exhibit dramatically different foraging behaviors across ecosystems. Understanding how habitat and community composition impact pollination is especially relevant in urban environments where pollinators can promote food security. We examined the relationships between local resource density, landscape composition, pollinator abundance and richness, and pollination services in an urban agricultural system spanning >125 km of the California central coast. We used a replicated, experimental approach to evaluate the reproductive success of jalapeno peppers across urban gardens and conducted a greenhouse experiment to evaluate the benefits of insect-mediated pollination to pepper reproduction. In the greenhouse, we found that jalapeno fruit weight and seed number was significantly greater with insect-mediated pollination than without. In the field, we found that jalapeno seed number increased significantly with herbaceous (weed, crop, and ornamental) plant richness and the number of perennial trees and shrubs at the site level, but decreased with the amount of natural landscape cover. We also found that higher pollinator richness enhanced seed number in floral-dense gardens, likely due to the greater functional complementarity of a more diverse pollinator community. Furthermore, there was a positive relationship between pollinator abundance and seed number, but it weakened in gardens with more flowers, likely through lower per-plant pollinator visitation in the presence of competing floral resources. As in past studies, we found that mulch had a negative impact on pollinator abundance, highlighting that abiotic factors commonly managed by gardeners can directly impact ecosystem service providers. This study demonstrates that local conditions can significantly influence ecosystem service provision and that urban gardeners need to optimize for both pollinator richness and floral resource availability to achieve optimal pollination.

The results are as follows: (1) the SDM supports a nonlinear contribution of dual environmental-regulations spillover to GTFP. The relationship between formal environmental-regulation and GTFP is an inverted U-shape, while a U-shaped nonlinear relationship is found between informal environmental regulation and GTFP. (2) Green technology innovation has a significant negative moderating effect on the process of dual environmental-regulations affecting GTFP in local regions, but a positive moderating effect on informal environmental regulation in neighboring regions. (3) There is a significant green technology innovation threshold effect of dual environmental-regulations affecting GTFP. Specifically, the promotion effect of dual environmental-regulations on GFFP gradually increases as the level of green technology innovation increases.

AB  - Afforestation is an important mitigation strategy for climate change due to its carbon sequestration potential. Besides this favorable biogeochemical effect on global CO2 concentrations, afforestation also affects the regional climate by changing the biogeophysical land surface characteristics. In this study, we investigate the effects of an idealized global CO2 reduction to pre-industrial conditions by a Europe-wide afforestation experiment on the regional longwave radiation balance, starting in the year 1986 on a continent entirely covered with grassland. Results show that the impact of biogeophysical processes on the surface temperatures is much stronger than that of biogeochemical processes. Furthermore, biogeophysically induced changes of the surface temperatures, atmospheric temperatures, and moisture concentrations are as important for the regional longwave radiation balance as the global CO2 reduction. While the outgoing longwave radiation is increased in winter, it is reduced in summer. In terms of annual total, a Europe-wide afforestation has a regional warming effect despite reduced CO2 concentrations. Thus, even for an idealized reduction of the global CO2 concentrations to pre-industrial levels, the European climate response to afforestation would still be dominated by its biogeophysical effects.

AB  - Environmental sustainability can positively affect quality of life by reducing environmental degradation and increasing access to natural resources, while economic sustainability initiatives can have both positive and negative impacts on quality of life, depending on the context. Social sustainability initiatives can also have both positive and negative impacts on quality of life, particularly for marginalized communities and low-income populations. The investigation draws on a comprehensive national survey in Spain encompassing 2,270 responses, ensuring representative profiles in terms of gender, residence, income, age, and economic sector. Considering the aforementioned factors, this research aims to underscore the necessity of recognizing the interconnections between sustainability and quality of life in policy and decision-making processes towards social happiness. To achieve this, an analysis of variance is presented, enabling the examination of significant differences in the sociodemographic characteristics of Spanish citizens across the three dimensions defining sustainability. Specifically, income, age and population size are key in determining the relationship between sustainability and social happiness. Furthermore, an econometric analysis has demonstrated a positive relationship between sustainability and quality of life in Spain. The key factors are safety, trust, income, and accessibility. The findings of this study can provide valuable insights to inform policy decisions aimed at promoting sustainability and enhancing the overall quality of life. The interlinked integration of smart cities and smart rural areas constitutes the quality of life zone that influences sustainability.

AB  - This review focuses on the role of carbohydrate binding in the toxicity of the most utilized group of Bt pesticidal proteins-three domain Cry (3D-Cry) toxins. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) proteins are an environmentally safe and effective alternative to chemical pesticides and have been used as biopesticides, with great commercial success, for over 50 years. Global agricultural production is predicted to require a 70% increase until 2050 to provide for an increasing population. In addition to agriculture, Bt proteins are utilized to control human vectors of disease-namely mosquitoes-which account for >700 000 deaths annually. The evolution of resistance to Bt pesticial toxins threatens the progression of sustainable agriculture. Whilst Bt protein toxins are heavily utilized, the exact mechanisms behind receptor binding and toxicity are unknown. It is critical to gain a better understanding of these mechanisms in order to engineer novel toxin variants and to predict, and prevent, future resistance evolution. This review focuses on the role of carbohydrate binding in the toxicity of the most utilized group of Bt pesticidal proteins-three domain Cry (3D-Cry) toxins.

The existing literature often falls short in providing an exhaustive interpretation of such a role of GP in the critical industry sectors. This study employs a two-stage approach, comprising database construction, filtering, coding, and statistical analysis, aimed at conducting a systematic bibliometric review of the studies related to GP to identify its functionalities, including promoting sustainable development, initiating new industry policies, and stimulating innovation. The most addressed industry sectors by researchers are manufacturing, food, agriculture, and construction. Environmental science is the most explored research field, and the circular economy appears as the most recent bursting keyword. The insights from this review identify research gaps and challenges, based on which the proposing directions for future research are suggested, including promoting a circular economy, the sustainable development of the healthcare sector, protecting sustainable supply chains, efficiency evaluation, the application of artificial intelligence technologies in procurement, and exploring inter-functional relationships in GP.

AB  - Insulin is an essential hormone for animal activity and survival, and it controls the metabolic functions of the entire body. Throughout the evolution of metazoan animals and the development of their brains, a sustainable energy supply has been essential to overcoming the competition for survival under various environmental stresses. Managing energy for metabolism, preservation, and consumption inevitably involves high oxidative stress, causing tissue damage in various organs. In both mice and humans, excessive dietary intake can lead to insulin resistance in various organs, ultimately displaying metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Insulin signals require thorough regulation to maintain metabolism across diverse environments. Recent studies demonstrated that two types of forkhead-box family transcription factors, FOXOs and FOXKs, are related to the switching of insulin signals during fasting and feeding states. Insulin signaling plays a role in supporting higher activity during periods of sufficient food supply and in promoting survival during times of insufficient food supply. The insulin receptor depends on the tyrosine phosphatase feedback of insulin signaling to maintain adipocyte insulin responsiveness. alpha 4, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), has been shown to play a crucial role in modulating insulin signaling pathways by regulating the phosphorylation status of key proteins involved in these pathways. This short review summarizes the current understanding of the molecular mechanism related to the regulation of insulin signals.

The experiments were conducted in three replicates with six treatments (four Pseudomonas strains, AMF and control) and three rates of P-fertilizer (0, 75, 150 kg P ha(-1)). Application of higher phosphate rates decreased total antioxidant capacity, total phenolic and flavonols content, whereas AMF and Pseudomonas strains increased quality and P concentration of fruit. The use of AMF and Pseudomonas strains resulted in better quality when used along with 75 kg P ha(-1). These results demonstrated that the rhizospheric microorganisms improved the quality of fruit, especially when they applied in combination with lower rates of chemical fertilizers. Therefore, application of these microorganisms in sustainable agriculture is recommended.

AB  - The invasion of jumping worms, a small group of pheretimoid earthworm species from Asia, has increasingly become an ecological, environmental and conservation issue in forest ecosystems and urban-suburban landscapes around the world. Their presence is often noticed due to their high abundance, distinctive "jumping" behavior, and prominent granular casts on the soil surface. Although they are known to affect soil carbon dynamics and nutrient availability, no single paper has summarized their profound impacts on soil biodiversity, plant community, and animals of all trophic groups that rely on soil and the leaf litter layer for habitat, food, and shelter. In this study, we summarize the biology, invasion, and ecological impacts of invasive jumping worms across North America. We highlight potential impacts of this second wave of earthworm invasion, contrast them with the preceding European earthworm invasion in temperate forests in North America, and identify annual life cycle, reproductive and cocoon survival strategies, casting behavior and co-invasion dynamics as the key factors that contribute to their successful invasion and distinct ecological impacts. We then suggest potential management and control strategies for practitioners and policy makers, underscore the importance of coordinated community science projects in tracking the spread, and identify knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to understand and control the invasion.

AB  - Consumer debt has risen dramatically in the United States since the early 1980s. Household debt-to-disposable income rose from around 65% in 1980 to 135% in 2022. As we have shown previously, rising debt levels mean that the problem of income inequality is worse than currently thought, and the living standards of Americans are lower than measured. In The Affluent Society, John Kenneth Galbraith builds on Thorstein Veblen's work, The Theory of the Leisure Class, arguing that emulation and persuasion lead not only to more debt but also to an eventual crash and, thus, to greater economic volatility. Excessive debt also makes it harder for people to save for retirement, emergencies, and their children's education, and it exerts a drag on consumer spending overall and economic growth since money used to repay past debt (and the interest on that debt) cannot be used to purchase new goods and services. The article concludes with some institutionalist policy solutions to improve the issuance, repayment, and discharging of household debt in ways that will dampen the destabilization of household finances and the macroeconomy.

AB  - Food security remains a major concern, as efforts to commercialise and specialise in agricultural production have been constrained. This is partly due to land scarcity, compelling smallholder farmers to operate on fragmented lands. Land reforms that seek to consolidate lands and promote crop specialisation can be welfare-enhancing because they can stimulate investment in agricultural innovation. Rwanda's 2008 land use consolidation (LUC) programme merges parcels of land and promotes crop specialisation. After more than a decade of its implementation, the beckoning question is whether LUC programme has improved technology adoption. Relying on previous three rounds of national survey data, capturing before and after the implementation of LUC pro-gramme, this paper contributes to the literature by (1) assessing the short-and long-run relationships between LUC and improved input uptake and (2) determining what conditions could influence the way LUC impact technology adoption. The result shows that the implementation of LUC leads to uptake of agricultural inputs both in the short-and long-run, but the impact is more in the long run. While in the short run, access to finance and asset ownership act as the underlying conditioning factors, in the long run, the dominant complementary factor is access to credit. These results suggest that there might be underlying structural factors that may inhibit the influence of LUC on technology adoption and hence the attainment of the goal of food security in Rwanda.

AB  - How do financial professionals work with technological visions of the future of banking? Such visions are prompted by the technology sub-sector known as FinTech, a broad phenomenon of start-ups and technological innovations aimed at financial services markets, characterised by claims that banking could be radically different. Drawing on pragmatic studies of finance and Cornelius Castoriadis's theory of creative imagination, this paper explores the imaginative limits of technology innovation in established banks. Through analysis of semi-structured interviews with banking and FinTech professionals, observations at industry events, and analysis of documents obtained from banks, the findings highlight an interplay between dominant vernaculars of 'strategic value' and organisational imaginaries of traditional banking. This interplay delimits the boundaries of technological imagination through reshaping the moral and temporal claims of FinTech disruption discourse. This entails a move from the moral modality of what should be, found in FinTech disruption narratives, to a modality of what can be; a shift from the dramatic narratives of changing powerful structures, drawing on the discursive repertoires of social movements and religious myths, to the non-heroic, pragmatic expectations of the art of the possible.

The empirical findings suggest that privatization has a positive contemporaneous impact on economic growth, but the effects on labor productivity, income distribution, and unemployment appear two years after the privatization reforms. More concretely, privatization reforms may be implemented with increases in productivity and decreases in unemployment, but to the detriment of income equality.

AB  - Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are an important tool for the maintenance of marine ecosystem functionality and health and ensuring the onward flow of beneficial ecosystem services that support human well-being. Social and economic factors influence whether and how stakeholders exploit resources or cooperate to conserve them. Environmental managers are now turning from designating MPAs to monitoring their effectiveness. Combining spatial analysis with quantitative and qualitative survey methods this research shows that an MPA (Lyme Bay, SW England) has had varying effects on the delivery of the beneficial ecosystem service of leisure and recreation. In the survey years 2008-2011 dive businesses have increased their frequency of activity inside and outside the MPA and report an increase in turnover; though they perceive little or no effect of the MPA on business. Charter boat operators have seen an overall decline in the frequency of activity outside the MPA and an increase inside the MPA. They perceive that the MPA has increasingly had a positive effect on their business. Sea angling activity has declined at sites outside the MPA and increased at sites within the MPA, suggesting a redistribution of spatial activity. Diving activity has increased both inside and outside the MPA. Divers report that the MPA has influenced where they choose to dive. This corresponds to a potential increase in value of the MPA resource (represented as the proportional expenditure and associated turnover by these groups) of 2.2 million. This research demonstrates that the use of the resource has changed following designation and that MPAs can attract a greater proportion of the leisure and recreation expenditure and associated turnover to sites within the MPA boundary. Moving forward it is important to assess effects both inside and outside MPAs. Integrating high quality social science at MPA sites to track effectiveness can help to adapt and refine management strategies to reflect the needs of the stakeholders and support effective conservation.

AB  - Soil is a huge terrestrial carbon pool, which has higher carbon storage than the sum of atmospheric and terrestrial vegetation carbon. Small fluctuations in soil carbon pool can affect regional carbon flux and global climate change. As soil organic carbon plays key roles in soil carbon storage and sequestration, studying its composition, sources and stability mechanism is a key to deeply understand the functions of terrestrial ecosystem and how it will respond to climate changes. The recently-proposed concept of soil Microbial Carbon Pump (MCP) emphasizes the importance of soil microbial anabolism and its contributions to soil carbon formation and stabilization, which can be applied for elucidating the source, formation and sequestration of soil organic carbon. This article elaborates MCP-mediated soil carbon sequestration mechanism and its influencing factors, as well as representative scientific questions we may explore with the soil MCP conceptual framework.

AB  - Patterns of environmental spatial structure lie at the heart of the most fundamental and familiar patterns of diversity on Earth. Antarctica contains some of the strongest environmental gradients on the planet and therefore provides an ideal study ground to test hypotheses on the relevance of environmental variability for biodiversity. To answer the pivotal question, "How does spatial variation in physical and biological environmental properties across the Antarctic drive biodiversity?" we have synthesized current knowledge on environmental variability across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine Antarctic biomes and related this to the observed biotic patterns. The most important physical driver of Antarctic terrestrial communities is the availability of liquid water, itself driven by solar irradiance intensity. Patterns of biota distribution are further strongly influenced by the historical development of any given location or region, and by geographical barriers. In freshwater ecosystems, free water is also crucial, with further important influences from salinity, nutrient availability, oxygenation, and characteristics of ice cover and extent. In the marine biome there does not appear to be one major driving force, with the exception of the oceanographic boundary of the Polar Front. At smaller spatial scales, ice cover, ice scour, and salinity gradients are clearly important determinants of diversity at habitat and community level. Stochastic and extreme events remain an important driving force in all environments, particularly in the context of local extinction and colonization or recolonization, as well as that of temporal environmental variability. Our synthesis demonstrates that the Antarctic continent and surrounding oceans provide an ideal study ground to develop new biogeographical models, including life history and physiological traits, and to address questions regarding biological responses to environmental variability and change.

AB  - Listeriosis is a serious zoonotic disease caused by the genus Listeria, with Listeria monocytogenes being the most pathogenic species for humans and various animal species. This bacterium is commonly found in the environment and poses significant health risks. We analysed official surveillance data detailing animal listeriosis in Germany over the last decade to unravel its host diversity and spatiotemporal distribution. Altogether, 1.629 notifications involving 3.326 various animal species were reported. Listeriosis has a broad host range in farm animals and wildlife, with a consistently striking incidence reported nationwide. Addressing this issue is crucial for public health and the safety of our food supply.

AB  - Many species up- or downregulate their resting metabolic rate (RMR) when they encounter favourable or unfavourable feeding conditions, respectively. This is thought to promote faster growth when food is abundant and conserve energy reserves when food is scarce. The time it takes to express metabolic plasticity remain little studied. Here, we develop a conceptual model showing how rapid or slow metabolic plasticity alter growth trajectories in response to changes in food supply. We test predictions from the model in a food manipulation experiment with young-of-the-year northern pike, Esox lucius, a species that experience drastic changes in food supply in nature. We find that metabolic plasticity is expressed gradually over several weeks in this species. Rapid changes in food supply thus caused apparent trait-environment mismatches that persisted for at least five weeks. Contrary to predictions, pike grew faster at high food levels when they had previously experienced low food levels and downregulated their RMR. This was not owing to increases in food intake but probably reflected that low RMRs increased the energetic scope for growth when feeding conditions improved. This highlights the important but complex effects of metabolic plasticity on growth dynamics under variable resource levels on ecologically relevant time scales.

AB  - To offset the negative impact of photovoltaic modules on the environment, it is necessary to introduce a long-term strategy that includes a complete lifecycle assessment of all system components from the production phase through installation and operation to disposal. Recycling of waste products and worn-out systems is an important element of this strategy. As the conclusions from the previous studies have shown, thermal treatment provides an efficient first step in the recycling process, while chemical treatment was more advantageous in the second step. This study aims to assess the environmental impact of recovering and recycling the valuable semiconductor silicon wafer material from photovoltaic solar cells. A comparison was made between producing new solar cells with or without recycled silicon material. The analysis of the photovoltaic cell life cycle scenario including material recycling presented in this article was performed using SimaPro software and data combined and extended from different LCI databases. The idea is that the use of recycled materials, which were energy-consuming in the primary production stage, allows to meaningly reduce the energy input in the secondary life cycle. All stages of the silicon cell life cycle contribute to the Global Warming Potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas emissions reductions through the use of recycled silicon material represented 42%. The total environmental impact of photovoltaic production can be reduced by as much as 58%, mainly through reduced energy consumption in the production process of high purity crystalline silicon.

AB  - Background Homecare, a cornerstone of public health, is essential for health systems to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of universal health coverage while maintaining its own sustainability. Notwithstanding homecare's system-level significance, there is a lack of economic evaluations of homecare services in terms of their system-wide cost-savings. Specifically, decisions informed by a joint medical-social budgetary perspective can maximize the allocative efficiency of assigning a diverse service mix to address the complex needs of the older adult population. However, little is known regarding which homecare service mix is most system-wide cost-effective when paired with which clinical profiles.Methods Valuation of homecare's complex interventions was performed under a generalized cost-effectiveness analysis (GCEA) framework with proportional hazard-adjusted metrics representing the common numeraire between medical and social care.Results Instrumental homecare, on its own or combined with either one or both of the other homecare services, yielded the greatest cost savings compared to other services or the lack thereof. When expressed under a joint medical-social budgetary perspective, instrumental homecare can reduce medical costs of HK$34.53 (US$4.40) and HK$85.03 (US$10.84) for every HK$1 (US$0.13) invested in instrumental and instrumental-restorative homecare, respectively.Conclusion Instrumental homecare can increase hospitalization-free days among community-dwelling older adult and yield significant net system-wide cost savings. Thus, the current study demonstrated the feasibility of data-informed decision-making in system-wide resource allocation under a joint medical-social budget perspective.

AB  - Although the resource curse has achieved much attention in the past few years, very little research has fully demonstrated the influence of resource dependence on environmental sustainability concerning the way to break the resource curse. Meanwhile, policymakers spare no efforts to formulate corresponding policies toward the goals of environmental sustainability. Considering the differences in the level of economic development and resource endowments of different countries, it is necessary to explain the cause of the resource curse in developing countries through resource-oriented development. In this regard, this study estimated the role of resource dependence on carbon dioxide emissions (CO2 emissions) in the background of 250 Chinese peripheral cities from 2000 to 2018. The results confirm that resource dependence has significantly accelerated CO2 emissions and the condition of the resource curse may still exist in the view of CO2 emissions at the prefecture level. We further find the technological innovation factors, including the introduction of high-speed rail (HSR) and science and technology investment all exist negative moderating effects of resource dependence on CO2 emissions. Such findings imply that the resource curse measured by CO2 emissions is not inevitable when effective policy suggestions are proposed.

AB  - The Italian NRRP provides considerable financial resources to promote a green transition and a digital transformation of people and territories. Young people living in the inner areas of Italy have an opportunity to overcome marginality and become key actors of development, making of diversity an asset rather than a source of inequality and epistemic injustice. Based on these premises, the research illustrates the youth policies and the strategies for inner areas within the framework of the Italian NRRP, then focuses on the peculiarities of young people living in inner areas. The analysis highlights the need to create new jobs in peripheral territories, to make migration an opportunity rather than a necessity. Specifically, it is important to approach the issue of employment in inner areas with the lens of youth policies, that is, by developing bottom-up approaches to discover latent and untapped potential to be used to achieve sustainability.

AB  - This paper explores the diverse impact of the Olympic Movement on society, emphasizing core values like 'excellence', 'friendship', and 'respect'. Traditionally, the Olympic Movement actively promotes global sport through initiatives such as Olympic education programs, instilling moral dimensions, cultural values, and essential life skills. Recent Olympic Games are scrutinized for their organizers' focus on safety, pandemic management, environmental sustainability, and gender equality. This paper addresses crucial policy options, spanning human rights, social inclusion through sport, and the pervasive issue of inactivity affecting public health. Noteworthy successes in leveraging sports for refugees and combating substance use disorders are discussed, alongside joint efforts by the World Health Organization and the International Olympic Committee, to combat inactivity and promote health through sports. Exploration of gender equality in the Olympic Movement recognizes challenges and suggests actions, including increasing female participation and addressing sexual harassment. The intersection of sports, climate change, and environmental responsibility is examined, with a focus on the ambitious 'climate-positive' goals of the Paris 2024 Olympics. However, since most of the IOC actions are rather symbolic and not substantial, many organizations are called upon to take active initiatives. Actionable recommendations urge countries to prioritize physical activity policies, organize exercise programs, and collaborate across sectors for health and environmental sustainability. The Olympic Games should focus on promoting mass sports participation, fostering positive attitudes, enhancing public health through sports, education, peace, and societal values, advocating for a holistic approach that champions ethical values, and promoting Olympic education to build a better world through sports.

AB  - In this paper, the Advanced Optical Photovoltaic Thermal System (ADOPTS) solar collector was thoroughly tested and analyzed in performance and cost analysis. The ADOPTS collector integrates optics within the PV/T device to enable geometric concentration, as well as a protection of the solar cells from the elements using the same encapsulation. The rooftop or facade mounted photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) collector provides a low cost, two-in-one solution for residential/commercial hot water and electricity needs, while also providing a renewable energy option to reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions. The ADOPTS collector can provide 150 W-el/m(2) and 400 W-th/m(2), and prevent a total of 3916 kg of CO2/m(2) (or 4.3 tons CO2/m(2)) over a 20-year period. The collector provides a low cost option that delivers both heat and electricity for single or multifamily homes and commercial buildings to compete with current commercialized PV and thermal systems, while simultaneously preventing CO2 emissions and reducing the need for natural gas.

AB  - The proposed system is designed to address the growing demand for sustainable and efficient energy solutions that can minimize greenhouse gas emissions while meeting the increasing energy needs of a modern world. The integrated approach of the system allows it to produce not only electricity but also hydrogen and fresh water from seawater, making it a comprehensive solution to multiple challenges. The system comprises several components that work together including a gas turbine unit, Rankine and organic Rankine cycles, a multi -effect desalination (MED) system, and a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer. One significant characteristic of this system is its ability to generate hydrogen, which is later combined with the inlet fuel of the gas turbine. This novel methodology presents a more environmentally friendly fuel alternative, showcasing its potential to enhance combustion efficiency in a sustainable manner. To ensure the viability and feasibility of the system, a MATLAB function was utilized for calculating the base case scenario, followed by a GA optimization technique with the aid of a machine learning model to minimize run-time. In the given scenario, the total cost rate is measured at 3726 $/h, with an exergy efficiency of 54% and a normalized CO2 emission of 305 kg/GJ. Following the optimization process, significant enhancements can be observed. The cost rate decreases by 2202 $/h, the exergy efficiency improves from 54% to 55.61%, and the annual CO2 emissions decrease from 133,760 metric tons to 50,320 metric tons. Moreover, the implementation of blended fuel leads to a 10% decrease in normalized CO2 emissions.

AB  - Many plastic wastes, particularly contaminated plastic packaging or fabrics, cannot be easily recycled. Among chemical recycling methods, pyrolysis combines low greenhouse gas emissions with low infrastructure requirements. A shaker reactor was adapted to model rotary kilns for cold start pyrolysis, where the waste is progressively heated, and fluidized beds/stirred reactors for hot start pyrolysis, where the waste is introduced into a hot reactor and kept at a constant temperature. For cold start pyrolysis, no feedstock preprocessing is necessary, and liquid yields of up to 80% by weight (wt %) were achieved, with no observable effect from different vapor residence times. Hot start pyrolysis gave similar yields but is more complex to implement. Thus, cold start pyrolysis is preferred. The hydrocarbon products from both conditions were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Cold start product distributions clustered according to polyethylene and polypropylene-based materials but were unaffected by vapor residence times. The reaction start type did not significantly affect the median molecular carbon count, with the hot start yielding more aromatics. The heat requirements for cold start pyrolysis were 1.0 kJ/g for polyethylene-based feedstocks and 0.8 kJ/g for polypropylene-based feedstocks. This heat may be provided by renewable sources or by combusting less than one-third of the pyrolysis gases.

Many of these applications directly involve classifying or clustering time series and have leveraged recent methodological advances within the frequency (spectral) domain. This paper reviews methods for clustering/classifying time series in the frequency domain and, in particular, describes various methods for different types of time series ranging from linear and stationary to nonlinear and nonstationary. Our perspective is cast from the statistics/data science literature and does not migrate into the literature on signal processing. Finally, we also summarize various aspects related to implementation, thereby providing the necessary context for interested practitioners.

AB  - Climate change, natural disasters, and harmful human activities adversely affect land fertility, leading to food scarcity and biodiversity loss. However, sustainable biodiversity management in the agricultural sector can be the only solution that requires huge funding. Biodiversity finance can be a way to strengthen the agriculture sector and attain sustainable development goals (SDGs). It is a relatively new concept and is still in its developing stage. It requires an in-depth bibliometric analysis highlighting the past, present, and future trends in the agriculture sector from the SDGs perspective. Therefore, a bibliometric study is conducted from 1985 to 2024. Data is extracted from the Scopus database. Results are evident in the increasing trend of publications and citations. The scope of biodiversity finance is not limited to finance but is also theoretically linked with other areas: economics, environmental, and social sciences. The most prominent SDG for framing the research questions is SDG 15 with SDGs (2, 3, 13, 14). The USA is the most productive country, with the highest multiple and single- country productions, and about 60 % of the top ten institutions are in the USA. It included the network and content analysis to explore the homogeneous research areas and determine potential future directions. Furthermore, the study highlighted four research streams: (1) integrated strategies for agricultural financing, development, and governance, (2) strategic approach to biodiversity conservation and financial management, (3) sustainable development and finance, and (4) biodiversity financing for sustainable agriculture. The findings highlight the significance of financial incentives to support sustainable biodiversity management that can help in agricultural revitalization and accomplishing SDGs.

AB  - Global change phenomena, such as forest disturbance and land-use change, significantly affect elemental balances as well as the structure and function of terrestrial ecosystems. However, the importance of shifts in soil nutrient stoichiometry for the regulation of belowground biota and soil food webs have not been intensively studied for tropical ecosystems. In the present account, we examine the effects of land-use change and soil depth on soil and microbial stoichiometry along a land-use sequence (natural forest, pastures of different ages, secondary succession) in the tropical mountain rainforest region of southern Ecuador. Furthermore, we analyzed (PLFA-method) whether shifts in the microbial community structure were related to alterations in soil and microbial stoichiometry. Soil and microbial stoichiometry were affected by both land-use change and soil depth. After forest disturbance, significant decreases of soil C:N:P ratios at the pastures were followed by increases during secondary succession. Microbial C:N ratios varied slightly in response to land-use change, whereas no fixed microbial C:P and N:P ratios were observed. Shifts in microbial community composition were associated with soil and microbial stoichiometry. Strong positive relationships between PLFA-markers 18:2n6,9c (saprotrophic fungi) and 20:4 (animals) and negative associations between 20:4 and microbial N:P point to land-use change affecting the structure of soil food webs. Significant deviations from global soil and microbial C:N:P ratios indicated a major force of land-use change to alter stoichiometric relationships and to structure biological systems. Our results support the idea that soil biotic communities are stoichiometrically flexible in order to adapt to alterations in resource stoichiometry.

AB  - The anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) removes most of the biologically produced methane (CH4) from marine ecosystems before it enters the atmosphere and thus mitigates greenhouse gas emissions. As compared to marine environments, surprisingly little is known about the role of AOM in terrestrial ecosystems. Particularly, how AOM controls the CH4 budget of paddy soils is unexplored, partly reflecting analytical difficulties in analyzing CH4 turnover. To date, the most commonly used method to study AOM in soils is in vitro incubation of microcosms with CH4 injection into the headspace with/without shaking of slurry. Shaking, however, introduces various errors and disturbances. Here we measured AOM in rice paddy soil using a new alternative approach that introduced C-13-labelled CH4 directly into soil slurry via a silicone tube without shaking. The results were compared to those obtained by the classical approaches (i.e., with and without tubes and/or shaking). In all batches, C-13 enrichment of CO2 after (CH4)-C-13 injection clearly confirmed the occurrence of AOM in paddy soil. The cumulative AOM during 84 days reached 0.16-0.24 mu g C g(-1) dry soil without shaking, but it was 33-80% lower with shaking. Unexpectedly, the effect of silicone tubes on AOM was insignificant either with or without shaking, suggesting that the CH4 concentration in water (slurry) was not the main limiting factor for AOM. Without shaking, the controls without CH4 addition revealed a steady increase of CH4 in the headspace/tube, whereas the CH4 concentration in jars with shaking was constantly low during 59 days. This suggests that shaking inhibited methanogenesis. There was a strong linear correlation between the amount of CH4 oxidized and CH4 produced with shaking (R-2 = 0.91), whereas without shaking this relationship followed a power growth regression. Based on the current and reported AOM rates, rough upscale to paddy soils in China showed recycling of ca. 2.0 Tg C of CH4 each year, making AOM a crucial terrestrial CH4 sink.

AB  - This paper examines the determinants of military expenditures with a special focus on political regimes for more than 130 countries for the period of 1963-2000 by employing a dynamic panel data analysis. The paper aims at contributing to the literature by utilizing a recently constructed political regime data set and controlling for income inequality, a key variable that has not received substantial attention in the context of political regimes, economic growth and military expenditures. Covering a large set of countries and an extended time period, the paper reveals further evidence on the linkage between democracy and military expenditures. Our results yield two crucial facts. First, social democratic political regimes have a tendency to spend less on armaments as a share of the national income; compared to social democracy, all other political regimes are likely to have higher military burdens, confirming previous findings of the negative relationship between level of democracy and military burden. Second, the analysis shows that a higher income inequality is associated with a higher military burden. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The goal of this paper is to show how multi-objective programming can be used to generate minimum-cost management alternatives for a real ECOSEL auction where optimal production plans for carbon sequestration, mature forest habitat and timber revenues are to be identified. The case study is suggestive of one of the most sophisticated uses of ECOSEL that might work for some but not all forest landowners. Examples of less involved uses are also given to illustrate low transaction cost applications both within and beyond forestry. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Innovation is a primary aspect of economic growth and development and depends on the ability of entrepreneurs to create economic value by introducing new products or services, designing different production processes or rearranging organisational practices. The spreading of innovation is a key element in all economic sectors, including the forestry sector. Four types of innovation can be found in the forestry sector: product innovations (e. g., wood assortments), service innovations (e. g., biodiversity conservation and forest recreation), technological innovations (e. g., the introduction of new machinery, such as harvesters, processors or forwarders) and organisational innovations (e. g., changes in the production process or in the firm's organisational structure). In this paper, we focus on service innovations linked to tourism and recreation in the forest using a comparative investigation. In particular, three types of recreational innovations in the forest (adventure parks, educational farms, and cultural attractions) were analysed within two case studies located poles apart (Auckland Region in New Zealand and Trentino in Italy). The results of a questionnaire, submitted during face-to-face interviews, to a sample of New Zealand and Italian entrepreneurs indicated the level of innovation in the forestry sector, the elements of weakness and strength of the innovation process, and the potential of the transferability of novelties into each of the two contexts.

AB  - This paper explores various forms of eco-industrial networks in advancing environmental sustainability. Prior research on environmental sustainability primarily identifies industrial actors as autonomous entities or considers the role of networks in advancing environmental sustainability from a rather narrow perspective. However, the networks of ties in which industrial firms are embedded profoundly impacts not only their own performance, but also the natural environment in which they operate. Based on a systematic literature review, we identify four forms of eco-industrial networks that have the potential to advance environmental sustainability: 1) symbiosis networks, 2) sustainable supply networks, 3) environmental issue networks and 4) environmental solution networks. The paper presents important insights on the operational logic for each of these network forms and the dimensions of their network architecture. The main implications of this comparison are that policy-makers and practitioners need to become aware of the various mechanisms through which inter-organisational networks can reduce environmental load. Furthermore, there is a need to build broad coalitions of organisations that are mobilised to address environmental issues. We suggest that network architecture which maximises its members' capability to self-organise while also including a coordinating organisation can be highly suitable for eco-industrial networks. We also suggest some fruitful avenues for future research on eco-industrial networks. In integrating research on eco-industrial networks with existing research on inter-organisational alliances and networks, the paper provides more understanding on the multifaceted role played by various forms of eco-industrial networks in advancing sustainability.

AB  - The Circular Economy represents an essential strategy for a more sustainable future, both for the environment and for the economy and society. The main purpose of this article is to conduct a holistic analysis that highlights Romania's perspectives in the transition and integration process towards the Circular Economy. In this research, we will use economic cybernetics and complex adaptive systems to uncover the complexity of the Circular Economy. Our aim is also to identify the connections and interactions among its various components. To complete this holistic analysis framework, multiple linear regression (MLR) and autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) models were employed. MLR was applied to assess the impact of variables such as Waste per capita, Recycling rate by region, Labor productivity, Production of environmental goods, and Circular material use rate on real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. The time series are extracted from Eurostat databases and cover the period 2010-2021. Given the results obtained through MLR, we applied the ARDL model to study the long-run and short-run causal impact of independent variables on real GDP per capita. The analysis results led us to create an ARDL model from another perspective, namely, to examine how greenhouse gas emissions from production activities and labor productivity per person employed and hour worked affect the generation of municipal waste per capita. Our study delves into the Circular Economy as a pivotal strategy for fostering sustainability, offering an exhaustive, data-backed analysis of its effects on economic performance and environmental health in Romania. In light of our findings, we strongly recommend that future policy development in Romania should be aligned with the National Strategy for the Circular Economy. This would facilitate a more effective transition to sustainable practices, not only enhancing economic indicators but also reducing environmental impact.

AB  - In the actual era of the international trade, global warming and depletion of Earth's natural resources, the willingness to generate sustainable and competitive benefits determines us to stop thinking linearly (produce, consume and dispose) and to shift towards a circular approach by closing material loops. The latter falls within the concept of circular economy that, in turn, derives from reverse logistics. This paper proposes a comprehensive state-of-the-art review around the topic of circular economy and reverse logistics with a particular emphasis on mid-term production planning under discrete time settings. The broad spectrum of reviewed publications is categorized and discussed with respect to the main recovery operations, namely: (i) disassembly for recycling, (ii) from product to raw material recycling, and (iii) by-products and co-production. For each of the aforementioned recovery options, this paper elucidates the related definitions, reviews the mathematical formulations jointly with a structured overview of the solution methods, and discusses their industrial implications. Given the legislative pressure to mitigate environmental impacts caused by production processes, a special attention is paid to the greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. A cross-cutting analysis of the reviewed literature brought forward a number of research gaps and revealed multiple research opportunities to support the development of the circular economy. The key findings show an ever-growing interest in making sustainable the traditional linear industrial processes within a circular economy context. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although there are many methods based on efficiency and equality in allocating discharge permits, developing both reasonable and feasible discharge permit allocation methods remains a challenge. This study proposes an allocation method that aims to achieve equitable allocations with respect to population, land area, environmental receiving capacity, and Gross Domestic Product, which are incorporated into a multi-index Gini coefficient. Previous methodological advances are enhanced by assigning weights to each index using the Analytic Hierarchy Process; and by introducing a new Inequality Factor to quantify the residual inequality. These methods are applied to a case study of chemical oxygen demand discharge permit allocation among 13 cities in Jiangsu Province, China. The allocations obtained by optimizing this method reduce the current level of inequality and are considered more feasible for achieving pollution reduction targets than the equal ratio or average amount benchmark methods. In the case study, the Inequality Factor was used to identify the cities that are the greatest beneficiaries and losers under the allocation scheme. A potential option for improving equality is to relax the constraints imposed on the allocation reductions; however little sensitivity to this was found implying that the limits are not barriers to equality. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to exam the uncertainty in the weights, showing significance for individual cities, but low significance for province-level equality. It is concluded that the integrated use of the Weighted Gini coefficient and Inequality Factor can offer new insights into regional and the city-level equality of discharge permit allocations.

AB  - This study investigated the intersection of healthy and sustainable human settlement, and land use for spa tourism in rural areas. Recognizing the crucial role of youth in shaping the future of tourism, this research aimed to provide an insight into the young local rural community representatives' perception of sustainable spa tourism development and to identify whether these attitudes are shaped by their socio-demographic characteristics. The applied methodology was the Sustainable Tourism Attitude Scale (SUS-TAS). A total of 254 respondents took part in this research. Using SPSS 30.0.0, the gathered data were subjected to additional analyses based on factor analysis, descriptive statistics, and the general linear model. The results showed a general positive attitude of local community members towards the further development of spa tourism in their communities. The especially important factors were the following: long-term planning of development, environmental protection, negative attitudes towards spa tourism development, economic benefits, as well as community participation. By providing an empirical analysis based on the use of robust tools for measuring youth attitudes, this research offers valuable insights for policymakers, planners, and community leaders into how they can design and implement tourism strategies that align with sustainability principles while fostering local economic development and environmental stewardship. The ultimate goal is to contribute to the broader discussion on developing healthy, sustainable human settlements that balance economic benefits with ecological and social well-being. Synergy/harmony between communities and their natural surroundings is essential for the social, economic, and environmental sustainability of rural human settlements. Mineral springs and spas facilitate sensory experiences for individuals (both tourists and residents) through the utilization of natural resources and the environment.

AB  - This article proposes a shift toward the integrated governance of watersheds as a basis for fostering health, sustainability and social-ecological resilience. The authors suggest that integrated watershed governance is more likely when different perspectives, including health and well-being, are explicitly understood, communicated, and sought as co-benefits of watershed management. A new conceptual device - the watershed governance prism - is introduced in relation to the multiple facets of governance that characterize contemporary water resources management and examined as an integrative framework to link social and environmental concerns with the determinants of health in the watershed context. The authors assess the diagnostic and communicative potential of such a framework, discussing its utility as a concise depiction of multiple, interacting policy priorities and as a guide to integrate different research and policy domains into the governance of water, health and social-ecological systems.

AB  - Background: Infant formula (IF) requires further optimization as there are still differences in health consequences between human milk (HM) and IF. Scope and approach: The present review addresses the challenges and future opportunities inherent in the pro-duction of more biomimetic and sustainable IF. After presenting the targets, limitations and challenges for IF optimization, process innovations that could contribute to designing the next-generation of IF are discussed. The final section describes how such improvements should be addressed by means of a more systemic approach. Key findings and conclusions: Gaps in our knowledge of the compounds and structures in HM and their effects on digestion and health still exist, rendering the biomimicry of HM more difficult. Overall, optimizing IF is complex and requires trade-offs between synergistic and conflicting objectives, which include HM biomimicry, safety, functionality, ingredient sourcing as well as environmental, economic and social sustainability issues. Process innovations and optimized technological routes, including minimal processing, offer opportunities to implement new ingredients and improve the preservation of IF compounds, while ensuring microbial safety and addressing several pillars of sustainability through energy costs or reductions in gas emissions. Given the complexity of producing biomimetic and sustainable IF, a multi-objective optimization strategy is proposed, reliant on a multidisciplinary approach, where nutrition and process engineering would play pivotal roles with assistance from other disciplinaries such as biochemistry, microbiology, pediatric medicine, data and consumer sciences and public health. This rethinking of IF production should be driven by a multidisciplinary, non-profit con-sortium involving the entire value chain.

AB  - Forest natural climate solutions such as improved forest management and reforestation have been identified as a cost-effective way to mitigate climate change. Several US states have GHG reduction policies, often citing forests as a key to meeting mitigation targets despite not knowing how specific practices impact carbon and other forest ecosystem services at the regional level. In response, we link a regional forest landscape model (LANDIS -II) with economic and policy data to assess how shifting forest management in Maine, USA, impacts the region's future carbon sequestration, timber supply, biodiversity, and landowner returns. Scenario analysis results show consistent tradeoffs between carbon sequestration and timber supply, with impacts diminished when managers shift to a land-sparing and balanced management approach consisting of permanent set -asides and intensive clearcut with planting regimes. We also estimate that carbon sequestration can increase by 15-25% over the reference case while still maintaining harvest levels by shifting to a broader mix of intensive and extensive practices. Further, we estimate that harvests could grow by 20% above the baseline and still positively affect forest carbon. In all cases, shifts in practices had a mixed impact on biodiversity due to the diverse habitat indicators evaluated for this study. Overall, we find that changes in forest management can lead to improved outcomes for both carbon and other forest ecosystem services of interest, provided managers are given the policy, economic, and social incentives to do so.

AB  - Climate change has become increasingly intertwined with the occurrence and severity of droughts. As global temperatures rise due to greenhouse gas emissions, weather patterns are altered, leading to shifts in precipitation levels and distribution. These exacerbate the risk of drought in many regions, with potentially devastating consequences. A comprehensive transcriptome analysis was performed on Keteki Joha, an aromatic rice from North East India, with the aim of elucidating molecular responses to drought. Numerous genes linked to drought were activated, with both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways playing crucial roles. Upregulated genes were enriched with gene ontology terms with response to abscisic acid and abscisic acid-activated signalling pathway, suggesting the existence of an ABA-dependent pathway for drought mitigation. The upregulated genes were also enriched with responses to stress, water, heat, jasmonic acid, and hydrogen peroxide, indicating the presence of an ABA-independent pathway alongside the ABA-dependent mechanism. Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) identified 267 genes that specifically govern drought mitigation in Keteki Joha. The late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) gene family emerges as the most overrepresented in both RNA sequencing data and WGCNA analysis, suggesting their dominant role in mitigating drought. Notably, 31 LEA genes were induced in seedlings and 32 in mature stages under drought stress. The LEA3-1, LEA14/WSI18, RAB16A, RAB16B, DHN1, DHN6, LEA1, LEA3, LEA17, and LEA33 exhibited and established co-expression with numerous other drought stress-related genes, indicating their inseparable role in alleviating drought. Consequently, LEA genes have been proposed to be primary and crucial responders to drought in Keteki Joha.

AB  - The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to diverse value-added chemicals is a unique, environmentally friendly approach for curbing greenhouse gas emissions while addressing sluggish catalytic activity and low Faradaic efficiency (FE) of electrocatalysts. Here, zeolite-imidazolate-frameworks-8 (ZIF-8) containing various transition metal ions-Ni, Fe, and Cu-at varying concentrations upon doping are fabricated for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to carbon monoxide (CO) without further processing. Atom coordination environments and theoretical electrocatalytic performance are scrutinized via X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Upon optimized Cu doping on ZIF-8, Cu0.5Zn0.5/ZIF-8 achieves a high partial current density of 11.57 mA cm(-2) and maximum FE for CO of 88.5% at -1.0 V (versus RHE) with a stable catalytic activity over 6 h. Furthermore, the electron-rich sp(2) C atom facilitates COOH* promotion after Cu doping of ZIF-8, leading to a local effect between the zinc-nitrogen (Zn-N-4) and copper-nitrogen (Cu-N-4) moieties. Additionally, the advanced CO2RR pathway is illustrated from various perspectives, including the pre-H-covered state under the CO2RR. The findings expand the pool of efficient metal-organic framework (MOF)-based CO2RR catalysts, deeming them viable alternatives to conventional catalysts.

AB  - Ecosystem services (ES) were conceived to emphasize the role of ecological processes in supporting societal needs and to allow their inclusion in the decision-making process. Currently climate change mitigation is one of the most important services ecosystems can provide to enhance sinks of greenhouse gas emissions as the planet warms and related extreme events take their toll on societies. Because ES cannot always be directly measured and because measurements are often cost prohibitive, process-based models are used to estimate their supply, delivery and/or value. We ran the MC2 dynamic global vegetation model for the conterminous US with/without land use for several future scenarios. We translated results into key ES such as carbon sequestration, which contributes to climate regulation, into a regulatory service or aboveground forest carbon into timber biomass, a provisioning service, and evaluated constraints to maintain them. By comparing projections with/without land use we illustrated differences between managed and natural lands and provided information to help the valuation of societally relevant services.

AB  - The worldwide emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a substantial risk to human health and environmental stability. In agriculture, organic amendments (derived from organic sources such as manure, and plant residues) are beneficial in restoring soil properties and providing essential nutrients to crops but raise concerns about harboring antibiotic resistance, which emphasizes the need for vigilant monitoring and strategic interventions in their application. The current study assessed the impact of farming practices (organic and conventional) in a three-year field experiment with pigeonpea-wheat cropping system, focusing on the transmission of AMR using culture-dependent and -independent approaches, and soil nutrient content. Markers for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) (aminoglycoside-aacA, beta-lactam-blaTEM, chloramphenicol-cmlA1, macrolideermB, sulfonamides-sul1, sul2, and tetracycline-tetO) and integrons (intl1 and intl2) were targeted using qPCR. Manure amendments, particularly FYM1, exhibited a higher abundance of copies of ARGs compared to the rhizospheric soil. Organic farming was associated with higher copies of intl2, sul1, blaTEM, and tetO genes, while conventional farming showed increased copies of sul2 and ermB genes in the rhizosphere.

AB  - Climate change and associated Arctic amplification cause a degradation of permafrost which in turn has major implications for the environment. The potential turnover of frozen ground from a carbon sink to a carbon source, eroding coastlines, landslides, amplified surface deformation and endangerment of human infrastructure are some of the consequences connected with thawing permafrost. Satellite remote sensing is hereby a powerful tool to identify and monitor these features and processes on a spatially explicit, cheap, operational, long-term basis and up to circum-Arctic scale. By filtering after a selection of relevant keywords, a total of 325 articles from 30 international journals published during the last two decades were analyzed based on study location, spatio-temporal resolution of applied remote sensing data, platform, sensor combination and studied environmental focus for a comprehensive overview of past achievements, current efforts, together with future challenges and opportunities. The temporal development of publication frequency, utilized platforms/sensors and the addressed environmental topic is thereby highlighted. The total number of publications more than doubled since 2015. Distinct geographical study hot spots were revealed, while at the same time large portions of the continuous permafrost zone are still only sparsely covered by satellite remote sensing investigations. Moreover, studies related to Arctic greenhouse gas emissions in the context of permafrost degradation appear heavily underrepresented. New tools (e.g., Google Earth Engine (GEE)), methodologies (e.g., deep learning or data fusion etc.) and satellite data (e.g., the Methane Remote Sensing LiDAR Mission (Merlin) and the Sentinel-fleet) will thereby enable future studies to further investigate the distribution of permafrost, its thermal state and its implications on the environment such as thermokarst features and greenhouse gas emission rates on increasingly larger spatial and temporal scales.

AB  - Large-scale carbon mapping is needed to support the UNFCCC program to reduce deforestation and forest degradation (REDD). Managers of forested land can potentially increase their carbon credits via detailed monitoring of forest cover, loss and gain (hectares), and periodic estimates of changes in forest carbon density (tons ha(-1)). Satellites provide an opportunity to monitor changes in forest carbon caused by deforestation and degradation, but only after initial carbon densities have been assessed. New airborne approaches, especially light detection and ranging (LiDAR), provide a means to estimate forest carbon density over large areas, which greatly assists in the development of practical baselines. Here I present an integrated satellite-airborne mapping approach that supports high-resolution carbon stock assessment and monitoring in tropical forest regions. The approach yields a spatially resolved, regional state-of-the-forest carbon baseline, followed by high-resolution monitoring of forest cover and disturbance to estimate carbon emissions. Rapid advances and decreasing costs in the satellite and airborne mapping sectors are already making high-resolution carbon stock and emissions assessments viable anywhere in the world.

AB  - The tropical forest cover has varied greatly over the last few decades. The rapid advance of agricultural crops and illegal clearings in natural areas has resulted in the conversion of the majority of the world's forest into desolated patches. Although rates of deforestation have decreased compared to previous years, forest loss still remains a crucial concern. Latest studies conducted on a global scale identified the Latin American continent as one of the regions exhibiting the highest rates of deforestation in the world. The dynamics of forests over the past 40 years has attracted numerous remote-sensing-based studies to monitor forest loss, analyse patterns, and understand the drivers of land conversion. This review article provides a comprehensive overview of the remote-sensing-based studies of tropical forest dynamics in Latin America. Following an introduction with respect to global forest mapping products, a general outline of tropical forest ecoregions and drivers of deforestation in Latin America is provided. Subsequently, a review and categorization of the existing studies is presented, where focus is laid on selected sensors and data analysis methodologies apply. Furthermore, a case study for the whole of Paraguay is presented; Paraguay is a region which contains highly diverse ecosystems that have been ravaged as a result of deforestation over the past 40 years. The main results, challenges, and future needs are discussed.

AB  - 1. The replacement of natural systems with agricultural lands is the main factor resulting in land use change in tropical regions. Tropical savannas cover more than 20% of the global land surface, and one-fifth of the world's population depends directly on these systems.2. Here, we aim to understand how the conversion of tropical savanna into exotic pastures affects the taxonomic and functional metrics of communities and dung removal, using dung beetles as a focal group in a biodiversity hotspot-the Brazilian Cerrado biome. We used species richness, abundance, total biomass, and species composition as assemblage metrics, and functional richness, equitability and dispersion indices, and functional composition as functional diversity metrics.3. The replacement of native savanna with exotic pastures negatively affected taxonomic and functional metrics, suggesting a simplified system where some disturbance-tolerant species become dominant. However, the relationship between dung removal and functional richness was higher in pastures compared to savanna.4. Our results demonstrated that responses of dung beetle assemblages and dung removal to land use changes are decoupled, idiosyncratic and context-dependent, presenting challenges for making predictions and generalisations about the effects of land use change on ecological processes mediated by animals.

AB  - Background: Value added production of polyphenolic rich citrus peels in the form of agricultural waste valorization and as a medicinal herb holds exceptional practicality. Potential applications as natural electron shuttles for bioenergy production further valorizes citrus peels in a bid to promote sustainable energy generation. This first-attempt study thus tended to decipher the stimulating effects of traditional medicinal processing methods to augment the electron mediating capabilities of Citrus reticulate peels.Methods: Dried C. reticulate peels were subjected to stir-frying with individual adjuvants (e.g., vinegar, honey, soil, and bran) and analyzed via phytochemical analysis, antioxidant activity, and anti-inflammatory activity. Moreover, microbial fuel cells were used to evaluate the electron shuttling characteristics of the processed C. reticulate for bioenergy extraction. Significant findings: It was indicated that solid adjuvants (e.g., bran and soil) coupled with stir-frying were found to increase the phytochemical content (e.g., total phenols, flavonoids, and condensed tannins) of C. reticulate peels. Consequently, according to comparative analysis, bran stir-fried extracts with optimal processing methods further stimulate the ES characteristics of C. reticulate for bioenergy extraction. Enhanced power generation capacity was attributed to the chemical and physical changes of the bioactive compounds as a result of the processing methods. Furthermore, principal component analysis reveals that FRAP assay and total flavonoid content serve as a preliminary investigation for revealing the electron transport characteristics of C. reticulate.

AB  - Kazakhstan is country rich in energy resources, but to raise the living standards of the country's population, the government regulates prices of heating energy, which are significantly lower comparing to those in the global energy market. Such an approach encourages the construction of residential buildings without concern for their energy efficiency, which significantly increases energy consumption in the sector and leads to the increase of greenhouse gas emissions into the environment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the impact of regulated low prices of heating energy on long-term energy use in buildings, to determine optimal levels of building thermal insulation at current energy prices and following global energy price trends, and to demonstrate the impact of more efficient building thermal insulation on heating energy consumption from a long-time perspective. The cost-optimal method used in EU countries was chosen for the optimization of building thermal insulation and energy consumption to compare the impact of energy prices on the optimal thermal insulation of buildings. The results of the study showed that maintaining low energy prices hinders the implementation of energy-efficient solutions in buildings and does not provide an economic justification for prolonging the heating season by ensuring the quality of the indoor microclimate. As a practical result of this study, a recommendation was made to introduce optimal thermal insulation requirements in building regulations and to redistribute part of the energy subsidies for implementation of energy-efficient measures in the residential building sector.

AB  - This article describes two different visualisation instruments that can be used for awareness raising and educational purposes: Nitrogenius and the N-visualisation tool. Both instruments aim to convey the complex interactions that occur in the nitrogen (N) cycle and the need for integrated measures when aiming to reduce N-related environmental problems such as eutrophication, acidification or global warming. Nitrogenius was developed in the year 2000. This four-player computer "game" focuses on the Dutch N problems caused by N2O, NH3 and NOx emissions as well as nitrate in surface and ground water. Underlying the glossy user interface is a set of comprehensive models and a database with potential measures that were considered to be feasible at the time. Since 2000, the model has been used for educational purposes annually at Wageningen University. About 150 MSc students played the game, with the aim to solve the N-related problems in the Netherlands. This article analyses these games, and presents the surprising correlation for the period 2000-2007 with the actual environmental trends in the Netherlands. The second tool is an N- visualisation tool that was developed in 2007. This tool provides both a historic overview of the nitrogen issue and demonstrates the effect of seven potential measures on the world wide N cycle. The effects of increased biomass use and intensification of agriculture are examples of included measures. The net effect on global warming, food availability and biodiversity are output parameters of this instrument. The calculations and assumptions underlying this tool are easily accessible through an open source spreadsheet. This tool was used in 2008 and 2009 at Wageningen University for educational purposes. The pros and cons of both games for awareness raising and educational purposes will be discussed.

AB  - Methane, the predominant element in natural gas and biogas, represents a promising alternative to carbon feedstocks in the biotechnological industry due to its low cost and high abundance. The bioconversion of methane to value-added products can enhance the value of gas and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Methanotrophs, methane-utilizing bacteria, can make a significant contribution to the production of various valuable biofuels and chemicals from methane. Type II methanotrophs in comparison with Type I methanotrophs have distinct advantages, including high acetyl-CoA flux and the co-incorporation of two important greenhouse gases (methane and CO2), making it a potential microbial cell-factory platform for methane-derived biomanufacturing. Herein, we review the most recent advances in Type II methanotrophs related to multi-omics studies and metabolic engineering. Representative examples and prospects of metabolic engineering strategies for the production of suitable products are also discussed.

AB  - Enzymatic hydrolysis of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is a chemical recycling approach intended to enable a circular economy for polyesters. To quantitatively compare this technology to other recycling and synthesis approaches for PET, it is critical to conduct rigorous and transparent process analyses. We recently reported a detailed process model that was used to conduct economic, energy, and greenhouse gas emissions analyses for enzymatic PET recycling. Here, we expand upon this previous work by conducting a process-based life cycle assessment (LCA) of the same enzymatic hydrolysis system, to produce both terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG) for use in a closed-loop PET recycling scheme. This LCA shows that enzymatic hydrolysis currently performs 1.2 to 17 times worse than virgin TPA and PET production across most impact categories, excepting ecotoxicity and fossil fuel depletion. The top contributors to these impacts include post-consumer PET collection and processing, sodium hydroxide, and electricity. Sensitivity analysis shows that improving yields throughout the recycling process and eliminating certain process steps, such as amorphization pre-treatment and reaction pH control, can reduce the overall environmental impacts of enzymatic PET recycling to levels statistically equivalent to virgin TPA and PET production, thereby highlighting crucial areas for further research and innovation.

AB  - In the drug -resistance era, phage therapy has received considerable attention from worldwide researchers. Phage therapy has been given much attention in public health but is rarely applied to control plant diseases. Herein, we discuss phage therapy as a biocontrol approach against several plant diseases. The emergence of antibiotic resistance in agriculturally important pathogenic bacteria and the toxic nature of different synthetic compounds used to control microbes has driven researchers to rethink the century -old strategy of phage therapy". Compared to other treatment strategies, phage therapy offers remarkable advantages such as high specificity, less chances of drug resistance, non -harmful nature, and benefit to soil microbial flora. The optimizations and protective formulations of phages are significant accomplishments; however, steps towards a better understanding of the physiologic characteristics of phages need to be preceded to commercialize their use. The future of phage therapy in the context of plant disease management is promising and could play a significant role in sustainable agriculture. Ongoing research will likely affirm the safety of phage therapy, ensuring that it does not harm non -target organisms, including beneficial soil microbes. Phage therapy could become vital in addressing global food security challenges, particularly in regions heavily impacted by plant bacterial diseases. Efforts to create formulations that enhance the stability and shelf -life of phages will be crucial, especially for their use in varied environmental conditions.

AB  - Bangladesh is experiencing deforestation within its protected forest areas (PAs). One reason for its inability to stem deforestation is the lack of a proper understanding of the deforestation process and the drivers responsible for it. This study aims to elucidate the socioeconomic factors influencing deforestation within a PA on the coast of Bangladesh known as Teknaf Wildlife Sanctuary (TWS). In the quest to understand the drivers of deforestation, the extent of community involvement in the deforestation process was explored. The local community was grouped based on their involvement in various deforestation drivers. These groups were then compared to determine the socioeconomic factors influencing the likelihood of their involvement in deforestation. The community survey covered 10% of households in the community surrounding TWS and involved interviewing 5769 household heads. This study found that 2150 households (37% of all surveyed households) were engaged in fuelwood collection, 623 (11%) were encroaching on the TWS, and 506 (9%) were cultivating betel leaves. Therefore, 45% of households were engaged in some form of deforestation driver. Among the socioeconomic factors, new households with small properties had a higher likelihood of being involved in deforestation drivers. Moreover, comparatively poor households had a significantly higher probability of being engaged in deforestation. Regarding occupations, farmers and laborers had a higher likelihood of being associated with deforestation. This study sheds light on the complex interplay of socioeconomic factors influencing the deforestation process occurring within a specific PA in Bangladesh under existing forest policies. This understanding can be useful for policymakers and forest managers in developing effective forest policies and managing forests more sustainably.

AB  - Uncertainties in the 20th century carbon budget associated with the treatment of land use change (LUC) are assessed using the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis (CCCma) first-generation Earth System Model (CanESM1). Eight coupled climate carbon cycle simulations are performed using different reconstructions of 1850-2000 land cover derived from historical information on changes in cropland and pasture area. The simulations provide estimates of the emissions associated with LUC, the relative contribution of changes in cropland and pasture to LUC emissions and the uncertainty associated with differences among historical data sets of crop area as well as in the manner in which the historical land cover data are constructed. The resulting estimates of the amount of biomass deforested over the 1850-2000 period range from 63 to 145 Pg C with cumulative implied LUC emissions ranging from 40 to 77 Pg C. These values of LUC emissions are considerably lower than Houghton's estimate of 156 Pg C. The year 2000 atmospheric CO2 concentration ranges between 371.1 +/- 3.7 ppm depending on the data set used and the manner in which historical land cover is constructed. This compares to the observed value of 369.6 ppm at Mauna Loa and is 17.3 +/- 6.3 ppm larger than for simulations without LUC. Although increases in cropland result in the expected increase in LUC emissions, changes in pasture area decrease these emissions because of carbon sequestration in soils.

AB  - Purpose Homeownership provides shelter and is a vital component of wealth, and house purchase signifies a lifetime achievement for many households. For South Africa confronted with social and structural challenges, homeownership by the low and lower middle-income household is pivotal for its structural transformation process. In spite of these potential benefits, research on the affordable housing market in the context of South Africa is limited. This study aims to contribute to this knowledge gap by answering the question "do changes in household income per capita have a symmetric or asymmetric effect on affordable house prices?" Design/methodology/approach A survey of the international literature on house prices and income revealed that linear modelling that assumes symmetric reaction of macroeconomic variables dominates the empirical strategy. This linearity assumption is restrictive and fails to capture possible asymmetric dynamics inherent in the housing market. The authors address this empirical limitation by using asymmetric non-linear autoregressive distributed lag models that can test and detect the existence of asymmetry in both the long and short run using data from 1985Q1 to 2016Q3. Findings The results revealed the presence of an asymmetric long-run relationship between affordable house prices and household income per capita. The estimated asymmetric long-run coefficients of logIncome[+] and logIncome[-] are 1.080 and -4.354, respectively, implying that a 1% increase/decrease in household income per capita induces a 1.08% rise/4.35% decline in affordable house prices everything being equal. The positive increase in affordable house prices creates wealth, helps low and middle-income household climb the property ladder and can reduce inequality, which provides support for the country's structural transformation process. Conversely, a decline in affordable house prices tends to reduce wealth and widen inequality. Practical implications This paper recommends both supply- and demand-side policies to support affordable housing development. Supply-side stimulants should include incentives to attract developers to affordable markets such as municipal serviced land and tax credit. Demand-side policy should focus on asset-based welfare policy; for example, the current Finance Linked Income Subsidy Programme (FLISP). Efficient management and coordination of the FLISP are essential to enhance the affordability of first-time buyers. Given the enormous size of the affordable property market, the practice of mortgage securitization by financial institutions should be monitored, as a persistent decline in income can trigger a systemic risk to the economy. Social implications The study results illustrate the importance of homeownership by low- and middle-income households and that the development of the affordable market segment can boost wealth creation and reduce residential segregation. This, in turn, provides support to the country's structural transformation process. Originality/value The affordable housing market in South Africa is of strategic importance to the economy, accounting for 71.4% of all residential properties. Homeownership by low and lower middle-income households creates wealth, reduces wealth inequality and improves revenue collection for local governments. This paper contributes to the empirical literature by modelling the asymmetric behaviour of affordable house prices to changes in household income per capita and other macroeconomic fundamentals. Based on available evidence, this is the first attempt to examine the dynamic asymmetry between affordable house prices and household income per capita in South Africa.

AB  - Potential contributions of universities to social innovation are explored with special attention to Southern countries. The normative guide is the notion of Sustainable Human Development understood as stressing the agency of least-advantaged sectors. The main challenges stem from decreasing sustainability and increasing inequality. Their impacts are highly dependent on how the tension between economic growth and environmental protection is managed. Improving actual perspectives demands harnessing advanced knowledge to foster inclusive and frugal innovation. For this to occur, universities need to be main actors. The context in which they act is analyzed with reference to the National Systems of Innovation conceptualization. Possible evolutions of universities as agents of social innovation are discussed with the aid of the Multi-Level Perspective. The importance of the Southern experience of innovating in scarcity conditions is highlighted and illustrated with the specific experience of a Latin American university. The cooperation of universities with weak social actors in ways that involve advanced knowledge appears as a key theoretical issue and as a difficult practical problem for the effective engagement of universities in social innovation. The diverse issues that such engagement needs to integrate conform an ambitious research program, of which the paper aims at giving a first glimpse.

AB  - The 2030 Agenda, represented by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), signifies a global commitment to peace, prosperity, and sustainability. However, the lack of a unified strategy has slowed progress, raising concerns about meeting the 2030 deadline. Thailand's progress toward the SDGs has been influenced by various factors, including the role of the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP). This study uses corporate-level data and Refinitiv ESG ratings as proxies for sustainability performance to assess the impact of SEP score, as a proxy for SEP disclosure, on corporate sustainability. We find that Thai firms with higher SEP scores tend to exhibit better sustainability performance, especially in the environmental and governance dimensions. Our analyses reveal a causal relationship between SEP scores and corporate sustainability performance, with a one standard deviation increase in the SEP score leading to a 35% increase in sustainability performance. The findings support our hypothesis that SEP fosters stakeholder engagement and long-term value creation while aligning corporate strategies with sustainability goals, thereby contributing to the SDGs. Furthermore, the SEP score serves as a nonfinancial indicator that signals a firm's commitment to sustainability strategies.

AB  - In April 2022, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated clearly that without immediate and deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, it would be impossible to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. A growing body of research shows an increasing reaction to witnessing or experiencing current climate impacts and concern regarding apparent inaction in response, manifests as negative cognitive, emotional, and behavioural responses, including eco-anxiety. This commentary contends that nature-based activities (NBAs) have a potentially important, but currently neglected, role to play in supporting those experiencing eco-anxiety. However, existing research limitations hinder their adoption in the United Kingdom's social prescribing agenda and they remain a largely untapped therapeutic resource that need to be mainstreamed into clinical and social care provision. The paper calls for investment in research that advances our understanding of the individual and community benefits of NBAs, the longevity of their impact, and their associated, comparative and opportunity costs.

AB  - Sphagnum mosses dominate peatlands by employing harsh ecosystem tactics to prevent vascular plant growth and microbial degradation of these large carbon stores. Knowledge about Sphagnum-produced metabolites, their structure and their function, is important to better understand the mechanisms, underlying this carbon sequestration phenomenon in the face of climate variability. It is currently unclear which compounds are responsible for inhibition of organic matter decomposition and the mechanisms by which this inhibition occurs. Metabolite profiling of Sphagnum fallax was performed using two types of mass spectrometry (MS) systems and H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 NMR). Lipidome profiling was performed using LC-MS/MS. A total of 655 metabolites, including one hundred fifty-two lipids, were detected by NMR and LC-MS/MS-329 of which were novel metabolites (31 unknown lipids). Sphagum fallax metabolite profile was composed mainly of acid-like and flavonoid glycoside compounds, that could be acting as potent antimicrobial compounds, allowing Sphagnum to control its environment. Sphagnum fallax metabolite composition comparison against previously known antimicrobial plant metabolites confirmed this trend, with seventeen antimicrobial compounds discovered to be present in Sphagnum fallax, the majority of which were acids and glycosides. Biological activity of these compounds needs to be further tested to confirm antimicrobial qualities. Three fungal metabolites were identified providing insights into fungal colonization that may benefit Sphagnum. Characterizing the metabolite profile of Sphagnum fallax provided a baseline to understand the mechanisms in which Sphagnum fallax acts on its environment, its relation to carbon sequestration in peatlands, and provide key biomarkers to predict peatland C store changes (sequestration, emissions) as climate shifts.

AB  - Orthorexia nervosa represents a controversial phenomenon in the realm of eating practices, characterized by an obsessive fixation on consuming only foods deemed 'healthy', and a preoccupation with food purity. While the existing literature has identified the presence of stressful behaviors among individuals with orthorexia, the precise factors and circumstances eliciting these stress-inducing emotions remain the subject of ongoing inquiry. This study aims to explore the triggers and situations that precipitate stressful beliefs and emotions among individuals who self-identify as preoccupied with healthy eating, as well as the coping mechanisms developed to manage these feelings. Through conducting one-to-one interviews with thirteen individuals, thematic analysis was employed to elucidate the nuances of their experiences. Participants articulated concerns regarding the contamination of foods available in supermarkets and restaurants, thereby prompting the meticulous selection of food sources and aversion to dining out. The prospect of trying new foods and engaging in social gatherings involving food emerged as anxiety-inducing scenarios, prompting individuals to adhere to monotonous dietary patterns and impose self-isolation. Additionally, medical appointments were perceived as stressful, driven by health concerns underpinning the adoption of stringent dietary practices. These findings underscore the spectrum of fears and coping mechanisms exhibited by individuals with orthorexia nervosa, which hold profound implications for their overall well-being.

AB  - Brazil contains two-thirds of remaining Amazonian rainforests and is responsible for the most Amazon forest loss. Primary forest loss in the Brazilian Amazon has declined considerably since 2004 but secondary forest loss has never been quantified. We use a recently developed high-resolution land use/land cover dataset to track secondary forests in the Brazilian Amazon over 14 yr, providing the first estimates of secondary forest loss for the region. We find that secondary forest loss increased by (187 +/- 48)% from 2008 to 2014. Moreover, the proportion of total forest loss accounted for by secondary forests rose from (37 +/- 3)% in 2000 to (72 +/- 5)% in 2014. The recent acceleration in secondary forests loss occurred across the entire region and was not driven simply by increasing secondary forest area but probably a conscious preferential shift towards clearance of a little-protected forest ecosystem (secondary forests). Our results suggest that secondary forests loss has eased deforestation pressure on primary forests. However, this has been at the expense of a lost carbon sequestration opportunity of 2.59-2.66 Pg C over our study period. Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon affects both older (primary) and younger (secondary) forests. This study finds that most forest loss over the period 2008-2014 was from secondary forests and that the almost 190% rise in deforestation buffered losses from primary forests.

AB  - The importance of urban biodiversity is debated by many in the conservation community. Some researchers and managers focus on threats to biodiversity associated with urbanization and land use change. In contrast to this approach, people who live in, study, or care about cities-ecologists, wildlife managers, conservation biologists, planners, and local residents-have debated what biodiversity means in urban settings. Recent literature on biodiversity in cities notes the range of ecological, social, and cultural meanings of urban biodiversity and stresses the importance of defining the setting and scales at which biodiversity is being assessed. This approach to urban biodiversity has documented the importance of conservation of rare species and habitats but also the importance of managing the range of habitats in and around where people live, work, and play.

AB  - Recent decades have witnessed some resolution of certain long-standing concerns of urban housing policy. Other issues, including the limited availability of affordable rental units, mortgage finance-related constraints on homeownership, reduced housing and income assistance to very low income populations, and problems of equal opportunity to housing and housing finance, remain at the forefront of the national policy debate. A variety of initiatives provide opportunities for efficiency gains in the pursuit of housing policy goals. These include the reformation of the Federal Housing Administration, consolidation of U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development programs, transformation of the public housing system, enhanced underwriting flexibility by government-sponsored enterprises, and their introduction of new mortgage instruments. However, sizable cuts in federal rental housing and income supports, together with the loss from the stock and the diminished production of low-income rental housing, will undoubtedly result in economic distress among the lowest income renter populations.

AB  - A recent WHO-UN-Habitat document states that urban planning is crucial for better public health in cities and that health is input for and an outcome of planning. These statements regard the mission of urban planning: designing cities to promote a healthy lifestyle and guarantee adequate standards of living and work, economic growth, social development, equity, environmental sustainability and connectivity. In recent decades, health has rarely been promoted directly in urban planning; however, the pandemic has ignited new interest in urban planning as an enabler of urban health, for an approach that may trigger useful innovative elements to better respond to people's needs, improve the quality of life and ensure social equity. This path is still very uncertain. Some people state the need to regulate within urban planning codes, while some warn against restricting local administrations and their capacity to identify unconventional means of innovation, supporting the opportunity to follow a more operational, pragmatic path. This article reflects on current experiments in Europe that propose a 'soft' path to combine health issues and urban planning, innovating with local urban plans within current regulatory grids and relying on greater knowledge and accountability on behalf of designers, administrators, doctors and citizens.

AB  - The planned US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement as well as uncertainty about federal climate policy has raised questions about the country's future emissions trajectory. Our model-based analysis accounts for uncertainty in fuel prices and energy technology capital costs and suggests that market forces are likely to keep US energy-related greenhouse gas emissions relatively flat or produce modest reductions: in the absence of new federal policy, 2040 greenhouse gas emissions range from +10% to -23% of the baseline estimate. Natural gas versus coal utilization in the electric sector represents a key trade-off particularly under conservative assumptions about future technology innovation. The lowest emissions scenarios are produced when the cost of natural gas and electric vehicles declines, while coal and oil prices increase relative to the baseline.

AB  - The fast growing renewable energy market offers opportunities for the traditional forest sector both in Europe in general and Slovakia in particular. The reasoning behind this is twofold. First, in last decade the renewable energy business has gained significant attention. Among other reasons, this is due to the goal of a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Second, changes in downstream markets due to financial crises have put pressure on forest enterprises to redefine their sales portfolios. As marketing can help to realize new opportunities for forestry, the aim of this research study is to shed more light on how forestry enterprises in Slovakia use marketing tools in the trade of forest biomass, the main renewable energy source available to Slovakia. Due to its explorative nature, a case study research design with qualitative methodology has been applied. The capacity for use of marketing tools by (state and private) forest enterprises was explored through in-depth personal interviews analyzed with the help of content analysis. By presenting four detailed cases, the results show that in the forest biomass trade, the forest enterprises all used a marketing mix of "The 5Ps" (product, price, place, promotion, and people) and consequently applied a set of tools different from those observed in other industry sectors.

AB  - Purpose - Cement production has advanced greatly in the last few decades. The traditional fuels used in traditional kilns include coal, oil, petroleum coke, and natural gas. Energy costs and environmental concerns have encouraged cement companies worldwide to evaluate to what extent conventional fuels can be replaced by waste materials, such as waste oils, mixtures of non-recycled plastics and paper, used tires, biomass wastes, and even wastewater sludge. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - The work is based on literature review. Findings - The clinker firing process is well suited for various alternative fuels (AF); the goal is to optimize process control and alternative fuel consumption while maintaining clinker product quality. The potential is enormous since the global cement industry produces about 3.5 billion tons that consume nearly 350 million tons of coal-equivalent fossil and AF. This study has shown that several cement plants have replaced part of the fossil fuel used by AF, such waste recovered fuels. Many years of industrial experience have shown that the use of wastes as AF by cement plants is both ecologically and economically justified. Originality/value - The substitution of fossil fuels by AF in the production of cement clinker is of great importance both for cement producers and for society because it conserves fossil fuel reserves and, in the case of biogenic wastes, reduces greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the use of AF can help to reduce the costs of cement production.

As inventions develop into innovations, they ultimately change the market environment and permit profit making. This paper studies the triggering actions and motivations behind several technological innovations by using the concept of technical norm in structuring and understanding them. The main objective of this paper is to show how the simple formalism of technical norm can have strong explanatory power when explaining technological action. An examination of thirteen cases shows that most inventions and innovations stem from situational constraints and individual determination. Other significant factors are experience, coincidence, understanding of user needs, and adequate financial resources. A brief discussion on innovators' free will concludes this article.

AB  - Metal production and recycling industries are typically characterized by a high demand on energy. Besides this, in the reduction processes necessary in metallurgy, high amounts of reducing agents are also used in this field of the industry. Normally this high demand on carbon is covered by fossil carbonaceous materials, which results in high amounts of greenhouse gas emissions, which in turn enhance global warming. For that reason, companies are being forced by environmental legislation to reduce their carbon footprint. Therefore, one option would be the substitution of fossil based materials with carbon-neutral alternatives. In order to describe some approaches, two options for the utilization of reducing agents based on biomass in heavy metal recycling processes are described in this paper. For that reason biomasses from agriculture like different tree cuttings were converted into metallurgical charcoal by means of a special carbonization reactor. With these charcoals electric arc furnace dust (EAFD) was reduced and recycled in a lab-scale rotary kiln. Furthermore, the by-product of the carbonization process-the pyrolysis gas-was used for the treatment of Waelz slag in a retort process. In both cases, nearly the entire zinc contained in the residue (EAFD and Waelz slag) could be recovered by means of alternative reducing agents. In the retort process also the iron in the remaining slag could be highly metalized. With such a replacement of fossil materials, the CO2 emissions from current dirty industry sectors such as heavy metal recycling can be dramatically reduced. This could lead special industries to be pioneers in matters of environmental protection.

AB  - Molluscs from the Gazul mud volcano and its adjacent areas in the northern Gulf of Cadiz were studied using different sampling methods. This mud volcano has vulnerable deep-sea habitats and a potential high biodiversity. A total of 232 species were identified from the taxocoenosis and thanatocoenosis. of which 86 are new records for the Spanish margin of the Gulf of Cadiz, three of them are new records for Spanish waters and two species are new to science. The high species richness observed could be related to the combination of different sampling methods, the study of the thanatocoenosis, the high habitat heterogeneity and the geographical location of the Gazul mud volcano between different biogeographical regions. The best-represented species were Bathyarca philippiana, Asperarca nodulosa, Leptochiton sp., Astarte stdcata and Limopsis angusta. The thanatocoenosis harboured, with low frequency, species that are typical of northern latitudes, species indicating past seepage, species from the shelf and species restricted to particular hosts. The taxocoenosis found in different areas of Gazul (the mud volcano edifice, erosive depression and adjacent bottoms) generally displayed significant differences in multivariate analyses. Furthermore, the environmental parameters related to environmental complexity and food availability displayed the highest linkage with the molluscan fauna.

AB  - Heterotrophic microalgae culture has given new insights to the commercial biomass and biofuel production. Ultrahigh density microalgae cultures have been reported by many studies in this decade, while the waste management has not been comprehensively addressed in this regime and now a critical environmental concern. For this purpose, current review has attempted to design a close-loop fermentation process by recycling of water and nutrients from waste stream (spent culture media and lipid extracted microalgae biomass slurry) to the secondary microalgae fermentation. The idea of close-loop process is novelty of this study, which has been addressed by qualitative analysis of the existing studies in the fields of photoautotrophic and heterotrophic microalgae cultures along with bacterial and yeast fermentation. Secondary fermentation has challenges of heat based sterilization, excessive salts, organic growth inhibitors, carbon to nitrogen ratio, and turbidity. These problems are resolvable by effective pretreatments (membrane separation, activated carbon and enzymatic hydrolysis), nutrient alternatives and non-heat based sterilization processes. At the end, application of close-loop microalgae fermentation is concluded to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, eutrophication, raw material consumption and biomass production cost of the scale-up heterotrophic microalgae fermentation. The insights of the current review are helpful for the future studies a line with the united nations sustainable development goals SDG 7 and 8.

AB  - The macroalgae, Rhizoclonium hookeri has the ability to grow in fresh and wastewater rich in nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen. Here we have performed the slow pyrolysis of dried R. hookeri at three different thermal rates of 5, 10 and 20 degrees C min-1 from 25 to 800 degrees C using the thermogravimetric technique to get the thermokinetics for its bioenergy value. Four different thermal degradation stages were considered to get the kinetic triplets from its pyrolysis. The activation energy was obtained for each stage of thermal decomposition utilizing four classical isoconversional methods (Friedman, Flynn-Wall-Ozawa, Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose, and Starink). The activation energies obtained through these isoconversional methods for the four valorization zones of R. hookeri were in the range of 151.15-192.62 kJ mol-1. The pre-exponential factor (A) showing the chemical nature of each reaction step was extracted from the kinetic compensation effect and has values in the range of 1.99 x 1020 to 2.63 x 1012 min-1. The thermodynamic parameters revealed the non-spontaneous, endothermic and complex nature of the pyrolysis process of Rhizoclonium biomass. The thermokinetic data showed that Rhizoclonium biomass has bioenergy potential like other macroalgae and is a suitable feedstock for the large-scale pyrolysis process. In conclusion, the outcomes from this study suggest the suitability of Rhizoclonium hookeri as a feedstock for producing bioenergy and is of great significance for designing large-scale equipment to pyrolyze this macroalgal specie.

AB  - The international community considers the possibility of using aid as an instrument to improve natural resource conservation in developing countries. By making the amount of transfers dependent on the efforts of the recipient countries to improve conservation, appropriate incentives can be given. We propose a transfer function in which developing countries are linearly rewarded for having a positive stock of forest, and where the amount of donations is negatively related to the rate of deforestation. This transfer function enables the international community to improve long-term forest conservation as well as the rate of deforestation during the adjustment period.

AB  - The possibility of performing the regeneration of spent fluid catalytic cracking catalysts in rich CO2 atmosphere can simultaneously reduce greenhouse gas emissions and produce CO for sequential uses. Herein alumina modified by vanadium and lithium was revealed a remarkable catalyst (or additive) for this goal. High CO2 conversion was observed in the presence of helium (for instance at 720 and 800 degrees C, 39 and 76% of CO2 was converted during the first 5 min of reaction respectively) and it was reduced by less than 5% in the presence of oxygen. Moreover the catalyst works effectively regardless the coke type on spent catalyst, i.e. produced by means of hydrocarbon or bio feed cracking. This catalyst was tested as an additive and works properly up to one part to ten of spent USY. By means of either labeled CO2 or coke (both with carbon 13) it was shown that primary (CO2)-C-13 forms (CO)-C-13 followed by oxygen mobility between alumina and USY promoting coke oxidation. (CO2)-C-12 formed in-situ similarly to (CO2)-C-13 readily reacts with coke producing CO. These effects improve the coke burning by CO2 and remarkably increase the CO/CO2 ratio even in the presence of O-2. Finally these results strongly support that the FCC regeneration step can be kept under auto-thermal condition in CO2 rich atmosphere. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We model US household debt accumulation during the neoliberal boom (1990-2007) as a response to emulation effects and the decline of the social wage, which has 'privatised' an increasing share of the costs of providing for services such as health and education. The debt dynamics of the US economy are then studied under alternative assumptions about the configuration of distributional variables, which is shown to differ across varieties of capitalism that have 'neoliberalised' to different degrees. A key result is that distributional change alone will not make contemporary US capitalism financially sustainable due, in part, to the paradoxical nature of inequality as a spur to household borrowing, and hence a source of both demand-formation and financial fragility. Achieving sustainability requires, instead, more wide-ranging reform.

AB  - Multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSIs) are often referred to as the 'gold standard' of private governance. However, existing MSIs vary strongly in their institutional designs and the ways in which they use inclusiveness, procedural fairness and, expert-based strategies to create legitimacy for their rules. This article investigates these institutional choices. It reviews arguments about demand from legitimacy-granting audiences, isomorphic pressures, and the role played by institutional entrepreneurs, and intergroup bargaining. It explores these mechanisms in an empirical investigation of the formation of three MSIs in the field of sustainable agriculture. Its findings advance our understanding of the conditions under which MSIs adhere or depart from normative ideals of democratic governance.

Filter theory is interested in a selective function of education and created a different point of view of economic analysis phenomena in education. Signal equilibrium is derived from the Pareto's concept of efficiency and from the differences between private and public educational returns.

AB  - Dryland area accounts for approximately 40% of worldwide land area, which plays a significant role in regulating the carbon sequestration capacity of land. Vegetation restoration in drylands adopted to prevent land degradation, and may also serve as a carbon sink in the earlier stage. However, the persistence of the carbon sink for the revegetated ecosystem in drylands is still unknown. Can the well-established restoration vegetation in dryland areas serve as a carbon sink in long-run? To address this question, we investigated the carbon sequestration capacity of planted vegetation in dryland areas with 13 years of observation (2009-2021) for established vegetation restoration, which began in 1989. We found that the revegetation area serves as a carbon sink in all years. The mean annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP) is 91.61 +/- 36.17 gC m(-2) yr(-1) (mean +/- standard deviation). Annual NEP showed a significant increasing trend over the study period with a rate of 5.65 gC m(-2) yr(-1) yr(-1) (p < 0.05). The increase in spring temperature, the earlier start of net carbon uptake and the longer duration of net carbon uptake contribute to the gradual trend of NEP. The amount of annual NEP is predominantly determined by summer precipitation. Meanwhile, our results revealed that the increase in net carbon uptake by revegetation did not lead to excessive consumption of water resources. Our results have suggested that appropriate vegetation restoration in arid areas can increase ecosystem carbon sequestration over longer timescales and mitigate climate change, with relatively low environmental consequences and risks. Considering the vast area of degraded land in the global drylands, the carbon sequestration effect of this model should be given more attention.

AB  - With the aim of determining the impact on soil caused by deforestation and replacement by pasture in the rainforests of the Venezuelan Andes, three representative plots were selected: one under natural forest (F), another deforested (D), and the third one under pasture (P). The chemical analyses of the soils were complemented with a micromorphological study. The analysis of thin sections revealed major differences in the microstructure and porosity, as well as in the characteristics of the fine fraction and organic constituents, together with other pedological features, corroborating the different dynamics and types of soil in the natural or altered forest landscape. The change in soil use leads to the reorganization of the solid fraction, evidenced in the intensity of the processes of transference and accumulation of materials in the different soil horizons. The results confirm that the change in land use is determinant in the current fertility and evolution of the soils. The main consequences of the land-use change are: a change in the soil organic-matter cycle with a greater degree of maturation in the disturbed soils (C/N in Ah horizon: 28.5 (F); 19.8 (D); 18.4 (P)), in which moder humus from undisturbed forest soils transforms into an acidic mull in the anthropogenic disturbed ones; illuviation of organic matter and minerals appears to have occurred after deforestation (colour (dry-wet) in Ah-Bt1-Bt2 horizons: 3/2-2/2, 4/ 4-3/4, 4.5/4-3.5/4 (F); 5/4-4.5/4, 5/6-4/6, 5/6-4.5/6 (D); 4.5/4-4/3.5, 5/6-4/4, 5/6-4/4 (P)); the amount of kaolinite and the degree of browning increased gradually with deforestation; other changes observed (bioturbation, microstructure, porosity and distribution of organic constituents) may also be related to the different activity of the soil fauna in disturbed (oribatids) and undisturbed soils (worms). Thus the porosity changes in the following form: the percentage of packing voids in the surface samples decreases from a 80% in the forest soil to a 70% and 65% in deforested and pasture soils, respectively. Moreover in depth a dominance of channels in forest-soil porosity changes into an abundance of planar voids in the other two types of soils studied. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Natural wetlands perform essential ecological functions, but their area has dramatically decreased. Partly to counteract this loss, artificial wetlands have been created. While studies comparing animal communities between artificial and natural wetlands abound, research on their comparative ecological functions is scarce. In particular, vertebrate scavengers in aquatic ecosystems have been little studied despite their critical role in nutrient cycling. This study compared vertebrate scavenger assemblages and their consumption patterns in natural and artificial wetlands in Donana, Spain, to evaluate the effects of wetland management (natural vs. artificial hydrology) across different seasons. We placed 120 carcasses (carp and chicken) in natural and artificial wetlands. We recorded 22 vertebrate scavenger species efficiently consuming 100 % of carrion in an average of less than two days, highlighting their role in nutrient recycling. Carrion of aquatic-origin was consumed faster and by a greater variety of species than that of terrestrial-origin, facilitating the transport of essential nutrients from water to land. Artificial wetlands exhibited higher efficiency in carrion removal (twice as fast as natural wetlands). However, they hosted less diverse assemblages, dominated by opportunistic and non-native species. This suggests that artificial wetlands are not replacing natural wetlands in terms of biodiversity, despite sustaining water levels and functions. Importantly, 'kidnapping' water for irrigation reduces the ability of natural wetlands to maintain ecological functions provided by scavengers. Urgent regulation of water abstraction from aquifers, especially for crop irrigation, is necessary to maintain minimum groundwater levels, preserving the functionality and ecological processes of this critical wetland complex.

AB  - Public and private differences have been a central topic in public administration research. This study explores electric utilities' voluntary disclosure of environmental performance and examines if private (investor-owned) and public (government-owned) utilities have different drivers for voluntary disclosure. In particular, this study analyzes the panel data on electric utilities' participation in the Department of Energy's Voluntary Greenhouse Gas Registry program (VGGR) from 1995 to 2005 and attempts to explain the different participation patterns between public and private utilities based on two perspectives-public-private distinction and corporate environmentalism-which probes private firms' voluntary environmental actions in particular. The findings show that private utilities tend to participate in the VGGR program when they have better performance, higher consumer interaction and market pressure, and also when they anticipate further regulations on greenhouse gas emissions. This is consistent with the existing theoretical and empirical studies on corporate environmentalism, which suggests private firms under intensive government regulation and market pressure actively use voluntary disclosure strategy to preempt future regulations and to gain economic benefit or legitimacy. On the other hand, it is found that public utilities tend to participate in the VGGR program when other related mandatory rules exist. This suggests that public utilities' voluntary disclosure is primarily being driven by other mandatory requirements.

AB  - Regular, inclusive, and country-driven Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) of sustainable development goals (SDGs) are being conducted by many countries across the globe in the quest to realign development priorities toward Agenda 2030. However, there are limited studies on the progress of the implementation of SDGs. This paper used literature review and document content analysis to review the VNRs from East Africa for the first time in order to explore their reporting practices and document the progress of SDG implementation. Results substantiate that Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, and South Sudan are committed to achieving a high quality of life for their people through periodic VNR reporting. To augment, these positive efforts, countries have established a favorable multi-stakeholder legal and policy environment for SDG implementation. Moreover, remarkable impacts have been witnessed, including; reduced poverty, improved access to basic services, enhanced environmental protection, improved economic growth, improved gender equality, and improved stakeholder participation in sustainable development. Additionally, global best practices on SDG implementation are emerging from the region, especially through the tendency to formulate national strategies and policies targeting specific development sectors and resources. However, results also show that there are numerous social-political, economic, and environmental barriers to achieving the SDGs. As such, this paper recommends increasing SDGs awareness, building technical capacity, leveraging technology, fostering transparency and accountability, encouraging collaboration, addressing cultural barriers, and supporting political stability. Implementing these interventions can help to promote sustainable development in the region. Key Lessons from East African Countries on Achieving Sustainable Development Goals[Purpose] This paper seeks to review the voluntary national reviews (VNRs) for East African states to document the progress of implementation (achievement, impacts, and barriers), identify similar features in the reviews, and make suggestions for future studies in East Africa. [Methods] The paper has applied a sound and well-designed methodology, clearly describing the methods used and how they were applied. The methodology is appropriate to the research question and is able to withstand scrutiny and replication. [Conclusions] The paper recommends increasing SDGs awareness, building technical capacity, leveraging technology, fostering transparency and accountability, encouraging collaboration, addressing cultural barriers, and supporting political stability. [Implications] There are limited studies on the progress of the implementation of SDGs, especially in East African member states. The paper summarizes the VNRs outlook and then delves into the progress of SDG implementation in the country cases. [Limitations] Despite the few study limitations, particularly the lack of data for South Sudan and the extent of reference documentation, implementing the highlighted interventions can help promote sustainable development in the East Africa region.

AB  - Fungi and their natural products, like secondary metabolites, have gained a huge demand in the last decade due to their increasing applications in healthcare, environmental cleanup, and biotechnology-based industries. The fungi produce these secondary metabolites (SMs) during the different phases of their growth, which are categorized into terpenoids, alkaloids, polyketides, and non-ribosomal peptides. These SMs exhibit significant biological activity, which contributes to the formulation of novel pharmaceuticals, biopesticides, and environmental bioremediation agents. Nowadays, these fungal-derived SMs are widely used in food and beverages, for fermentation, preservatives, protein sources, and in dairy industries. In healthcare, it is being used as an antimicrobial, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and immunosuppressive drug. The usage of modern tools of biotechnology can achieve an increase in demand for these SMs and large-scale production. The present review comprehensively analyses the diversity of fungal SMs along with their emerging applications in healthcare, agriculture, environmental sustainability, and nutraceuticals. Here, the authors have reviewed the recent advancements in genetic engineering, metabolic pathway manipulation, and synthetic biology to improve the production and yield of these SMs. Advancement in fermentation techniques, bioprocessing, and co-cultivation approaches for large-scale production of SMs. Investigators further highlighted the importance of omics technologies in understanding the regulation and biosynthesis of SMs, which offers an understanding of novel applications in drug discovery and sustainable agriculture. Finally, the authors have addressed the potential for genetic manipulation and biotechnological innovations for further exploitation of fungal SMs for commercial and environmental benefits.

AB  - Land surface schemes (LSSs) in Earth System Models simulate how vegetation regulates land-atmosphere fluxes of heat, water, carbon, and momentum. Despite advances in the spatial resolution of regional climate modeling, significant land cover changes occured at sub-grid scale still not properly treated. Here, we investigate the response of evapotranspiration, representing the fluxes of heat and water, to deforestation in Southeast Asian Massif by employing three LSSs (Noah mosaic, Noah-MP and Community Land Model (CLM)) with different approaches in representing sub-grid variability, implemented in the Weather Research and Forecasting model. Two experiments, with and without satellite-observed deforestation, were performed for each scheme. Results show that the simulations are highly sensitive to the subgrid-scale approaches embedded in the LSSs. Compared with the observed historical climate, CLM outperforms other schemes and Noah mosaic shows the largest bias. However, if we target the simulation of the climate impacts of land cover change, the Noah mosaic scheme taking the sub-grid approach can better capture the response of evapotranspiration to deforestation. The NoahMP and CLM schemes underestimate the evapotranspiration response in the grid cells where the dominant land cover type has not changed, but overestimate the response in those grid cells with dominant type changed, which is a characteristic of dominant-grid approach. To improve our understanding of climate impacts induced by fine-scale land cover change, future efforts to better represent subgrid-scale variability and land-atmosphere flux exchange in climate models are desirable.

AB  - The electrochemical reductive valorization of CO2, referred to as the CO2RR, is an emerging approach for the conversion of CO2-containing feeds into valuable carbonaceous fuels and chemicals, with potential contributions to carbon capture and use (CCU) for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Copper surfaces and graphene-embedded, N-coordinated single metal atom (MNC) catalysts exhibit distinctive reactivity, attracting attention as efficient electrocatalysts for CO2RR. This review offers a comparative analysis of CO2RR on copper surfaces and MNC catalysts, highlighting their unique characteristics in terms of CO2 activation, C-1/C2(+) product formation, and the competing hydrogen evolution pathway. The assessment underscores the significance of understanding structure-activity relationships to optimize catalyst design for efficient and selective CO2RR. Examining detailed reaction mechanisms and structure-selectivity patterns, the analysis explores recent insights into changes in the chemical catalyst states, atomic motif rearrangements, and fractal agglomeration, providing essential kinetic information from advanced in/ex situ microscopy/spectroscopy techniques. At the end, this review addresses future challenges and solutions related to today's disconnect between our current molecular understanding of structure-activity-selectivity relations in CO2RR and the relevant factors controlling the performance of CO2 electrolyzers over longer times, with larger electrode sizes, and at higher current densities.

AB  - In this study, the hydrochemistry-runoff method and remote sensing estimation method were used to calculate the karst carbon sink flux (KCSF) and the forest vegetation carbon sequestration flux (FVCSF) in Darongjiang (DRJ) and Lingqu (LQ) watersheds. The results show the following: (1) The KCSF in DRJ and LQ watersheds is 238.43 x 10(5) t<middle dot>y(-1) and 353.44 x 10(5) t<middle dot>y(-1), respectively. Influenced by changes in flow rate, the two watersheds both show that their KCSF is higher in the rainy season than in the dry season. (2) The FVCSF in DRJ and LQ watersheds was 680.78 x 10(7) t<middle dot>y(-1) and 229.63 x 10(7) t<middle dot>y(-1), respectively. Through comparison, it can be seen that the FVCSF is much higher than the KCSF in both watersheds, but the FVCSF and the KCSF are at the same order of magnitude. (3) Through further analysis of the influence factors on the FVCSF and the KCSF, we found that the highest values of FVCSF are mainly distributed around Kitten Mountain on the upper reach and along the LQ watershed. That may be because most of the upper reach areas are mountainous forestland, and the strong weathering of rocks in the LQ watershed promotes the development of forest vegetation carbon sequestration. Therefore, it can be inferred that there is a certain synergistic effect between the karst carbon sink (KCS) and the forest vegetation carbon sequestration (FVCS) in the study area, and such a synergistic effect is caused by rock weathering.

AB  - Landscapes of lakes have a significant impact on people's perceptions of Cultural Ecosystem Services (CES), as well as on their overall sense of well-being. However, there is limited understanding of how best to manage land landscapes and how different approaches influence these perceptions. To explore these questions, a case study of China's Qiandao Lake was conducted, using a survey of 416 tourists and residents based on the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) framework. The relationship between CES and Human Well-Being (HWB) was examined using Structural equation Modeling (SEM), followed by the application of the Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) method to identify which aspects should be targeted in management strategies. The results revealed several key findings. Firstly, there were significant differences in satisfaction with CES between tourists and residents. Tourists showed higher satisfaction levels in spiritual service, aesthetic service, inspiration, and education and science aspects. In contrast, residents prioritized cultural heritage and sense of place, indicating a deeper connection to the cultural and historical elements of their environment. Secondly, age, education, and income levels played important roles in shaping perceptions of CES. Thirdly, the study underscored the impact of CES on HWB, with aesthetic service having the greatest influence on tourists' HWB, and spiritual service having the most impact on residents' HWB. Lastly, using the IPA model, indicators with low satisfaction but high importance were identified, suggesting areas for improvement, particularly in cultural integration and unique environmental features. These research findings provide scientific and theoretical support for the management and landscape planning of lake ecosystems.

AB  - High-strength wastewaters from a variety of sources, including the food industry, domestic septage, and landfill leachate, are often hauled to municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for co-treatment. Due to their high organic loadings, these wastewaters can cause process upsets in both a WWTP's liquid and solids treatment trains and consume organic treatment capacity, leaving less capacity available to service customers in the catchment area. A novel pre-treatment method, the Waste Activated Sludge-High Rate (WASHR) process, is proposed to optimize the co-treatment of high-strength wastewaters. The WASHR process combines the contact stabilization and sequencing batch reactor processes. It utilizes waste activated sludge from a municipal WWTP as its biomass source, allowing for a rapid start-up. Bench-scale treatment trials of winery wastewater confirm the WASHR process can reduce loadings on the downstream WWTP's liquid and solids treatment trains. A case study approach is used to confirm the economic viability and environmental sustainability of the WASHR process compared to direct co-treatment, using life-cycle cost analyses and greenhouse gas emissions estimates.

AB  - Increased urbanization worldwide has resulted in a substantial increase in energy and material consumption as well as anthropogenic waste generation. The main source for our current needs is petroleum refinery, which have grave impact over energy-environment nexus. Therefore, production of bioenergy and biomaterials have significant potential to contribute and need to meet the ever increasing demand. In this perspective, a biorefinery concept visualizes negative-valued waste as a potential renewable feedstock. This review illustrates different bioprocess based technological models that will pave sustainable avenues for the development of biobased society. The proposed models hypothesize closed loop approach wherein waste is valorised through a cascade of various biotechnological processes addressing circular economy. Biorefinery offers a sustainable green option to utilize waste and to produce a gamut of marketable bioproducts and bioenergy on par to petro-chemical refinery. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Chemical recycling has the potential to reduce the environmental impacts from waste plastics, mitigate climate change, and contribute to circular economy. This study compares the environmental and economic performance of two such technologies, fast pyrolysis and gasification, with conventional disposal methods for treating polypropylene ( PP) waste. High-fidelity process simulations for each technology are conducted to obtain the necessary mass, energy, and economic data for subsequent analyses. Through an extensive life cycle assessment utilizing the IPCC 2013, ReCiPe, and ILCD 2.0 methods, fast pyrolysis and gasification are determined to have lower overall greenhouse gas emissions and better overall environmental performance than the conventional methods of incineration and landfilling. The chemical recycling systems are also found to be considerably profitable with fast pyrolysis and gasification having total NPVs of $149MM and $96MM, respectively. The discount rate, waste PP price, and plant life are the most influential factors for the economic performance of both systems.

AB  - Studies on the environmental footprints of agricultural production have strong links with 4 out of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) established by the United Nations. Irrigation systems are essential tools for increasing agricultural yields, particularly in arid regions. However, the production and assembly of these systems can have significant environmental impacts, including excessive water consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Although studies have approached biomass production, few of them have provided data about asset depreciation, such as irrigation systems, machinery, etc. Trying to fill this gap, this study aimed at determining the water and carbon footprints of two commonly used irrigation systems: center pivot and drip. Several variables, including the irrigated area, pump power, filter type, system flow, and pipe length, were analyzed to determine the carbon and water footprints of each component of the irrigation systems. The results reveal that the materials used for pipes and filters had the most significant impact on the water and carbon footprints, with galvanized steel pipes and sand filters having the highest footprints. Additionally, the irrigated area affected the center pivot and drip systems differently, with the depreciation of the irrigation systems being a significant variable for both water and carbon footprints. These results can support the development of sustainable irrigation practices that reduce environmental impacts while enhancing agricultural yields. Decision-makers can use this information to establish a life-cycle database and evaluate the impact of irrigation systems on water and carbon footprints.

AB  - Expanding populations, intensive agriculture, climate change, water pollution and depleting natural water resources are the main drivers of water scarcity in India. Improvisations in wastewater treatment processes for the degradation of pollutants by cost-effective means are critical to ensure safe wastewater discharge and its reuse. While advancements in technology and science have provided alternatives to the traditional activated sludge process; owing to lack of infrastructure, funding and awareness; the majority of wastewaters being discharged remain untreated. Depletion of groundwater and its pollution threatens human well-being, food production, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem balance and climate change. Previous urban planning programs such as Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission laid the foundation for today's water infrastructure and policies for water management. Dedicated ministries and programs execute wastewater treatment and discharge, river and lake rejuvenation, groundwater management and wastewater reuse. This review highlights the existing scenario of wastewater treatment with respect to its discharge and reuse in India. Technocratic involvement of limited stakeholders in the management of the multifaceted issue of water management will further require collaborations and collective action with public and private partners for a robust ecosystem and climate-resistant water management. Key considerations in wastewater treatment, groundwater management, existing knowledge gaps, and policies for water management in India are discussed.

AB  - The world is facing the greatest and most complex twin challenges of water insecurity: scarcity and excess, with their adverse consequences on health, well-being, and developmental outcomes. Against this backdrop, we analyzed the challenges households face due to "too much and too little water'. The research employed a qualitative methodology in which data were collected through 40 key informant interviews, informal conversations, and observations during 2020-2021 including a relevant literature review. We note that both "too much and too little water' pose risks to water insecurity. Also, water security cannot be ensured by only dealing with water inadequacy without building a resi-lient water system and robust institutions. We found that water scarcity has affected other components of water security such as equity, quality, and affordability. Excess water has impacted water infrastructures degrading the water quality, and risking human health and well-being. The responses to the water challenges were hindered by several constraints such as the limited capacity of the water institutions, frequent leadership changes, political influence, and emerging challenges in the federal context. We suggest timely planning and adopting site-specific innovations to address water scarcity and excess challenges, which include strengthening water infrastructures, water supply services, water institutions, and governance.

AB  - This review aims at giving a picture of the progress of the UK wave energy and suggesting key steps needing to be taken for its contribution to the Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions target by 2050. It follows consultation through scoping wave energy workshops held by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) in August 2019 and by Supergen Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) Hub in January 2020 and a series of structured interviews with academics, policy-makers, funding bodies and industry professionals. It is believed that the UK has excellent wave resources and advanced techniques that need to be rapidly developed to achieve the target of 22 GW of installed capacity by 2050 Greaves et al. (2020). The wave energy resources in the UK are reviewed, summarising wave energy hotspots for development and identifying openly accessible wave data. The progress and achievements of wave energy development in the UK are reviewed and described to underline the important roles that UK government and industry support have to play in securing a leading position in wave energy. The potential benefits of wave energy for the decarbonisation of UK industry (including utility scale and niche markets) to achieve Net Zero target by 2050 are presented, as well as the steps that need to be taken in the next 30 years to achieve its potential.

AB  - In cities around the world, achieving greater environmental sustainability is increasingly accompanied by economic motivations. This is illustrated in Stockholm, Sweden, Europe's first Green Capital (2010), where an important aspect of the city's contemporary environmental success has been the development and promotion of flagship eco-district projects. Packaging the environmental sustainability and marketability of these development projects has been part of a concerted strategy in Stockholm, one shared by numerous cities around the world. But to what extent can eco-districts contribute to economic growth? Despite implicit policy motivation, a concise approach to connecting and measuring these issues has yet to be established. Based on an examination of two eco-district developments, this paper combines a qualitative commentary consisting of company-specific interviews with and analysis of productivity of regional cleantech firms in an effort to verify the connection between Stockholm's eco-districts and the growth of its cleantech sector. Through this mixed methods approach, promising opportunities to assess the economic impact that eco-districts can have on local eco-innovation sectors have emerged. This type of information can be used to support wider public initiatives in eco-district projects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Human well-being is a necessary prerequisite for achieving sustainable development. This assumption aligns with the basis of Maslow ' s pyramid of needs and the Kuznets curve in its ecological presentation. Therefore, the presented paper aims to clarify what impact specific indicators of human well-being have on the reported level of sustainability achieved on a macroeconomic scale in the Visegrad Group in the years 2005-2021 and verify whether the author ' s assumptions are correct. Methodology/Approach: Following the correlation analysis of selected variables, there is a linear regression model used to examine the relationship between the overall result of the V4 countries and the selected variables. Findings: People in V4 countries need to have their basic personal needs fulfilled to promote sustainability. Within the analysed variables, the most significant influence on the country ' s sustainability has the Employment rate, the Gender wage gap, and perceived Health. Research Limitation/implication: This study examines the situation within the Visegrad Group, and only 13 variables are selected for the analysis. Originality/Value of paper: The paper deals with the macroeconomic perception of sustainability and sustainable development in connection to human well-being in V4 countries. The potential linkage between overall sustainable countries ' performance based on SDGs fulfilment and human well-being presented by OECD Social and Welfare Statistics is analysed.

AB  - In the last two decades, pollution in the river Ganga has become a serious issue, affecting the socio-economic activities and the health of the communities living on the banks and adjacent areas of the river. The impact has been greater on women, because their day-to-day activities for survival are intimately connected with this water resource. The response of the government has been to drastically improve its environmental policies. Social activists on the other hand continued to mobilize civil society in regional protests, which finally led to the beginning of the 'Save Ganga' movement. Yet, both the strategies to clean the river pollution have been colossal failures. An analysis was undertaken of various government policies, reports and court judgements on the river's pollution and a primary survey was done on three sites: Garhwal in Uttarakhand and in Varanasi and Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh to gauge the nature of women's participation in the movements. It was found that there was greater participation by women in the hilly Garhwal region than in the plains of Uttar Pradesh. The research proved that women's knowledge and experiences in environmental conservation had led to greater sustainability, in contrast to the results of the modern-technocratic approach of state officials and so-called environmentalists. The article seeks to locate the failure of the project of cleaning the river to the lack of gender sensitive environmental policies and insufficient participation of women in ecological activism.

AB  - Social sustainability is concerned with the wellbeing and flourishing of societies now and in the future. Despite its importance, it has been largely overlooked compared with environmental and economic dimensions of sustainability. Additionally, although there is a longstanding history of design being used to tackle social and sustainability problems, the concept of design for social sustainability is not well-understood. In light of this, the current study aims to conceptually develop design for social sustainability. It specifically focuses on how this concept can be developed for the design of product-service systems. A systematic literature review of social design and sustainable design literature is conducted to synthesise fragmented knowledge on design for social sustainability. A total of 69 articles are analysed with respect to terminology, context, methods, focus and key themes. In doing so, it helps to summarise current knowledge and identify several promising areas for further research. In particular, it calls for additional contextual and place-based perspectives; development of appropriate metrics, methods and tools; and research on the linkages between design for social sustainability and existing sustainable design approaches and methods. This article contributes to knowledge in three ways: (1) it integrates disparate knowledge on design for social sustainability within the domain of product-service systems, (2) it defines design for social sustainability and makes progress toward operationalising the concept by identifying its key dimensions, and (3) it identifies current gaps in the literature and highlights areas for further research. This study is important for designers of product-service systems because it sheds a light on what is desirable and achievable.

AB  - Counter-wildlife crime (CWC) interventions-those that directly protect target wildlife from illegal harvest/persecution, detect and sanction rule-breakers, and interdict and control illegal wildlife commodities-are widely applied to address biodiversity loss. This systematic map provides an overview of the literature on the effectiveness of CWC interventions for conserving African, Asian and Latin American wildlife directly threatened by exploitation, including human-wildlife conflicts that trigger poaching. Following our systematic map protocol (Rytwinski, ockerman, et al., 2021), we compiled peer-reviewed and grey literature and screened articles using pre-defined inclusion criteria. Included studies were coded for key variables of interest, from which we produced a searchable database, interactive map and structured heatmaps. A total of 530 studies from 477 articles were included in the systematic map. Most studies were from Africa and Asia (81% of studies) and focused on African and Asian elephants (16%), felids (14%) and turtles and tortoises (11%). Most evaluations of CWC interventions targeted wildlife products (rather than species) and the transfer of those products along the wildlife crime continuum (40% of cases). Population/species outcomes were most commonly measured via indicators of threat reduction (65% of cases) and intermediate outcomes (25%). We identified knowledge clusters where studies investigated the links between (1) patrols and other preventative actions to increase detection and population abundance and (2) information analysis and sharing and wildlife crime/trade levels. However, the effectiveness of most interventions was not rigorously evaluated. Most investigations used post-implementation monitoring only (e.g. lacking a comparator), and no experimental designs were found. We identified several key knowledge gaps including a paucity of studies by geography (Latin America), taxonomy (plants, birds and reptiles), interventions (non-patrol-based CWC interventions) and outcomes (biological and the combination of biological and human well-being outcomes). Our map reveals an opportunity to improve the rigour and documentation of CWC intervention evaluations, which would enable the evidence-based selection of effective approaches to improve wildlife conservation and national security. Results of our systematic map indicate that despite a relatively large evidence base on the effectiveness of counter-wildlife crime (CWC) interventions for conserving wildlife, most interventions have not been rigorously evaluated. Studies often lacked comparators and experimental designs. We also identify several knowledge gaps that deserve further study, including further investigations in Latin America, on plants, birds and reptiles, for non-patrol-based CWC interventions, and in relation to biological, and the combination of biological and human well-being outcomes. Our assessment of the evidence base provides important first steps towards improving our understanding of CWC intervention effectiveness and making evidence-informed management and funding decisions.image

AB  - In the past, historians tended to perceive the global as a set of encompassing processes that made the world smaller and generated an upward trajectory of economic development in the industrialized countries, as we saw in the nineteenth and the better part of the twentieth centuries. At the core of the processes were the technological innovations, the rise of humanism, and the emergence of democratic systems, all of which were closely associated with western European culture. Only recently, have we begun to comprehend not only the multiplexity of the global, but also the deterritorialized, dispersed, and regionalized nature of global change. In this article, I suggest that the global is only the reification of the local. Instead of studying the global, we should focus on the changes in the local societies.

AB  - China is undergoing a rapid urbanization process, and urbanization will have a direct impact on regional ecosystems and affect regional ecosystem services. Considering the mountainous counties in Southwestern China as the research object, this study reveals the spatial clustering characteristics of four typical ecosystem services (food production, soil conservation, water yield and carbon sequestration) as well as the trade-offs and synergies among ecosystem services in different urbanized areas. At the same time, piecewise linear regression is used to determine the threshold of the influence of urbanization on ecosystem services. The results indicate that: 1) There are spatial autocorrelations among the four typical ecosystem services; with strong clustering characteristics, the positive correlation types are "clustered" locally; and with significant spatial heterogeneity, the negative correlation types are scattered and mainly appear in the highly urbanized area. 2) There are also remarkable differences in the relationship among various ecosystem services in different urbanized areas, and in particular, there are marked trade-offs between food production and carbon sequestration in the moderately urbanized area and the highly urbanized area. However, there are synergies between them in the lowly urbanized area. 3) With an increase in the compounded night light index (CNLI), water yield, carbon sequestration, food production and overall ecosystem services values present an increasing-decreasing trend, the soil conservation function value shows a decreasing-increasing trend. The response of water yield, carbon sequestration, food production, and overall ecosystem services to the compounded night light index (CNLI) has a threshold of 1.2642, 1.4833, 1.3388, 1.5146 and 1.2237, respectively. Based on the detected relationships between urbanization and ecosystem services, this study provides a theoretical reference for the selection of urbanization development models in key ecological functional areas.

AB  - Governments must cope with the enormous uncertainties about both future climate change as well as the costs and benefits of slowing climate change. This study analyses the value of improved information about a variety of geophysical and economic processes. The value of information is estimated using the ''PRICE model'' which is a probabilistic extension of earlier models of the economics of global warming. The study uses five different approaches to estimating the value of information about all uncertain parameters and about individual parameters. It is estimated that the value of early information is between $1 and $2 billion for each year that resolution of uncertainty is moved toward the present. We estimate that the most important uncertain variables are the damages of climate change and the costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Resolving the uncertainties about these two parameters would contribute 75 percent of the value of improved knowledge.

AB  - The IPCC Special report on "Global Warming of 1.5 degrees C '' identifies the greenhouse gas emissions trajectories compatible with the global mitigation goal of the Paris Agreement, presents the mitigation actions required to follow these trajectories and analyses the synergies and trade-offs with sustainable development objectives. The assessment highlights the necessity to implement drastic global carbon emissions reductions in the short term, to reach global carbon neutrality between 2050 and 2070 and to implement targeted actions to limit other greenhouse gases. To this aim, rapid and far-reaching transformations are required in energy, industrial, infrastructure and land-use systems. Adopting systemic strategies combining policy packages elaborated according to the specificities of each country context and with a long-term perspective is a requirement for ensuring that these low-emission transformations can be compatible with the achievement of socio-economic and development objectives.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) are considered essential for biodiversity conservation, and concerns about the effectiveness of PAs in terms of reducing deforestation are growing. However, few studies have identified the management measures that best reduce deforestation within existing PAs. Here, we carried out 10-year (from 2007 to 2016) field surveys and obtained a database of 10 management measures of 227 PAs mainly protecting forest ecosystems in China. We examined the contributions of the above 10 management measures in relation to the effectiveness of 227 PAs in reducing deforestation. Our results indicated that 52.68% of PAs had positive effects related to reducing deforestation (E > 0, P < 0.05). while 16.52% of PAs had negative effects (E <0, P < 0.05). The most important management measures affecting the effectiveness of PAs in reducing deforestation were funding, infrastructure, and scientific research and monitoring. Thus, our study provides evidence indicating that improved funding and scientific research benefit the effectiveness of PAs. The findings have global implications for guiding PAs to take explicit measures to improve the outcomes of biodiversity conservation. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wildfires burn more than 7 million acres in the United States annually, according to the US Forest Service. Little is known about which subpopulations are more vulnerable to health risks from wildfire smoke, including those associated with fine particulate matter. We estimated exposure to fine particles specifically from wildfires, as well as the associations between the presence of wildfire-specific fine particles and the amount of hospital admissions for respiratory causes among subpopulations older than 65 years of age in the western United States (2004-2009). Compared with other populations, higher fractions of persons who were black, lived in urban counties, and lived in California were exposed to more than 1 smoke wave (high-pollution episodes from wildfire smoke). The risks of respiratory admissions on smoke-wave days compared with non-smoke-wave days increased 10.4% (95% confidence interval: 1.9, 19.6) for women and 21.7% (95% confidence interval: 0.4, 47.3) for blacks. Our findings suggest that increased risks of respiratory admissions from wildfire smoke was significantly higher for women than for men (10.4% vs. 3.7%), blacks than whites (21.7% vs. 6.9%), and, although associations were not statistically different, people in lower-education counties than higher-educated counties (12.7% vs. 6.1%). Our study raised important environmental justice issues that can inform public health programs and wildfire management. As climate change increases the frequency and intensity of wildfires, evidence on vulnerable subpopulations can inform disaster preparedness and the understanding of climate change consequences.

AB  - The 1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act established mandatory fuel economy standards for passenger ears and light trucks sold in the US. Since that time the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards have often been criticized as costly, inefficient, and even unsafe, despite the general absence of direct empirical evidence to support such claims. This paper reviews empirical evidence on the impacts of the CAFE standards and explains why properly designed and executed fuel economy regulations may be preferable to other policies for reducing petroleum dependence and carbon emissions. It appears that the standards substantially achieved their objective of restraining US oil consumption without producing significant negative side-effects because they were set at levels that could be achieved by cost-effective or nearly cost-effective technological innovations.

AB  - In 2002, the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) established a voluntary environmental program called the Climate Leaders (CL) Program. Participating firms developed greenhouse gas emissions inventories, set emissions reductions goals, and annually reported progress toward those goals. While the program was not designed to function as an eco-labeling program, one possible motivation for participation in the program was to positively influence consumer perceptions for firm products and services. USEPA discontinued the CL program in 2011. In this study, data from a contingent choice experiment from a national online survey are used to examine whether the CL program could have been effectively adopted as a consumer product labeling program. Results suggest that consumers are willing to pay more for refrigerators manufactured by CL program participants and that willingness-to-pay is influenced by both respondent characteristics and attitudes.

AB  - Over the last decades the harnessing of wind power has gained increasing popularity and is currently believed to be one of world's best environmental options in seeking to meet the international target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least half by the year 2050. There is undeniably an abundance of wind resources in Iceland. But what impact would the harnessing of this power have on the country's growing tourism industry? This paper focuses on the dynamics existing between wind farming, residents and tourism. Its overall aim is to evaluate the attitudes of local residents and tourism service providers in Southern Iceland towards the country's first proposed wind farm, which is to be located at the edge of Iceland's Southern highlands, and to critically discuss the causal relationship between the landscape and these attitudes. An on-site questionnaire was distributed to residents in the municipalities adjacent to the proposed wind farm. Interviews were also conducted with residents and tourist service providers. The results indicate that the relationship between residents and the landscape of the proposed site is based on its use as highland pasture and the residents' romantic conception of the landscape, which for centuries has been characterized by wildness and remoteness. This conception seems to linger on despite gradually increasing hydropower production in the area. The associations made by tourist service providers with the area differ since they are selling a certain image, that of unspoilt nature and wilderness. Wind turbines would be a new and prominent presence in the Icelandic landscape likely to transform the area from its previous perceived wild and natural state. As such, social acceptance of the location of wind farms in the Icelandic highlands is more critical than in the case of more traditional ways of harnessing renewable energy.

AB  - The development of the installed capacity of wind energy converters in Germany shows that a significant increase of its contribution to the energy supply is possible, depending on the measures introduced by the state. In contrast to Germany, Brazil has not been very concerned about its greenhouse gas emissions yet, as more than 90% of the electricity is generated by hydropower. However, due to the current energy crisis Brazil has to search for alternatives in order to stabilize the energy matrix and diminish the dependence on precipitation, especially as a new capacity of about 4 GW has to be installed each year. The intention of the authors is to present the German conditions that led to the current favorable situation for wind energy and to compare these to the Brazilian circumstances that exist for an extended application of this energy source. At the same time special attention is paid to the newest legal developments in Brazil. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, attention within the sustainability transitions literature has focused on the politics of deliberately accelerating sustainability transitions. One core strand of this research has been to understand the role of coalition-building in supporting or undermining decarbonisation efforts. This scholarly work has clear synergies with the on-the-ground environmental justice movement, yet to date there has been limited exchange between this new literature and environmental justice movements. This perspective paper addresses this gap through examining three core areas of important and meaningful overlap between the environmental justice movement and the scholarly literature. These synergies centre around the praxis of building coalitions, understandings of power and appreciation of justice. In the context of climate breakdown, and the need to accelerate transitions to more just and sustainable futures, this perspective paper aims to lay the groundwork for more meaningful ex-change between the scholarly literature and on-the-ground environmental movement.

AB  - Interannual rainfall variations in equatorial East Africa are tightly linked to the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), with more rain and flooding during El Nino and droughts in La Nina years, both having severe impacts on human habitation and food security. Here we report evidence from an annually laminated lake sediment record from southeastern Kenya for interannual to centennial-scale changes in ENSO-related rainfall variability during the last three millennia and for reductions in both the mean rate and the variability of rainfall in East Africa during the Last Glacial period. Climate model simulations support forward extrapolation from these lake sediment data that future warming will intensify the interannual variability of East Africa's rainfall.

AB  - In this article, we argue that the effort to get the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda implemented in a series of bureaucratic institutions has pulled the agenda quite far from its original motivating intent. Indeed, going down the bureaucratic implementation rabbit hole has made it almost impossible for advocates to stay in touch with the foundational WPS question: how do you get to gender-just sustainable peace? As we approach the twentieth anniversary of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, we argue that WPS advocates need to return to that question, but in doing so, must also acknowledge the changed context. One striking change is that climate breakdown is both more acute and more apparent than in 2000, and any attempt to build gender-just sustainable peace will face serious climate-induced challenges. However, the climate crisis creates not only challenges for the WPS agenda, but also opportunities. The sustainability of peace and of the planet are inextricably linked, and we argue that the realization of the WPS agenda requires transformations to social, political, and, most importantly, economic structures that are precisely the same as the transformations needed to ward off greater climate catastrophe.

AB  - MotivationMale gatekeeping and biased social norms in difficult settings characterized by fragility, authoritarianism, and conflict create challenges for women's political participation. This article explores the nature of challenges experienced by women and how they exercise political agency in such settings-as voters, claimants, and brokers of services, and as activists. PurposeI investigate the range of expressions of women's political agency and responses they secure from public authorities in difficult settings. I ask the question: how and to what effect do women exercise political agency in difficult settings? Analysis of the range of expressions of political agency allows a broader view of women's engagement in politics. Methods and approachThe article develops a framework to identify the range of expressions of women's individual and collective agency from Action for Empowerment and Accountability (A4EA) studies conducted in Egypt, Mozambique, Nigeria, and Pakistan. This synthesis explores social norms and male gatekeeping; strategies women use to navigate these and limit backlash; and the changes that result from women taking action. FindingsEvidence shows that social norms and male gatekeeping limit women's engagement in politics and their relations with multiple public authorities that operate in difficult settings. Women use gender-specific repertoires to organize protests and make claims on authorities and specific strategies to reduce the risk of backlash from their own communities and security agencies. The findings show that, while there is some success in claim-making on specific issues and that at a personal level women feel more empowered, these do not necessarily lead to systemic change. Policy implicationsDonors and local authorities need to develop interventions that tackle male gatekeeping within political parties and communities to facilitate women's political engagement. Flexibility in funding will enable donors to work directly or indirectly with grassroots and national women's rights groups in difficult settings for developing contextualized, bottom-up interventions. Strengthening pro-gender-equality alliances and spaces for deliberation will help to ensure that gender equality is not co-opted by authoritarian leaders and populist groups and will sustain counter-narratives.

AB  - This paper explores the work-lives of middle class Muslim professionals in India's new service economy. While these workers have successfully negotiated labour market entry into the core' growth sectors of India's globalising economy, they are simultaneously subject to different forms of social, cultural and political marginalisation. Strikingly, they also remain at the margins of both economic geography and development geography scholarship. The paper extends a growing development geography/economic geography intellectual trading zone' and enhances understandings of the complex relationships between labour agency, marginality and social inclusion. The paper draws on new survey data to document patterns of labour agency amongst Muslim professionals in New Delhi. This is augmented by interviews with Muslim professionals to show how different forms of marginality are experienced in their everyday work-lives and the strategies and agencies articulated towards (re)working those marginalities. The paper concludes by reflecting on the broader implications of these findings in relation to socially inclusive growth, the middle-class transformation of India's Muslims and wider understandings of marginality and worker agency.

AB  - Forest ecosystems are increasingly subject to disturbances, such as extreme (climate) events, fires and pathological outbreaks, which exert significant (and still poorly quantified) economic impacts, despite their intrinsic resilience. How forest management addresses these challenges will have profound effects on human health, environmental diversity, (ecological and economic) productivity and the ability of forest ecosystems to recovery from exogenous shocks. Assuming forests as ensuring ecosystem services that are vital to society and human well-being, in addition to providing wood material, a better knowledge of forest ecosystems appears a key requirement to delineate a developmental strategy that guarantees environmental protection objectives and achievement of climate and energy targets. In the context of Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda, the information available on forest management practices in Europe still seems not completely suitable to provide a comprehensive overview of ecosystem conditions, their economic value, and their biodiversity. Based on a literature review, the present contribution focuses on recent dynamics of the forestry sector in Europe, delineating the inherent complexity in the environmental-economic nexus. Additionally, the extensive use of a key natural resource such as wood exerts social implications for local districts adapting to ecological change-from climate warming to landscape transformations. In line with earlier studies, our paper confirms the role of the technical-economic dimension of forestry in sustainable development paths of districts and regions, affecting together (i) short-term economic dynamics, (ii) the growth prospects of the sector, (iii) the organization of the supply chain, (iv) the interconnections between companies, and (v) investment strategies at large. One of the major issues is the low reliability of official statistics to provide a coherent picture of the actual status of forest resources. At the same time, forestry practices are pivotal in maintaining habitats and species while increasing the timber production that remains (too) sustainable. This is the policy direction constantly given by the European Commission to stimulate over time public bodies and private (in whose hands is about 60% of European forests) to start virtuous paths in the circular economy with considerable repercussions in terms of additional jobs, recycled materials, mt of CO2 equivalent avoided, and increase in community added value. In this context, forestry should assure a more 'holistic' contribution to sustainable development paths at various spatial scales. This means concentrating on both economic and environmental targets based on the identification of significant (ecological-economic) dimensions that may delineate future lines of investigation and policy intervention, while increasing between member countries and regional authorities.

AB  - This paper argues that Environmental Labour Studies may benefit from incorporating the perspective of environmental justice. We offer a theorization of working-class ecology as the place where working-class communities live and work, being typically affected by environmental injustice, and of working-class environmentalism as those forms of activism that link labour and environmental struggles around the primacy of reproduction. The paper's theoretical section draws on a social ethnography of working-class ecology in the case of Taranto, a mono-industrial town in southern Italy, which is experiencing a severe environmental and public-health crisis. We show how environmental justice activism since the early 2000s has allowed the re-framing of union politics along new ways of politicizing the local economy. We conclude by offering a conceptual topology of working-class ecology, which situates different labour organizations (confederal, social/community, and rank-and-file unions) according to their positioning in respect to environmental justice.

AB  - Land use changes in the tropics under the pressure of population growth have attracted wide attention. In this study, the riparian area with more settlements was selected to explore the land use temporal-spatial characteristics of the less developed Lake Tanganyika region. The study methods employed mainly included land use transition matrix, kernel density estimation, grid and buffer analysis of the ArcGIS software and remote sensing image processing. The changes of land use mainly reflected in the transformation between different land types, among which the conversion from forestland into arable land constituted the major event. Though the land use change rate was not so significant for the whole region, dramatic changes occurred around the towns especially in the northern area. It was found that a circle of arable land of about 6 km in width and more than 40% arable land density composed the farming hinterland of the major towns. Moreover, with the forest transition theory the change trends of land use and their influencing factors were analysed. The findings in this study should be helpful for the land use simulation and planning in similar riparian areas. For better understanding the dynamic of land use change, a future additional in-depth study at extensive spatial and temporal scale is appealed.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) constitutes a critical component of carbon reservoirs within terrestrial ecosystems. The ramifications of urban land use transitions on SOC dynamics, particularly in rapidly urbanizing regions such as Shanghai, remain insufficiently elucidated. This investigation synergizes a predictive land use change model (Logistic-CA-Markov) with an ecosystem service quantification framework (InVEST), aiming to delineate the interplay between SOC variability and Land Use and Land Cover Change (LUCC) under natural development and ecological protection scenarios. Empirical observations from 2010 to 2020 reveal a contraction in Shanghai's agricultural land of 34,912.76 hectares, juxtaposed with an expansion of urban built-up areas of 36,048.24 hectares. Projections for 2030 under an ecological protection scenario indicate a moderated urban sprawl, reducing built-up area expansion by 13,518 hectares relative to the natural development scenario. Notably, the net carbon sequestration capacity of Shanghai is anticipated to diminish by approximately 0.418 million tons between 2020 and 2030. This trend is observed under both considered scenarios, forecasting a cumulative reduction in SOC stocks exceeding 1 million tons by 2030. The natural development pathway portends a more pronounced and accelerated depletion of SOC reserves. Although ecological conservation measures show the potential to decelerate this loss, they appear insufficient to reverse the ongoing decline in SOC stocks. This study advocates for strategic urban planning interventions focused on constraining the growth of building densities and augmenting the preservation and management of eco-lands. Such measures are imperative for bolstering Shanghai's carbon sequestration capacity.

AB  - The advent of civilization has made humans dependent on plants for food and medicine, leading to the intensification of agricultural production. The intense cultivation of crops has resulted in the depletion of available nutrients from soil, thereby demanding the application of excess nutrients to soil to improve yield. Thus, mineral fertilizer discovery and application have, in many ways, contributed greatly to meeting global food demands. However, aside from the positive effects of mineral fertilizers, their excessive application to soil produces large amounts of pollutants that affect environmental sustainability. This necessitates the study of the major mineral fertilizer elements (nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K)), the forms in which they are applied to soil, and their chemistry/reactions in soil. Here, we reviewed the forms of different N, P, and K mineral fertilizers to provide current knowledge on their constituents, the chemistry of N, P, and K in soil to understand the reactions they undertake in soil, the efficient methods of fertilizer application for environmental sustainability, the effects of mineral fertilizer loss to the environment, and improved fertilization technologies for environmental sustainability. Nanofertilizers are a promising technology for sustainable agricultural production and are discussed in detail in this review.

AB  - Intermittently aerated activated sludge processes save energy by minimizing the total aeration time per day without deteriorating effluent water quality. Swine wastewater contains high, often widely fluctuating concentrations of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and nitrogen. BOD-based aeration control would therefore be a useful method to reduce the energy demands of aeration, but requires a reliable BOD sensor for swine wastewater. In this study we developed a novel approach for BOD- and pH-based intermittent aeration control (BAC) using a BOD biosensor based on exoelectrogenic bacteria and tested it at four swine wastewater treatment plants. This BAC system reduced aeration energy in the plants by 15-36% compared to fixed aeration cycle operations while maintaining low concentrations of BOD and total nitrogen in the effluent. The energy saved per wastewater volume was 477-1012 kWh/m(3)/yr, equivalent to a reduction of 2.2-7.0 t-CO2/m(3)/yr in greenhouse gas emissions. The biosensor was equipped with an internet connection to allow for remote monitoring of water quality data with a smartphone, saving labour in the operational management of the plants. Aquabacterium and the aerobic denitrifier Thauera were detected as the predominant genera in the activated sludge.

AB  - Digital soil mapping of soil organic matter (SOM) is necessary because of its importance for carbon sequestration, soil health, and food security. However, large-scale digital soil mapping of SOM remains a challenge to improve accuracy and provide more local information. To address this knowledge gap, a strategy that incorporates remote and proximal sensing data into an ensemble model for the digital soil mapping is proposed. In this study, moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer, portable X-ray fluorescence, and visible near-infrared spectroscopy data from 402 soil samples were used to map the SOM at a resolution of 90 m, model the SOM with random forest, cubist, and ensemble models, and evaluate its environmental factors in the northeastern and northern Chinese plains, a typical agricultural plain (approximately 66,000,000 ha). The digital maps of the SOM were derived along with their uncertainties. The results show that the visible near-infrared and portable X-ray fluorescence data play an important role in the SOM distribution. Inclusion of these data in the model, improved the R-p(2) by 6.25-35.42 %, and reduced the root mean square error of the prediction by 0.30-1.54 g kg(-1). The ensemble model, which included remote and proximal sensing variables, outperformed the results of previous studies with a root mean square error of 6.68 g kg 1 and provided more detailed information. Thus, this study confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The SOM product obtained by this strategy was able to accurately control soil management, and the structural equation model showed that human activities exerted a direct influence on SOM comparable to the overall effect of natural factors on SOM. The contribution of straw mulching to human activities was great with path coefficient >0.50. This suggests that land management, especially straw mulching, should be improved in this area. In summary, this study proposed a novel strategy for accurately and efficiently obtaining SOM products for agricultural decision-making, terrestrial carbon cycling, and carbon stock estimation. Future advancements will focus on more accurate and detailed global SOM maps or carbon storage by integrating multiple models with remote sensing data and proximal sensing data from available soil spectral libraries.

AB  - The surge in energy consumption and CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions is exacerbating global warming. The Chinese government has promised to reduce CO2 emission by 60%-65% per unit of GDP over the 2005 level by around 2030. Analyzing the factors influencing CO2 emissions is one of the key aspects involved in effectively reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper, we add climatic factors based on socio-economic factors, and adopt the extended STIRPAT model to investigate the mechanism driving emissions by the co-action of natural and socio-economic factors. The results show that the 1995-2014 emissions in China's Zhejiang province had an upward trend with growth rates varying between intermediate periods. The order of the factors' elasticity coefficients is urbanization rate (0.181) > GDP per capita (0.180) > population (0.177) > energy intensity (0.170) > trade openness (0.170) > cooling degree days (0.127) > mean temperature anomaly (0.116). Economic development and urbanization were the main factors promoting CO2 emissions in 1996-1999, while economic development and foreign trade were the main factors in 2000-2014. Policy makers should pay more attention to keeping a healthy pace of economic development, introducing more low energy consumption and low pollution enterprises and encouraging technological innovation. Improving the quality of urbanization, guiding a sustainable lifestyle, adjusting the structure of foreign trade and curbing energy intensity are also expected to reduce emissions.

AB  - Understanding the complex relationship between ecosystem services and human well-being during the rapid development of urban agglomerations can promote the sustainable development of urban agglomerations. In this paper, the InVEST model and ArcGIS10.2 were used to analyze the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of ecosystem services and human well-being in the Guanzhong Plain urban agglomeration. On this basis, the coupling coordination index is used to reveal the spatiotemporal coupling relationship between them. (1) From 2010 to 2018, the water conservation services, soil conservation services, and carbon sequestration services of the Guanzhong Plain urban agglomeration showed a fluctuating downward trend. The spatial differences of ecosystem services were significant. (2) From 2010 to 2018, human well-being in the Guanzhong Plain urban agglomeration showed a fluctuating downward trend, with a decrease of 17%, and regional differences tended to narrow. (3) The coupling coordination degree between ecosystem services and human well-being has slightly decreased while maintaining the basic coordination state. The results show that there was a significant relationship between the decline of ecosystem services and the rapid development of the Guanzhong Plain urban agglomeration, and policies should be classified according to the coupling coordination types of human well-being and ecosystem services to promote the sustainable development of urban agglomerations.

AB  - Achieving a balance between economic growth, environmental sustainability, and social well-being remains a pressing challenge for emerging economies. This study examines the factors contributing to inclusive growth in the BRICS countries, concentrating on the connections between life expectancy, environmental sustainability, and economic growth. We perform wavelet-based data analysis from 1990 to 2022 to investigate the dynamic time-frequency relationships between life expectancy (LEO) and essential variables such as GDP, CO2 emissions, RNE consumption, and population growth (PGP). The results show that although economic development and industrialization often increase life expectancy, they also hurt the environment, as most BRICS countries have a positive link between CO2 emissions and life expectancy at birth. The findings also indicate that short-term economic and infrastructural disturbances prevent the immediate effects of renewable energy usage on life expectancy. Furthermore, because population increases burden healthcare systems and resources, inclusive growth faces substantial hurdles. The study provides insights into the importance of green energy and demographic management in fostering sustainable and inclusive growth, and it underscores the challenges of striking a balance between economic development, social well-being, and environmental sustainability in emerging nations.

AB  - As the global economy develops and the population increases, greenhouse gas emissions and wastewater discharge have become inevitable global problems. Conventional wastewater treatment processes produce direct or indirect greenhouse gas, which can intensify global warming. Microalgae-based wastewater treatment technology can not only purify wastewater and use the nutrients in wastewater to produce microalgae biomass, but it can also absorb CO2 in the atmosphere or flue gas through photosynthesis, which demonstrates great potential as a sustainable and economical wastewater treatment technology. This review highlights the multifaceted roles of microalgae in different types of wastewater treatment processes in terms of the extent of their bioremediation function and microalgae biomass production. In addition, various newly developed microalgae cultivation systems, especially biofilm cultivation systems, were further characterized systematically. The performance of different microalgae cultivation systems was studied and summarized. Current research on the technical approaches for the modification of the CO2 capture by microalgae and the maximization of CO2 transfer and conversion efficiency were also reviewed. This review serves as a useful and informative reference for the application of wastewater treatment and CO2 capture by microalgae, aiming to provide a reference for the realization of carbon neutrality in wastewater treatment systems.

AB  - Soil erosion, one of the most serious phenomena in watershed management, can be estimated based on various criteria. Land use change is one of the most important factors affecting the susceptibility of soil erosion. In this study, the effect of land use change on soil erosion risk in two plan periods (2005 and 2017) was investigated using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for the forest planning units in the Do & gbreve;anc & imath; Dam Watershed, located in Bursa, T & uuml;rkiye. Eight criteria were evaluated including erosion-related slope, bedrock type, land use/land cover, precipitation, relative relief, aspect, drainage frequency, and density. According to the results, the most effective factor in soil erosion was slope (0.29), while bedrock type and land use/land cover ranked second with 0.19. It was found that full closure forests were characterized by high erosion resistance (0.3), while bare land was characterized as the most sensitive area to erosion (0.39). In terms of spatio-temporal changes in a 12-year period, the areas in the medium and high erosion risk decreased, while low and very low-risk areas increased. The ROC method showed a satisfactory accuracy of 72.8% and 80.2% for the 2005 and 2017 erosion risk maps, respectively.

AB  - Merging traditional intensive forestry with waste management offers dual goals of fiber and bioenergy production, along with environmental benefits such as soil/water remediation and carbon sequestration. As part of an ongoing effort to acquire data about initial genotypic performance, we evaluated: (1) the early aboveground growth of trees belonging to currently utilized Populus genotypes subjected to irrigation with municipal solid waste landfill leachate or non-fertilized well water (control), and (2) the above- and below-ground biomass of the trees after 70 days of growth. We determined height, diameter, and number of leaves at 28, 42, 56, and 70 days after planting (DAP), along with stem, leaf, and root dry mass by testing six Populus clones (DN34, DN5, 14551, NC14104, NM2, NM6) grown in a greenhouse in a split-split plot, repeated measures design with two blocks, two treatments (whole-plots), six clones (sub-plots), and four sampling dates (sub-sub-plots, repeated measure). Treatments (leachate, water) were applied every other day beginning 42 DAP. The leachate-treated trees exhibited greater height, diameter, and number of leaves at 56 and 70 DAP (P<0.05). There was broad variation in clonal responses to leachate treatment for dry mass, with a general trend of leachate-treated trees exhibiting greater stem and leaf dry mass (P<0.05), but negligible differences for root dry mass (P>0.05). Overall, genotypic responses to the leachate treatment were clone-specific for all traits. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Properly structured vehicle mileage fee systems may help transportation professionals and officials at all levels address prominent issues such as funding gaps, traffic congestion, and emissions. In theory, vehicles should be assessed a user fee equivalent to the full marginal cost not borne by users. The full marginal cost of auto and truck travel in different time periods on all roadways in Maryland was estimated. The study evaluated the impacts of such marginal-cost vehicle miles traveled ('VMT) fees on travel behavior, revenue generation, equity, pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions in Maryland and the surrounding states of Delaware, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Results showed that with consideration of all driving externalities, the marginal-cost VMT fee for travel in Maryland during peak periods ranged from 0.20 to about 12.16 cents/mi and from 3.91 to about 45.33 cents/mi for cars and trucks, respectively. Compared with existing revenue policy, the marginal-cost VMT fee could reduce overall VMT by 7.65% in the multistate region covered by the quantitafive model and by 7.81% just in Maryland. Also, air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in Maryland could be reduced by 7.62% to 9.42% by pollutant type. Total revenue generation would increase by about 168% (including fuel taxes and bridge and roadway tolls). In regard to income equity, the middle-income group would be hurt most (largest consumer surplus decrease), while the highest-income group would be hurt least. Results also indicated that the proposed marginal-cost VMT fee in Maryland could affect neighboring states to varying degrees.

AB  - Environmental issues are viewed as a serious problem with a complex network structure involving various stakeholders. Environmental governance is considered the most reasonable way to promote environmental policy, and it is an important mechanism contributing to the sustainable development of society. Through the network analysis of actor and policy keywords, this study demonstrated whether environmental governance policies are being pursued through the cooperation of various participants in China, the epicenter of global environmental issues. We collected text big data from 2001 to 2018 under the theme of environmental policy on the main online portal web in China. Through text mining, key actors and policy keywords were selected according to the timing of environmental policy promotion, and network analysis and core-periphery analysis were conducted based on this actor/keywords data set. The results of this study are as follows. First, China's environmental policy is a rudimentary governance cooperation structure, and the central and local governments are still the main policy-promoting actors. Second, the fundamental solution of the environmental problem through readjustment of the environment-related system and industrial restructuring has become the keyword for China's implementation of environmental policy at present. Third, there were certain words, such as social, public, enterprise, and institution, in the aspects of environmental governance, while these words failed to be at the center of multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) analysis for the actors. This result shows that environmental governance and network are still at an early stage and that the Chinese government's strong power lies in its environmental policy. Based on these results, policy recommendations are presented.

AB  - The Convention on Biological Diversity's Aichi Targets address both biodiversity and ecosystem services. We explore the relationship between giant panda populations and three ecosystem services: carbon sequestration, water retention, and soil retention. Do pandas prefer areas with higher than average values of these services? Areas may be good for pandas but not for these ecosystem services, and vice versa. Answering these questions can focus panda conservation. We map their spatial distribution and temporal changes from 2000 to 2015, by watershed, to target future protected areas for both pandas and these ecosystem services. Pandas occupy watersheds with above-average carbon sequestration and water retention. There is no tendency for pandas to be increasing in watersheds that have higher than average values of these ecosystem services or in watersheds where they are improving. Protected areas represented watersheds with higher than average values of these ecosystem services but without pandas only poorly. Watersheds with pandas do provide higher than average ecosystem services, but watersheds above average for these ecosystem services often lack pandas. Those areas might be potentially important for pandas, but obstacles block their way. We identified conservation areas combining habitats, population, activity range, and higher than average values of these ecosystem services and then proposed new protected areas.

AB  - In today's socio-economic context where environmental protection and sustainable development are equally important, how renewable energy enterprises can achieve sustainable development has become a topic of academic interest in recent years. This paper investigates the link between sustainable growth (SG) of renewable energy firms, resource endowment (RE), and environmental regulatory (ERs) issues through a fixed-effects model and a GMM model. Through empirical analysis, it was found that economical environmental regulations have the greatest positive impact on sustainable growth, followed by legal environmental regulations and supervised environmental regulations. Resource endowment is positively related to sustainable growth for non-state-owned renewable energy enterprises, but the negative impact on sustainable growth reflects the effect the of "resource curse". In addition, resource endowment has a negative moderating effect on environmental regulations and sustainable growth. Thus, the most significant effect is on the relationship between economical environmental regulations and sustainable growth, followed by legal environmental regulations and supervised environmental regulations. Therefore, the flexible and concurrent application of multiple environmental policies is an important way to ensure effective regulations and promote sustainable business growth.

AB  - The growing interest in the Management of Eco-Friendly Supply Chains warrants this study. Green supply chain management (GSCM) is an approach to supply chain management (SCM) that takes into account environmental factors. Therefore, GSCM is vital in shaping the cumulative environmental effect of businesses engaged in supply chain operations. In addition, GSCM may help improve the effectiveness of sustainability initiatives. Manufacturing companies, particularly in developing nations like India, are trying to adjust essential procedures and supply chains because of the rising need to be ecologically sustainable. However, such efforts must be deployed strategically to be ecologically sustainable and economically successful. As a result, this study focuses on the relationship between green supply chain management and education that affect environmental sustainability and economic performance. As a further step toward more sustainable development, the mediating function of education is sustainable economic growth and environmental health. The data was collected by distributing a well-crafted questionnaire to manufacturing facilities in India. We employed PLS-SEM to analyze and interpret the data test hypotheses based on data from 415 replies. The findings point to cost and profit as the primary metrics of corporate success. Disposal of trash, usage of resources, and release of greenhouse gases are alternative measures of environmental sustainability. Distributed online links and in-person interviews with employees at companies throughout India who use GSCM procedures provided the basis for the study's primary data set. The data was gathered with the use of an organized survey form. The findings of tests conducted on the hypotheses were considered. According to this research, cost, profit, waste, resource, and GHG emission impacts vary depending on which GSCM techniques are implemented. Green supply chain management strategies significantly affect price, trash disposal, resource utilization, and GHG emissions. There was no discernible trend between GSCM methods and financial success. In addition to discussing the unique elements of sustainable supply chains and the limits of current research, this article also discusses how a company's bottom line will benefit monetarily from establishing a sustainable supply chain. This should inspire more study in this area. Our investigation revealed patterns and voids, and we used that information to outline a thorough plan for future GSCM studies. The research helps manufacturing company management improve their sustainable policies while providing policymakers with pointers.

AB  - Soil thermal conductivity (lambda) is frequently required when studying coupled heat and water transfer in soils. While lambda models are widely available for mineral soil, they are not as readily available for organic soil, which plays an increasingly significant role in climate change and carbon sequestration. This study used a heat-pulse method to measure the thermal properties of six soil peat:mineral mixes spanning wide ranges of water contents and bulk densities. Based on this, a new generalized lambda model was proposed, which was tested by fitting the model to heat-pulse measurements, and then comparing with several other widely-used empirical or physically-based models of lambda. The new model accounts for the effects of porosity, degree of saturation, organic matter content and soil texture on the thermal conductivity. It is capable of describing the measured data more effectively than other models due to its simplicity and applicability, as indicated by the lowest values of root mean square error (0.028 W m(-1) K-1) and the highest value of Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (0.995). The new model has shown potential for use in studying numerical algorithms for describing coupled heat and mass transfer processes in a variety of multiphase soils. It can also be incorporated into global land surface models, particularly in terms of identifying the significance of peat soils on climate change and carbon sequestration.

AB  - Background: Adequate staffing of primary healthcare workers (PHCWs) is essential for strengthening healthcare systems, yet high turnover intention among these workers presents a significant challenge. While existing strategies primarily target economic incentives and career progression, this study proposes that enhancing organizational justice could offer a novel and impactful approach to retention. Drawing on equity theory and self-determination theory, the study examines how organizational justice influences turnover intention and the mediating roles of both the intensity and type of work motivation. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study design. A multi-stage cluster sampling method was utilized to administer a questionnaire survey to 1,200 PHCWs from 36 primary health institutions in Shandong Province, China. Results: Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that organizational justice significantly reduces turnover intention among PHCWs ((3 = -0.435, p < 0.001). Among its three dimensions, distributive justice ((3 = -0.203, p < 0.001) and procedural justice ((3 = -0.177, p < 0.01) had significant impacts on turnover intention, whereas interactional justice did not. The study also confirmed the mediating role of work motivation, with work motivation type accounting for 18.2% of the total effect, exerting a greater influence than work motivation intensity, which accounted for 13.8% of the total effect. Conclusion: This study finds that organizational justice, especially distributive and procedural justice, reduces turnover intention among PHCWs in China. Work motivation mediates this effect, with motivation type having a stronger influence than motivation intensity. Enhancing organizational justice through transparent systems for compensation, promotion, and inclusive decision-making can foster the internalization of work motivation, providing a sustainable approach to improving retention and supporting the stability of the primary healthcare workforce.

AB  - The imperative for effective climate governance has recently driven numerous countries to consider incorporating sustainability criteria within the framework of global trade governance. A noteworthy effort in this direction is the Trade and Environmental Sustainability Structured Discussions (TESSD) within the World Trade Organization (WTO). Regrettably, there has been a scarcity of studies thoroughly examining the intricacies of the TESSD negotiations. This article fills this literature gap by empirically analysing the ongoing TESSD negotiations. Moreover, the TESSD's plurilateral nature adds an extra layer of significance to its examination. While some scholars have theorized about the benefits of embracing plurilateralism in reforming WTO rules, none have yet subjected this hypothesis to empirical scrutiny. This article examines whether the plurilateral approach used in TESSD negotiations delivers these benefits. It reveals whether the TESSD negotiations can be likened to the ugly duckling's transformation into a graceful white swan, essentially deviating from the multilateral approach. Overall, this article's primary contribution lies in its critical examination of the TESSD negotiations and a thoughtful reflection on using the plurilateral negotiation approach in the context of environmental sustainability.

AB  - Microwave-assisted wet co-torrefaction of food sludge (FS) and six widely produced lignocellulose biowaste samples were performed for biochar production. Factors including the torrefaction temperature, reaction time, biowaste type, and blending ratio of sludge and biowaste were evaluated. Biochar produced from FS torrefied at 150 degrees C for 20 min exhibited the greatest enhancement of carbon content and higher heating value (HHV). Blending sludge with macadamia husk at a ratio of 25/75 (db%) under the same wet torrefaction condition further improved biochar quality, enhanced the fixed carbon content, caused the highest HHV (19.6 MJ/kg), and considerably decreased the ash content. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated that sludge and biowaste degradation followed first-order kinetics, and the resultant biochar exhibited improved thermal stability, combustion efficiency, and safety for biofuel applications because of the increase in the activation energy, frequency factor, and ignition and combustion temperatures. Biochar is an excellent coal substitute for power generation because of its enhanced energy efficiency (energy return on investment: 7.4) and environmental friendliness (45.2 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared with using bituminous coal). Moreover, the protein and carbohydrate contents in the supernatant of FS co-torrefied with biowaste at different blending ratios increased by 1.8-9.0 and 0.8-3.4, respectively. These contents can be recycled back to the activated sludge unit as a nutrient source, rendering the process green and sustainable without any waste production.

AB  - In responding to global ecosystem conservation and sustainable social development, numerous ecological restoration projects have been performed in ecologically vulnerable areas around the world, especially in semi-arid areas. Affected by local hydrothermal conditions, whether ecological restoration projects can achieve goals of balanced water-carbon enhancement as well as sustainable development in semi-arid areas is controversial. It is uncertain that to what extent the land use change caused by ecological restoration projects will affect the water-carbon imbalance. This research takes the Bashang Plateau Protection Zone (BPZ), a typical semi-arid area in Hebei Province of China, as a porotype to discover the spatial water-carbon changes and their contributing factors under ecological projects during 2000 to 2020 through root mean square deviation and random forest analysis. Results show: (1) In the past two decades, carbon sequestration in BPZ continued to improve while water conservation decreased significantly. The water-carbon imbalance regions in BPZ increased nearly 6.80 folds, from 338.60 km2 to 2642.38 km2. (2) Precipitation and temperature exerted the most significant impact on the formation of water-carbon imbalance regions, whereas the contribution of land use change could reach 40%, demonstrating that human activities were also strongly responsible for water-carbon imbalance. (3) Ecological restoration pattern of limiting afforestation and agricultural land expansion with priority restoration of grassland is beneficial to achieving water-carbon balance and sustainable goals of ecological restoration in semi-arid regions.

AB  - 1. Recent global trends of increasing woody plant abundance in grass-dominated ecosystems may substantially enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and could represent a strong carbon (C) sink in the terrestrial environment. However, few studies have quantitatively addressed the influence of spatial heterogeneity of vegetation and soil properties on SOC storage at the landscape scale. In addition, most studies assessing SOC response to woody encroachment consider only surface soils, and have not explicitly assessed the extent to which deeper portions of the soil profile may be sequestering C. 2. We quantified the direction, magnitude and pattern of spatial heterogeneity of SOC in the upper 1.2 m of the profile following woody encroachment via spatially specific intensive soil sampling across a landscape in a subtropical savanna in the Rio Grande Plains, USA, that has undergone woody proliferation during the past century. 3. Increased SOC accumulation following woody encroachment was observed to considerable depth, albeit at reduced magnitudes in deeper portions of the profile. Overall, woody clusters and groves accumulated 12.87 and 18.67 Mg Cha(-1) more SOC compared to grasslands to a depth of 1.2 m. 4. Woody encroachment significantly altered the pattern of spatial heterogeneity of SOC to a depth of 5 cm, with marginal effect at 5-15 cm, and no significant impact on soils below 15 cm. Fine root density explained greater variability of SOC in the upper 15 cm, while a combination of fine root density and soil clay content accounted for more of the variation in SOC in soils below 15 cm across this landscape. 5. Synthesis. Substantial soil organic carbon sequestration can occur in deeper portions of the soil profile following woody encroachment. Furthermore, vegetation patterns and soil properties influenced the spatial heterogeneity and uncertainty of soil organic carbon in this landscape, highlighting the need for spatially specific sampling that can characterize this variability and enable scaling and modelling. Given the geographic extent of woody encroachment on a global scale, this undocumented deep soil carbon sequestration suggests this vegetation change may play a more significant role in regional and global carbon sequestration than previously thought.

AB  - Monitoring and classifying disturbed forests can provide information support for not only sustainable forest management but also global carbon sequestration assessments. In this study, we propose an autoencoder-based model for forest disturbance detection, which considers disturbances as anomalous events in forest temporal trajectories. The autoencoder network is established and trained to reconstruct intact forest trajectories. Then, the disturbance detection threshold is derived by Tukey's method based on the reconstruction error of the intact forest trajectory. The assessment result shows that the model using the NBR time series performs better than the NDVI-based model, with an overall accuracy of 90.3%. The omission and commission errors of disturbed forest are 7% and 12%, respectively. Additionally, the trained NBR-based model is implemented in two test areas, with overall accuracies of 87.2% and 86.1%, indicating the robustness and scalability of the model. Moreover, comparing three common methods, the proposed model performs better, especially for intact forest detection accuracy. This study provides a novel and robust approach with acceptable accuracy for forest disturbance detection, enabling forest disturbance to be identified in regions with limited disturbance reference data.

AB  - To accurately ascertain the behavior of oxidation heating and emission of oxidation products in fully enclosed coal storage yards under the influence of natural convection, comprehensive adiabatic oxidation experiments were conducted, encompassing coal particles of multiple grain sizes. Linear regression analysis was applied to deduce the heating characteristics of coal particles within real coal stockpiles from the experimental data. Subsequently, numerical simulations were executed, leveraging the acquired oxidation parameters specific to the stored coal. These simulations unveiled that natural convection triggers the formation of spiral airflow on both sides of the stockpile, with the strength of this airflow increasing in tandem with rising temperatures. An inflection point becomes evident during the impact assessment of porosity on maximum temperature variation, whereby its augmentation improves the heating rate when below the critical threshold, but conversely diminishes it when surpassing that threshold. Furthermore, coal particles smaller than 3 mm effectively isolate oxygen. As the degree of metamorphism increases, the rate of temperature rise decreases, and the high -temperature region penetrates deeper into the coal stockpile. The genetic algorithm-optimized random forest algorithm emerges as a highly effective tool for the precise prediction of the efficient storage duration of the coal stockpile. Keeping porosity below 0.25 proves effective in oxygen isolation. Lower heights and steeper slope angles exhibit the capacity to decelerate oxidation during high-temperature phases, thereby minimizing the loss of coal calorific value and greenhouse gas emissions. This study is paramount for the achievement of secure, efficient, and environmentally friendly coal storage practices in the context of natural convection.

AB  - Salinization is a major soil degradation process threatening ecosystems and posing a great challenge to sustainable agriculture and food security worldwide. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms in soil salinity (EC1:5) mapping. Further, we predicted the distribution patterns of soil salinity under different future scenarios in the Yellow River Delta. A geodatabase comprising 201 soil samples and 19 conditioning factors (containing data based on remote sensing images such as Landsat, SPOT/VEGETATION PROBA-V, SRTMDEMUTM, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2) was used to compare the predictive performance of empirical bayesian kriging regression, random forest, and CatBoost models. The CatBoost model exhibited the highest performance with both training and testing datasets, with an average MAE of 1.86, an average RMSE of 3.11, and an average R2 of 0.59 in the testing datasets. Among explanatory factors, soil Na was the most important for predicting EC1:5, followed by the normalized difference vegetation index and soil organic carbon. Soil EC(1:5 )predictions suggested that the Yellow River Delta region faces severe salinization, particularly in coastal zones. Among three scenarios with increases in soil organic carbon content (1, 2, and 3 g/kg), the 2 g/kg scenario resulted in the best improvement effect on saline-alkali soils with EC1:5 > 2 ds/m. Our results provide valuable insights for policymakers to improve saline-alkali land quality and plan regional agricultural development.

AB  - The aim of this study was to explore the multiple roles of public art in urban renewal and sustainable development goals, combining qualitative and quantitative methods, with an emphasis on community engagement and the application of theoretical frameworks. Through a detailed analysis of public art projects in Teruel, Spain, and Chengdu, China, this study shows how public art plays an important role in enhancing cultural values, promoting social inclusion, and driving economic growth. Qualitative methods such as interviews and content analysis were used to gain in-depth insights into the views and experiences of artists, urban planners, policymakers, and community members. At the same time, quantitative methods such as questionnaires and spatial analysis were used to assess the specific impacts of public art on urban beautification, social inclusion, and economic growth.
