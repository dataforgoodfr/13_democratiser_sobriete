AB  - Conservation practice has sometimes been criticized for relying on simplistic assumptions about social contexts in natural resource management. Despite recent advances conceptualizing the interface between human well-being and the environment, very few studies moving from theory to practice exist. We address this gap by providing one of the first careful examinations of local conceptualizations of well-being in a conservation context, using mixed methods to examine the multidimensionality and heterogeneity of well-being conceptualizations across three sites in northern Cambodia. Each site faced different levels of conservation activities and development pressures, the latter being mainly linked to the degree of impact from economic land concessions. Our results highlight village context as a key line of variation in individual well-being, rather than differences related to age, gender, or wealth. Our results suggest that conservation incentives that mirror people's aspirations can balance out negative trade-offs linked to compliance and can contribute to well-being. We show that multifaceted values are attached to well-being components, highlighting the importance of subjective indicators and perceptions to capture fully the social changes and impacts of conservation in complex contexts. We conclude that enquiries into subjective well-being should become an integral part of participatory assessments and adaptive management of conservation interventions.

AB  - Temperate grasslands account for c. 20% of the land area in Europe. Carbon accumulation in grassland ecosystems occurs mostly below ground and changes in soil organic carbon stocks may result from land use changes (e.g. conversion of arable land to grassland) and grassland management. Grasslands also contribute to the biosphere-atmosphere exchange of non-CO2 radiatively active trace gases, with fluxes intimately linked to management practices. In this article, we discuss the current knowledge on carbon cycling and carbon sequestration opportunities in temperate grasslands. First, from a simple two-parameter exponential model fitted to literature data, we assess soil organic carbon fluxes resulting from land use change (e.g. between arable and grassland) and from grassland management. Second, we discuss carbon fluxes within the context of farming systems, including crop-grass rotations and farm manure applications. Third, using a grassland ecosystem model (PaSim), we provide estimates of the greenhouse gas balance, in CO2 equivalents, of pastures for a range of stocking rates and of N fertilizer applications. Finally, we consider carbon sequestration opportunities for France resulting from the restoration of grasslands and from the deintensification of intensive livestock breeding systems. We emphasize major uncertainties concerning the magnitude and non-linearity of soil carbon stock changes in agricultural grasslands as well as the emissions of N2O from soil and of CH4 from grazing livestock.

AB  - This review explores the significance of nano fertilizers in addressing the concerns associated with the indiscriminate application of chemical fertilizers in agricultural soil. It focuses on the need for crop and soil-specific fertilizer application to prevent nitrogen overuse and proposes nanomaterials as a viable solution for amending soil with plant nutrients. The review examines the potential of nanomaterials for soil nutrient enhancement and discusses the different techniques involved in synthesizing nanofertilizers. It emphasizes the importance of studying both macronutrients and micronutrients concerning plants and explores the effectiveness of applying nanoparticles through roots or leaf surfaces regarding plant absorption rates. The review highlights that nano fertilizers have effectively raised crop yields by providing the ideal and necessary nutrients. It discusses how nano fertilizers can alleviate the heavy burden of chemical fertilizers, reduce associated costs, and promote sustainable agriculture. In conclusion, the review suggests that nano fertilizers offer a promising alternative to traditional chemical fertilizers. Farmers can mitigate the negative impacts of excessive nitrogen use while boosting crop yields by applying nano fertilizers in a targeted and soil-specific manner. The findings indicate that nano fertilizers, created through various synthesis techniques, can contribute to sustainable agriculture by providing adequate plant nutrients and reducing the reliance on chemical fertilizers.

AB  - The impacts of biochar addition with nitrogen fertilizer (Urea-N) on greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes and grain yields are not comprehensively understood. Therefore, we designed a field experiment in an intensive rice-wheat cropping system located in the Taihu Lake region of China and measured CH4 and N2O emissions for 2 consecutive years to examine the impacts of biochar combined with N-fertilizer on rice production and GHG flux. Three field experimental treatments were designed: (1) no N-fertilizer application (N0); (2) 270 kg N ha(-1) application (N270); and (3) 270 kg N-fertilizer ha(-1) plus 25 t ha(-1) biochar application (N270 + C). We found that, compared with urea application alone, biochar applied with Urea-N fertilizer increased N use efficiency (NUE) and resulted in more stable growth of rice yield. In addition, biochar addition increased CH4 emissions by 0.5-37.5% on average during the two consecutive rice-growing seasons, and decreased N2O-N loss by similar to 16.7%. During the first growing season, biochar addition did not significantly affect the global warming potential (GWPt) or the greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) of rice production (p > 0.05). By contrast, during the second rice-growing season, biochar application significantly increased GWPt and GHGI by 28.9% and 18.8%, respectively, mainly because of increased CH4 emissions. Our results suggest that biochar amendment could improve grain yields and NUE, and increased soil GWPt, resulting in a higher potential environmental cost, but that biochar additions enhance exogenous carbon sequestration by the soil, which could offset the increases in GHG emissions.

AB  - To mitigate global warming and the greenhouse effect, biochar (BC) has been regarded as an important way of carbon sink. Therefore, this research explored the development trend of BC for soil carbon sequestration and mitigation from 2001 to 2020 based on bibliometric analysis. The results show that Yong Sik Ok and Johannes Lehmann are the top 2 high-impact authors. China, America, and Germany are the most widely collaborated countries, but China's research impact is lower than that of America. The Chinese Academy of Sciences has far more publications than any other institution, but Cornell University and Kangwon National University lead the way in terms of impact. Research hotspots can be divided into five clusters: (1) pyrolysis, nutrient, and microbial communities; (2) the immobilization of heavy metals; (3) crop yield and soil properties; (4) greenhouse gas, meta-analysis, and field experiment; (5) carbon fraction and sequestration. Reviews account for 60 % of the top 10 most highly cited papers, and eight of the top 10 focus on the early research period, setting the stage for the development of the BC field. Science of the Total Environment has the highest number of publications and total citations, and literature published in Soil Biology and Biochemistry is to some extent more likely to be cited. In the future, we need to carry out research in the following aspects: (1) Interaction mechanisms between BC, soil, and soil microbial communities. (2) Designing low-cost, high-yield, and high-effect optimization methods to improve the characteristics of BC. (3) Effect of BC on the environment and human health in long-term locali-zation experiments. (4) Carbon sinks of BC need to be further evaluated on a global scale.

AB  - More than half of adults in the European Union (EU) are now either overweight or obese (53%). Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), many of which are diet-related, account for 70% of mortality in Europe and a growing share of healthcare costs. While eating habits have an important role to play in NCD prevention, consumption patterns across the EU are diverging significantly from recommended diets. There is growing consensus on the solution: a series of coordinated and wide-ranging policy interventions to build healthy 'food environments'. This article argues that EU governance structures remain ill-adapted to the systemic nature of this and other challenges in food systems (e.g. climate change, biodiversity loss, food poverty): conflicting objectives and missed synergies are identified between different policy areas (agriculture, trade, health, environment, etc.) and between different levels of governance (EU, national, local). An integrated food policy framework - a 'Common Food Policy' - is therefore required to meet the EU's public health and sustainability objectives. It identifies four distinct aspects of the governance shift required to promote healthy diets and build sustainable food systems in Europe: (i) coherence across policy areas; (ii) coherence across governance levels; (iii) governance for transition; and (iv) food democracy. Blueprints for a Common Food Policy are already emerging, and are ripe for consideration, development, and implementation by the European institutions.

AB  - This conceptual paper focuses on the Agro-Food Hub paradigm as the main enabler for the sustainable development of agro-food Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the context of the currently established agro-food systems. This paper is based on a shared knowledge-driven research that presents different approaches/types of Agro-Food Hubs, providing useful insights into the strategic, operational and institutional approaches of the topic. After the illustration of the main approaches for the Agro-Food Hubs met in the literature, a holistic Agro-Food Hubs model was proposed (the Agro-Food Sustainability Knowledge Hub model), incorporating the main principles and functional guidelines within the framework of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Sustainable Supply Chain Management. This study is in line with the demographic, economic and social prospects for the 2050 and the European Economic and Social Committee decision for "An EU Industrial Policy for the Food and Drinks Sector" adopted on 4 May 2015. In particular, since the majority of research in the past focused on large organizations, this paper is expected to enlighten the problems emerged from current applied practices together with the opportunities for potential synergies among agricultural SMEs, through the utilization of alternative sustainable channels of distribution and value creation, such as the Agro-Food Hubs.

AB  - Agriculture and food systems are important determinants of nutrition and consequent public health. However, an understanding of the links among agriculture, food systems, nutrition, public health and the associated policy levers, is relatively under-developed. A framework conceptualizing these key relationships, relevant to a range of country contexts, would help inform policymakers as to how agriculture and food policy could improve nutrition and public health, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). The objectives of this paper are: to present a conceptual framework, relevant to a range of country contexts and focused on the policymaker as the user, which depicts the key relationships among agriculture, the food system, nutrition and public health; and to describe how the framework can be used for understanding the impacts of agriculture and food system policies on nutrition outcomes. Existing conceptual frameworks, highlighting the relationships among agriculture, the food system, nutrition and public health (n = 37) were identified, reviewed and categorized, based on the key themes they address. Building on this analysis and synthesis a conceptual framework was developed that assists in identifying associated policy levers and their effects on elements of the framework. The end product is a conceptual framework that presents key domains linking agriculture and food systems to nutritional outcomes and public health. The framework is relevant to a range of contexts, for example low-, middle- and high-income settings; and to policymakers wishing to examine the potential direct and indirect impacts of agriculture and food system policies.

AB  - A decision-support system was developed to assist small-scale producers, consultants, and extension agents with analyzing expected yield improvements, input cost savings, and equipment efficiency gains associated with global positioning system guidance on tractors using farm-specific details. Default parameters may be modified to perform partial budgeting and break-even analyses on a whole-farm basis. Findings suggest that this technology is profitable on as few as 49 ha, considered small-scale in the region, and under farm conditions assessed within. Further, tractor guidance is more feasible the more input-intensive the crops (e.g. cotton production vs. pasture maintenance) and the more expensive the equipment (e.g. using newer equipment). Changing input use affects greenhouse gas emissions that are reported as carbon equivalent footprint changes due to tractor guidance. For example, changing to tractors with lower horsepower to save on capital investment needs without changing the size of implement drawn, lowers fuel footprint as long as technically feasible and possible from a perspective of completing field work in a timely manner. Also, using manure instead of synthetic fertilizer, while economically advantageous, will increase the footprint of fertilizer applications given, among other factors, lesser nutrient density and thereby greater handling costs with manures. Quantifying these impacts across a whole farm is cumbersome since tractor guidance affects annual equipment use hours that are difficult to track and yet economically important. Hence, the decision support system was designed to capture farm-specific detail. The ability to perform whole-farm planning and sensitivity analyses in an automated, user-friendly, and flexible fashion is expected to increase technology adoption by small-scale producers.

AB  - A new proposed framework to assess sustainability impacts of maritime spatial plans (MSP-SA) utilises the ecosystem service (ES) concept to address the often-lacking social sustainability of the plans. This study departs in the MSP-SA framework and applies it to the (emerging) sea use of mussel farming. Informed by a literature review and two surveys, it is investigated whether the benefits and impacts of mussel farming can be related to underlying ES and relevant planning questions. The results show that most benefits and impacts of mussel farming can be connected to ES and reveal different user-environment-beneficiary interactions, ranging from conflicts to synergies. The marine planning framework is structured into different planning phases and it is shown that the ES concept can contribute to a normative vision, strategic objectives, and site-specific operational questions. Studying the different user-environment-beneficiary interactions can reveal who benefits and who loses from planning decisions. While the marine planning framework developed in this study is targeted at mussel farming, the approach can be adapted to other uses and planning areas and can contribute to social and equity aspects in MSP by considering the receivers of (dis)benefits.

AB  - Humanity faces the challenge of how to achieve a high quality of life for over 7 billion people without destabilizing critical planetary processes. Using indicators designed to measure a 'safe and just' development space, we quantify the resource use associated with meeting basic human needs, and compare this to downscaled planetary boundaries for over 150 nations. We find that no country meets basic needs for its citizens at a globally sustainable level of resource use. Physical needs such as nutrition, sanitation, access to electricity and the elimination of extreme poverty could likely be met for all people without transgressing planetary boundaries. However, the universal achievement of more qualitative goals (for example, high life satisfaction) would require a level of resource use that is 2-6 times the sustainable level, based on current relationships. Strategies to improve physical and social provisioning systems, with a focus on sufficiency and equity, have the potential to move nations towards sustainability, but the challenge remains substantial.

AB  - In China, the Grain for Green Program (GGP) is an ambitious project to convert croplands into natural vegetation, but exactly how changes in vegetation translate into changes in soil organic carbon remains less clear. Here we conducted a meta-analysis using 734 observations to explore the effects of land recovery on soil organic carbon and nutrients in four provinces in Southwest China. Following GGP, the soil organic carbon content (SOCc) and soil organic carbon stock (SOCs) increased by 33.73% and 22.39%, respectively, compared with the surrounding croplands. Similarly, soil nitrogen increased, while phosphorus decreased. Outcomes were heterogeneous, but depended on variations in soil and environmental characteristics. Both the regional land use and cover change indicated by the landscape type transfer matrix and net primary production from 2000 to 2020 further confirmed that the GGP promoted the forest area and regional mean net primary production. Our findings suggest that the GGP could enhance soil and vegetation carbon sequestration in Southwest China and help to develop a carbon-neutral strategy.

AB  - CONTEXT: Transition to sustainable agriculture is in many cases hindered by a web of interconnected barriers across agricultural system levels (cropping, farming and agrifood systems), involving a diverse range of stakeholders (e.g., farmers, marketing companies, input providers, R&D). This calls for the coordinated design of innovations across levels to bring about major changes towards agroecological practices. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we devised and tested a method for the design of coupled innovations on soil health management in sheltered vegetable cropping systems, in south-eastern France. METHODS: We developed a workshop-based approach grounded on 4 principles: (1) innovation design relying on generativity, combination of independent knowledge sources, and creation of open social spaces; (2) participatory design with researchers-facilitators and stakeholder-experts; (3) progressive exploration of the problem complexity; and (4) use of intermediary objects to facilitate linkages across levels and stakeholders, and the evaluation of the innovations. Following a 3-steps approach, we explored innovations at increasing levels of complexity and diversity in participants, with each step's outcomes feeding the next one. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: With the participation of 34 stakeholders, we progressively designed three final coupled innovation prototypes targeting three key areas for innovation in our case study: (1) crop diversification; (2) application of biologically active amendments; and (3) integration of agroecological techniques and its optimization. We asked the participants to evaluate these three prototypes based on stakeholder criteria that we had previously characterized. We also produced complementary resources to move from the refined innovation concepts to their implementation: (a) 16 'simple' innovations and 37 complementary 'coupled' innovations, both original and adapted to the context of our case studyand (b) knowledge gaps to be filled. Examples of designed coupled innovations are: (i) organic mulching cropping system combined with on-farm organic mulch production (farm coupled innovation); (ii) crop diversification combined with plot exchange with neighboring farmer (farmer-farmer coupled innovation); and (iii) making soil health status explicitly transparent in field transactions combined with agroecological soil health management (agrifood system coupled innovations). SIGNIFICANCE: This workshop-based method is the last component of an original approach to support the agroecological transition of agrifood systems, initiated by a sociotechnical analysis and a tracking for coupled innovation. It enables the coordination of the innovation design across system levels and the agrifood system's stakeholders.

AB  - Throughout the United States, urban food systems are in suboptimal states that are not operating efficiently or equitably and thus do not support food security for all. Creating transformation to a more sustainable and desirable state first requires acknowledging the different values of diverse groups within a city. Then these diverse values can be used to explore pluralistic pathways to futures that maximize benefits for multiple stakeholders. We demonstrate how integrating visioning and Q-methodology can achieve an inclusive understanding of values as priorities for such a food system. Applied in Flint, Michigan, a post-industrial Rust Belt city, this approach can shape the planning process for cities experiencing food insecurity. Qualitative analysis of data from a visioning workshop resulted in sixteen values as priorities for a sustainable and desirable food system. Values as priorities were then ranked in a Q-sort activity, from which three unique groups of ranking patterns emerged, each of which can be interpreted as a vision for a better future. The three visions were a food system with healthy foods that residents are willing to travel for; a food system with convenient, fresh food options for those who cannot travel; and a food system that maintains the community's food traditions. Our novel mixed methods approach empowers communities by giving them a voice in the planning process but also allows decision makers to create transformation pathways that more accurately reflect the needs of the various subsets of community members who hold diverse visions and priorities.

AB  - Knowledge about fossil energy use in agricultural systems is needed, because it can improve the understanding of how to reduce the unsustainable use of limited energy resources and the following greenhouse gas emissions. This study describes and validates a model to assess fossil energy use in Danish agriculture; gives an example of how the model can be used to compare organic and conventional farming; and discusses the implications and potentials of using the model to simulate energy use in scenarios of agricultural production. The model is a development of an existing model, which was too coarse to predict measured energy use on Danish farms. The model was validated at the field operational, the crop type, and the national level, and can supplement the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change manual to quantify fossil energy use and subsequent carbon dioxide emissions from agriculture. The model can be used to model energy use as one indicator in a multi-criteria evaluation of sustainability, also including other agroecological and socio-economic indicators. As an example, energy use for eight conventional and organic crop types on loamy, sandy, and irrigated sandy soil was compared. The energy use was generally lower in the organic than in the conventional system, but yields were also lower. Consequently, conventional crop production had the highest energy production, whereas organic crop production had the highest energy efficiency. Generally, grain cereals such as wheat have a lower energy use per area than roughage crops such as beets. However, because of higher roughage crop yields per area, energy use per feed unit was higher in the roughage crops. Energy use for both conventional cattle and pig production was found to be higher than that for organic production. With respect to fossil energy use per produced livestock unit, agro-ecosystems producing pigs were in both cases less energy effective than those producing cattle. Fossil energy use for three scenarios of conversion to organic farming with increasing fodder import was compared to current conventional farming in Denmark. The scenario with the highest fodder import showed the highest energy use per livestock unit produced. In all scenarios, the energy use per unit produced was lower than in the present situation. However, the total Danish crop production was also lower. In conclusion, the model can be used to simulate scenarios, which can add new information to the discussion of future, sustainable agricultural production. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Sustainable agriculture in arid and semi-arid regions faces unique challenges that require targeted assessment and intervention. Addressing the knowledge gap in this context, the current study evaluates the sustainability performance of 50 rainfed farms in the Za & euml;r Region of northwestern Morocco using farming systems sustainability), which encompasses agro-ecological, social and economic criteria to assess the three pillars of sustainability. Customized assessment criteria and a tailored scoring system, specific to the region's context, are employed, resulting in a comprehensive grid with 18 indicators across nine components. Data analysis and visualization were facilitated using statistical methods and an Excel macro. The findings reveal limitations in the sustainability of the surveyed farms. Socio-territorial factors, including issues with product quality, insufficient farmer training, limited workforce mobilization and low social involvement, contribute to the overall sustainability challenges. Agroecologically, low crop diversification, inadequate space management, and excessive reliance on chemical inputs are identified as areas of concern. On the economic scale, low specialization levels hinder economic viability despite some financial autonomy. The study emphasizes the need for interventions to enhance sustainability in rainfed agrosystems. Recommendations are provided to address socio-territorial constraints, improve agricultural practices, and promote economic viability. The findings have implications for policymakers, farmers and stakeholders, offering valuable insights for prioritizing strategies and actions to achieve sustainable agriculture in arid and semi-arid regions.

AB  - Global food security is being threatened by the reduction of high-quality cropland, extreme weather events, and the uncertainty of food supply chains. The globalization of agricultural trade has elevated the diversification of non-grain production (NGP) on cultivated land to a prominent strategy for poverty alleviation in numerous developing nations. Its rapid expansion has engendered a multitude of deleterious consequences on both food security and ecological stability. NGP in China is becoming very common in the process of rapid urbanization, threatening national food security. To better understand the causal mechanisms and enable governments to balance food security and rural development, it is crucial to have a clear understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of NGP using remote sensing. Yet knowledge gaps remain concerning how to use remote sensing to track human-dominated or -induced long-term cultivated land changes. Our study proposed a method for detecting the spatiotemporal evolution of NGP based on Landsat time-series data under the Google Earth Engine platform. This approach was proposed by (1) obtaining the union of cultivated lands from multiple landcover products to minimize the cultivated land omission, (2) constructing multi-index dynamic trend rules for 3 representative types of NGP and obtaining results at the pixel level, while adopting the continuous change detection and classification algorithm to Landsat time series (1986-2022) to determine when the most recent change occurred, (3) minimizing the noise by object-oriented land use-land cover classification and mode filter approaches, and (4) mapping the spatiotemporal distribution of NGP. The proposed methodology was tested in Jiashan, located in Zhejiang Province (eastern China), where NGP is widespread. We achieved a high overall accuracy of 95.67% for NGP type detection and an overall accuracy of 85.26% for change detection of time. The results indicated a continued increasing pattern of NGP in Jiashan from 1986 to 2022, with the cumulative percentage of NGP increasing from 0.02% to 20.69%. This study highlights the utilization of time-series data to document essential NGP information for evaluating food security in China and the method is well-suited for large-scale mapping due to its automatic manner.

AB  - Cover crops are known to positively impact soil health, both at a physical level (through erosion control and organic matter enhancement) and at a biological level (by fostering more diverse microbial communities). However, most research in this area has been conducted in the context of annual cover crops that are terminated when the main crop is planted. We have previously demonstrated that a continuous "living mulch" cover crop system can enhance the physical and chemical aspects of soil health; In this study, we reveal its effect on the soil bacterial community and compare it to two different annual cover crops and a conventional control without cover crops. We examined the effect of a living-mulch (LM) system using perennial white clover (Trifolium pratense L), annual cereal rye (Secale cereale L.) (CR), annual crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.) (CC), and a no-cover (NC) control at three time points during the 2018 growing season. 16S rRNA amplicon analysis of the soil bacterial community revealed that the community composition in cover crop systems was significantly different from the NC control, and that LM and CR accommodated more heterogeneous and even bacterial communities compared to the NC control. The difference in bacterial composition between cover crop systems appears to be partly influenced by soil nitrogen concentration and lime buffer capacity. Overall community diversity was associated with nitrogen and metal ion concentrations, and these associations were both stronger and more numerous later in the season. These results elucidate how a perennial cover crop system affects the soil bacterial community and advance our understanding of the interactions between crops, management practices, and soil microbiomes in sustainable agriculture.

AB  - Background. U.S. households produce a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions, indicating a potential to reduce their carbon footprints from changing food, energy, and water (FEW) consumption patterns. Behavioral change to FEW consumption is needed, but difficult to achieve. Interactive and engaging approaches like serious games could be a way to increase awareness of possible measures, leading to more sustainable behavior at a household level. This study looks into the experiences and effects of a digital game for homeowners with the potential to reduce FEW resource consumption impacts. Intervention. In this study, we developed and implemented a digital game to explore its potential to raise awareness of the consumption and conservation of FEW resources and the efficacy of conservation messages. This study aims to measure learning outcomes from game participation and to assess the suitability of the game for informing resource conservation actions. Methods. We tested a proof-of-concept of a digital four-player game, called HomeRUN, with 28 homeowners. The data collected include homeowners' values and preferences with regard to FEW resources. The patterns of game actions are analyzed with an emphasis on the effectiveness of conservation messaging in informing household consumption behavior. Results. About 65% of the respondents agree that they gained a better understanding of the greenhouse gas emission impacts of FEW resource consumption after playing the game. Over 57% of the respondents agree that the game experience would influence their future consumption behavior, while a quarter of the respondents are unsure. Overall, we demonstrate the HomeRUN game has potential as a tool for informing conservation efforts at a household level.

AB  - The potential risk of pesticide exposure in developing countries needs further study as data are limited and simple tools to assess the risks on human health and the environment caused by pesticides are lacking. This article introduces a potential pesticides exposure index (PPEI) as a modeling tool to assess the risk of human and environmental pesticide exposure in agricultural basins. The PPEI is based on a number of factors including: human population centers and their proximity to agricultural crops, the toxicological properties of pesticides, and their application frequency. The index was applied to a region in southern Ecuador (approximately 7200 km(2)) where corn, rice, and sugarcane are the predominant crops, and where hot spots with the highest vulnerability to pesticide residues were identified. Of the total of 5326 neighborhoods for the entire study area, 1030 had high, 1124 had medium, and 1009 had low PPEI scores. Among the practical uses of PPEI are to help to assist regulatory agencies and academics evaluate the effects of land use policies on pesticide vulnerability. Also, it can be easily expanded to include other parameters, such as data from other agricultural crops, or frequency of pesticide application. The PPEI can be a valuable indicator of risk of pesticide exposure, as it is reliable and applicable to developing countries, where data and resources are limited. (C) 2021 SETAC

AB  - Poultry production faces increasing environmental challenges, in the United States and globally. Although the environmental impact of poultry production has been decreased, regulatory and social pressures mandate that further improvements be made to decrease the pollution potential even more. Concerns over air and water quality to date have been related primarily to nutrient issues, specifically N and P. Air emission concerns include N and sulfur emissions. More recently, states have addressed emissions of volatile organic compounds. Although no regulations have been developed that are targeted at food production, greenhouse gas emissions are receiving a great deal of attention in the United States. Nutrient-related water quality concerns have focused on N and P contributions to ground and surface waters, respectively. To address nutrient-related air and water quality concerns, nutritional strategies have focused on reducing nutrient excretions. These strategies have been very successful. However, strategies beyond just reducing nutrient excesses will be needed to meet future challenges that are not nutrient-related. Challenges such as pathogens, antimicrobials, and endocrine-disrupting compounds have received considerable attention recently. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the findings from nutrition research with respect to reducing environmental impact and to identify areas that merit attention in the near future, recognizing that many of the emerging environmental issues are not nutrient-related.

AB  - The agricultural sector plays a pivotal role in driving the economy of many developing countries. Any dent in this economical structure may have a severe impact on a country's population. With rising climate change and increasing pollution, the agricultural sector is experiencing significant damage. Over time this cumulative damage will affect the integrity of food crops and create food security issues around the world. Therefore, an early warning system is needed to detect possible stress on food crops. Here we present a review of the recent developments in nanomaterial-based Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) substrates which could be utilized to monitor agricultural crop responses to natural and anthropogenic stress. Initially, our review delves into diverse and cost-effective strategies for fabricating SERS substrates, emphasizing their intelligent utilization across various agricultural scenarios. In the second phase of our review, we spotlight the specific application of SERS in addressing critical food security issues. By detecting nutrients, hormones, and effector molecules in plants, SERS provides valuable insights into plant health. Furthermore, our exploration extends to the detection of contaminants, chemicals, and foodborne pathogens within plants, showcasing the versatility of SERS in ensuring food safety. The cumulative knowledge derived from these discussions illustrates the transformative potential of SERS in bolstering the agricultural economy. By enhancing precision in nutrient management, monitoring plant health, and enabling rapid detection of harmful substances, SERS emerges as a pivotal tool in promoting sustainable and secure agricultural practices. Its integration into agricultural processes not only augments productivity but also establishes a robust defence against potential threats to crop yield and food quality. As SERS continues to evolve, its role in shaping the future of agriculture becomes increasingly pronounced, promising a paradigm shift in how we approach and address challenges in food production and safety.

AB  - 3D - Danube Delta Decarbonising is an essential concept that promotes the maintenance of swamps and wetlands of the Danube and the adaptation of their socio-economic system to climate change. The relationship between climate change, atmospheric structure and greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other critical factors for the global environment, such as alteration of the water cycle, changes in biogeochemical cycles, erosion of soils and coastal areas, reduction of sea salinity, loss biodiversity, is a complex of specificities for the Danube Delta, given the duration of processes, diversity, and causality, both endogenous and exogenous system, and requires analysis of different variants and intensities of manifestation as an objective need for the functioning of the hydro-geo- morphological (HGM) and socio-ecological (SSE) of the Danube Delta. Wetlands such as the Danube Delta are a major source of methane (CH4) and contribute between 30 and 40% to total CH4 emissions. CH4 emissions from wetlands depend on temperature, groundwater depth, and the quantity and quality of organic matter. Global warming will affect these three factors of methanogenesis, raising questions about the feedback between natural methane production and climate change. Forecasts show that by the end of this century, natural methane (CH4) emissions from wetlands are expected to increase by up to 80% by the turn of the century if no concrete measures are taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and especially those generated by the anthropogenic factor, a better understanding of the situation is needed for future rebalancing. The scientific community agrees that an economic system based on fossil fuels, intensive agriculture, and the unsustainable exploitation of global natural resources have irreversible effects on the environment. The effects of the current economic system have detrimental effects on the Danube Delta, such as climate change, air and ocean pollution, and ecological decline, causing material and human damage to the local population. Thus, there is a real risk of catastrophic damage to our economies and societies over the next few decades, if the prevailing forms of production and consumption are not radically changed.

AB  - Humans can derive the benefits from the ecosystem to satisfy human needs as well-being. Therefore, good ecosystem management is the intermediary between ecosystems and human well-being. The ecosystem services depend on the supply of nature, and also reflect the value orientation of human beings, as the basis for the realization of human survival and cultural development. Land ecosystem services are the core and hot topic of ecological research. Under the current severe depletion of land use, this research evaluates the sustainable governance on the natural resource shortage, serious environmental pollution and ecosystem degradation. Based on the Web of Science database, this paper analyzes the development characteristics and trends of global land ecosystem services research using the Bibliometrix software package. The results show that (1) the amount of literature on land ecosystem services research between 2000 and 2019 has generally increased significantly, and entered a stage of rapid development from 2015. (2) Developed countries are the main research force in the field of land ecosystem services, and the United States has the absolute leading position. Developing countries are dominated by China, Argentina, and Brazil. (3) The high-frequency keywords for land ecosystem services are land use change, land use, climate change, urbanization, carbon and water quality. This can be regarded as a research hotspot in the field of land ecosystem services to a certain extent. (4) Through cluster analysis on the big data, the research found the direction for the future land ecosystem services, mainly: (I) the restoration of degraded land and its impact on ecosystem services; (II) the environmental impact assessment of land use planning based on the ecosystem services value; (III) the tradeoff analysis of ecosystem services in sustainable land management; (IV) the impact of land cover change on ecosystem services; (V) through the historical analysis of citied papers, the research history and evolution path of land ecosystem services are explored. Based on all these arguments, a comprehensive study on the diverse facets of land ecosystem services and the practical application of land ecosystem services areas is proposed.

AB  - BackgroundHeat stress negatively affects poultry welfare, including the Japanese quail, especially in sub-Saharan African countries. The quail is vital to research and protein food security, which are affected by global warming. This study identified and reviewed the literature on the impact of heat stress on the Japanese quail organs to provide context for the problem and ways to mitigate it.Main bodyEligible studies for this scoping review must be primarily animal-based experiments that include Japanese quail exposure to acute or chronic heat stress. Systematic reviews, theses and dissertations that meet these criteria were also eligible for use in this review. Reports that involved other types of quail species, eggs and or cell lines were not eligible and were excluded. The databases that were searched include MEDLINE (via PubMed), SCOPUS, CAB Abstracts (via CAB Direct) and Web of Sciences (All databases). A total of 4598 records were identified. After removing 105 duplicates, 4461 and 9 were excluded during the level 1 and 2 screening, respectively. Finally, 24 papers were included for data extraction. All eligible studies were primary animal experiments, and the average heat stress temperature level was 35.3 degrees C. Morphological findings of this scoping review include macrovesicular steatosis in the liver, necrosis of kidney tubular cells, dead and abnormal sperm cells in the testis, lung congestion, and neuronal degeneration resulting from heat stress exposure.ConclusionsHeat stress negatively impacts the organs of the Japanese quail, causing cell death in the liver, brain and testis, which will affect the production and survival of the Japanese quail. In addition, some cost-effective dietary strategies tested in mitigating heat stress were recommended.

AB  - The supply chain systems in the food industry are complex, including manufacturers, dealers, and customers located in different areas. Currently, there is a lack of transparency in the distribution and transaction processes of online food trade. The global food supply chain industry has enormous hurdles because of this problem, as well as a lack of trust among individuals in the sector and a reluctance to share information. This study aims to develop a blockchain-based strawberry supply chain (SSC) framework to create a transparent and secure system for tracking the movement of strawberries from the farm to the consumer. Using Ethereum smart contracts, the proposed solution monitors participant interactions, triggers events, and logs transactions to promote transparency and informed decision-making. The smart contracts also govern interactions between vendors and consumers, such as monitoring the status of Internet of Things (IoT) containers for food supply chains and notifying consumers. The proposed framework can be extended to other supply chain industries in the future to increase transparency and immutability.

AB  - The biochar-agriculture nexus can potentially generate several benefits ranging from soil carbon sequestration to the reduction in nutrient leaching from arable soils. However, leveraging these benefits requires spatially-explicit information on suitable locations for biochar application. This study provides a flexible multicriteria framework that delivers spatial indications on biochar prioritization through a biochar use indication map (BUIM). The framework was exemplified as a case study for Swedish arable land through three different prioritization nar-ratives. The BUIM for all the narratives revealed that a significant fraction of the Swedish arable land could potentially benefit from biochar application. Furthermore, arable land that scored high for a given narrative did not necessarily score high in the others, thus indicating that biochar application schemes can be adjusted to various objectives and local needs. The framework presented here aims to promote the exploration of different avenues for deploying biochar in the agricultural sector.

AB  - Lack of energy for powering irrigation pumps limits off-season production of rice in Malawi. This paper reviews a 10-year historical rice production data from rice farms in Karonga district in Malawi to assess the impact on rice yields and availability of straws and husks for on-site bioenergy production in small scale gasifiers, to power irrigation pumping during off season over a projected period of 15 years. Annual production of rice straw and husks has been estimated using residues to product ratio while taking into account collectable amounts and allocations to competing uses. The heating values obtained from literature and validated by analytical Gross Calorific Values of straws and husks have been used to estimate the bioenergy potential. Irrigation pump capacity and pumping rate calculated from daily water demand, and carbon emissions savings determined from the differences between emissions generated by fossil diesel and bioenergy powered irrigation have been used for calculating environmental benefits. The sales of excess rice provided estimates for financial gains. In the base year, generation of straws and husks of about 44117 and 6703 t and collectable portions of 40% and 65%, respectively, are estimated, providing a total bioenergy potential of 16.64 GWh. With onsite-generated bioenergy, irrigated land can increase from 2367 to 13362 ha while rice and bioenergy production increases from 34703 to 59970 t and 15.34-87.72 GWh, respectively, by the 10th cycle. Cumulative revenue of US $354.60 million from sales of excess rice and net carbon emissions saving of 285.33 kilotonnes can be achieved by using electricity generated for irrigation pumping. Investment costs in electricity generation can breakeven by 8th year if sold at US0.166/kWh. Therefore, on-site generated bioenergy targeting irrigation pumping for off-season rice production is an enabler for promoting positive and sustainable fuel/food nexus in rice farming communities through intensive farming.

AB  - The payment for ecosystem services (PES) scheme shows great poverty alleviation potential and recognizing this connection contributes to enhancing the development of residents in ecologically endowed areas. However, the literature has not clarified the extent of the promotion and moderating factors of PES on income yet. This study pursues the goal of identifying the effect of PES on household income in rural China from the income structure perspective. Methodologically, this research conducts a literature review of 28 papers to outline the effect of PES on agricultural production, off-farm, and total income, and it applies a meta-analysis and meta-regression analysis of 13 papers to identify the influencing degree and interference factors. The findings reveal four issues. Overall, the effect of PES on agricultural production income was negative, while the effect on off-farm and total income was positive. Second, the PES schemes boosted farm household income by 0.15 weighted average effect size. Third, farm household participation area, subsidized unit prices, and urbanization level played positive moderating effects, while farm household age was a negative moderating variable. Lastly, PES risk exacerbated income inequality among farm households. The study also integrates the PES and the SDGs, proposing that advancing climate action involves the assistance of sustainable communities, decent work, and protection from conflict with social equity. Finally, the paper provides recommendations in terms of government-led PES projects that should be inclusive of economic, social, and ecological objectives, provide job security for smallholders, and quality urbanization.

AB  - Land use change and management affect climate by altering both the biogeochemical and biophysical interactions between the land and atmosphere. Whereas climate policy often emphasizes the biogeochemical impact of land use change, biophysical impacts, including changes in reflectance, energy partitioning among sensible and latent heat exchange, and surface roughness, can attenuate or enhance biogeochemical effects at local to regional scales. This study analyzes 3 years (2015-2017) of turbulent flux and meteorological data across three contrasting wetland restoration sites and one agricultural site, colocated in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California, USA, to understand if the biophysical impacts of freshwater wetland restoration can be expected to attenuate or enhance the potential biogeochemical benefits. We show that despite absorbing more net radiation, restored wetlands have the potential to cool daytime surface temperature by up to 5.1 degrees C, as compared to a dominant drained agricultural land use. Wetland canopy structure largely determines the magnitude of surface temperature cooling, with wetlands that contain areas of open water leading to enhanced nighttime latent heat flux and reduced diurnal temperate range. Daytime surface cooling could be important in ameliorating physiological stress associated with hotter and drier conditions and could also promote boundary layer feedbacks at the local to regional scale. With a renewed focus on the mitigation and adaptation potential of natural and working lands, we must better understand the role of biophysical changes, especially in novel land use transitions like wetland restoration. Plain Language Summary: Land use change and management affect climate by altering both the cycling of greenhouse gases and how energy and water are exchanged between the ecosystem and the atmosphere. These energy and water impacts can have local to regional implications on surface and air temperature. This study analyzes 3 years (2015-2017) of measured water and energy exchange at three contrasting wetland restoration sites and one agricultural site, all located in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California, USA. Restoring drained agricultural fields to flooded wetlands causes a rougher canopy, with more exposed water, and alters the energy partitioning. This results in growing season and daytime surface cooling, which could enhance the other benefits of wetland restoration, like soil buildup, habitat creation, and carbon sequestration. Land use policies should consider both the greenhouse gas and the energy and water implications of the promoted land use change to fully account for the climatic impact.

AB  - The ability to incorporate and manage the different drivers of land-use change in a modeling process is one of the key challenges because they are complex and are both quantitative and qualitative in nature. This paper uses Bayesian belief networks (BBN) to incorporate characteristics of land managers in the modeling process and to enhance our understanding of land-use change based on the limited and disparate sources of information. One of the two models based on spatial data represented land managers in the form of a quantitative variable, the area of individual holdings, whereas the other model included qualitative data from a survey of land managers. Random samples from the spatial data provided evidence of the relationship between the different variables, which I used to develop the BBN structure. The model was tested for four different posterior probability distributions, and results showed that the trained and learned models are better at predicting land use than the uniform and random models. The inference from the model demonstrated the constraints that biophysical characteristics impose on land managers; for older land managers without heirs, there is a higher probability of the land use being arable agriculture. The results show the benefits of incorporating a more complex notion of land managers in land-use models, and of using different empirical data sources in the modeling process. Future research should focus on incorporating more complex social processes into the modeling structure, as well as incorporating spatio-temporal dynamics in a BBN.

AB  - African agriculture Is largely traditional-characterized Dy a large number of smallholdings of no more than one ha per household. Crop production takes place under extremely variable agro-ecological conditions, with annual rainfall ranging from 250 to 750 mm in the Sahel in the northwest and in the semi-arid east and south, to 1500 to 4000 mm in the forest zones in the central west. Farmers often select well-adapted, stable crop varieties, and cropping systems are such that two or more crops are grown in the same field at the same time. These diverse traditional systems enhance natural enemy abundance and generally keep pest numbers at low levels. Pest management practice in traditional agriculture is a built-in process in the overall crop production system rather than a separate well-defined activity. Increased population pressure and the resulting demand for increased crop production in Africa have necessitated agricultural expansion with the concomitant decline in the overall biodiversity. Increases in plant material movement in turn facilitated the accidental introduction of foreign pests. At present about two dozen arthropod pests, both introduced and native, are recognized as one of the major constraints to agricultural production and productivity in Africa. Although yield losses of 0% to 100% have been observed on-station, the economic significance of the majority of pests under farmers' production conditions is not adequately understood. Economic and social constraints have kept pesticide use in Africa the lowest among all the world regions. The bulk of pesticides are applied mostly against pests of commercial crops such as cotton, vegetables, coffee, and cocoa, and to some extent for combating outbreaks of migratory pests such as the locusts. The majority of African farmers still rely on indigenous pest management approaches to manage pest problems, although many government extension programs encourage the use of pesticides. The current pest management research activities carried out by national or international agricultural research programs in Africa focus on classical biological control and host plant resistance breeding. With the exception of classical biological control of the cassava mealybug, research results have not been widely adopted. This could be due to African farmersfacing heterogeneous conditions, not needing fixed prescriptions or one ideal variety but a number of options and genotypes to choose from. Indigenous pest management knowledge is site-specific and should be the basis for developing integrated pest management (IPM) techniques. Farmers often lack the biological and ecological information necessary to develop better pest management through experimentation. Formal research should be instrumental in providing the input necessary to facilitate participatory technology development such as that done by Farmer Field Schools, an approach now emerging in different parts of Africa.

AB  - The most challenging problem in today's world is food insecurity, an estimated approximately 832 million people around the world suffer from a lack of adequate and healthy food on a regular basis for their life. This problem is likely to intensify around the world due to high political risk and weak institutions. Hence, this study utilizes the country-level data, covering 124 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, Latin America, and the Caribbean between 1984-2018 to examine the impact of political risk and institutions on food security, proxied by Dietary energy supply (DES). We have finalized the System-GMM from Pooled-OLS, Fixed-effect, Difference-GMM, and System- GMM, to recover the potential endogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity of the independent variables. Our outcomes provide supportive evidence that internal and external conflicts, socioeconomic conditions, corruption, military in politics, religious tensions, ethnicity tensions, and poor quality of bureaucracy worsen food security in developed and developing countries. While government stability, the role of law and order, democratic accountability, and investment profile affect the food supply positively and significantly.

AB  - Karst landscape in southwestern China is one of the most typical landscapes developed on carbonate bedrock and has the largest area in the world. Carbon sequestration potentials during secondary karst vegetation recovery remain uncertain. Based on the vegetation map and 87 sampling plots at five stages of natural vegetation succession, this study estimated aboveground (AG) vegetation carbon stocks and dynamics at a watershed scale. AG carbon density of grasslands, shrublands, shrub forests, secondary forests and primary forests was 1.70,4.15, 22.3, 703, 142.2 Mg ha(-1), respectively. The ten most important species stored 71.6-96.1% of total AG carbon stock, indicating that carbon pool in karst vegetation was determined by a few dominant species. Main contributors to AG carbon stock shifted from individuals in small diameter classes in shrublands to individuals in large diameter classes in primary forests, indicating that carbon increases in the early vegetation succession resulted from high recruitment of woody plants, while carbon accumulations in the later forests were mainly due to tree growth. The long time required for secondary forests to recover carbon density to the level of primary forests could be explained by the slow speed of large evergreen trees reaching a high level of dominance during secondary succession on the harsh habitats. The total AG carbon stock of the studied watershed (7.50 x 10(3) ha) was 85.9 x 10(3) Mg, of which paddy fields, dry lands, grasslands, shrublands, shrub forests and secondary forests accounted for 22.6%, 3.49%, 0.34%, 5.97%,12.3% and 55.3%, respectively. The AG carbon stock in this watershed would increase by 92.5% in 50-100 years and by 4.40 times in 140-200 years if the degraded vegetation types could continue to develop into mature forests. Although carbon density of karst forests was significantly lower than that of the forests on non-karst habitats in the same latitudinal zone, the degraded karst vegetation showed a great carbon sequestration potential due to the large distribution area in southwestern China.

AB  - Background: Soil salinity poses a significant threat to agricultural lands by adversely affecting soil properties, crop productivity, and, consequently, global food security. This study evaluated the effects of date palm waste compost (C), applied alone or combined with biochar (BCC) or Ramial chipped wood (RCWC), on soil properties and barley yield under arid and saline conditions. Methods: A field experiment was performed in a completely random design with three replications. In addition to the unamended soil (control), treatments with compost (C), biochar + compost (BCC) and Ramial chipped wood + compost (RCWC) were tested. We monitored soil physico-chemical parameters, straw biomass, grain yield, and soluble sugar levels over two crop seasons. Results: All treatments enhanced soil fertility. However, the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and the cation ratio of soil structural stability (CROSS) increased in soils amended with compost alone in the second crop year. Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivated in soil amended with C and BCC produced 28% and 37% more dry biomass, respectively, in the second year, while no significant effects were observed in the first year. This may be attributed to the higher availability of nutrient content (N and P) in soils during the second year. In the first year, plants amended with BCC exhibited the highest accumulation of sucrose and fructose, with increases of up to 39% and 66%, respectively. Conclusions: Compost application did not affect barley yield during the first crop year, highlighting limited effects on soil fertility. However, C and BCC improved barley yield in the second year after application. No synergistic effect was observed between biochar, Ramial chipped wood, and compost. Future Perspective: Further studies should focus on the long-term effects of organic soil management, including salinity issues, to support sustainable agriculture in arid regions.

AB  - Water scarcity is projected to affect half of the world's population, gradually exacerbated by climate change. This article elaborates from a panel discussion at the 2023 United Nations Water Conference on "Addressing Water Scarcity to Achieve Climate Resilience and Human Health." Understanding and addressing water scarcity goes beyond hydrological water balances to also include societal and economic measures. We consider five categories of health impacts resulting from deteriorating water qualities and quantities: (1) water-related diseases and water for hygiene, (2) malnutrition and water for food, (3) livelihoods, income, development, and water for energy, (4) adverse air quality from drought-induced dust and wildfire smoke, and (5) mental health effects from water scarcity-related factors. A discussion on the barriers and opportunities for resilient water systems begins by reframing water scarcity as a "pathway to water bankruptcy" and introducing Water Partnerships to empower local water leaders with the awareness, education, and resources to devise and implement locally appropriate water management strategies. Other barriers include the (1) lack of tools to consider the socioeconomic implications of water scarcity, (2) lack of water information being in actionable formats for decision-makers, (3) lack of clarity in the application of water scarcity modeling to gain policy-relevant findings, and (4) inadequate drought adaptation planning. The article includes recommendations for local governments, national governments, international actors, researchers, nongovernmental organizations, and local constituents in addressing these barriers. The predominant theme in these recommendations is collaborative, multidisciplinary Water Partnerships, knowledge-sharing in accessible formats, and empowering participation by all. This article's central thesis is that addressing water scarcity must focus on people and their ability to lead healthy and productive lives. Key points This article's central thesis is that addressing water scarcity must focus on people and their ability to lead healthy and productive lives.The predominant theme is to empower water users for decision-making roles in water management, made possible through Water Partnerships where trusted partners and stakeholders help inform water users' decision-making.A discussion on the barriers and opportunities for resilient water systems begins by reframing water scarcity as a "pathway to water bankruptcy," which allows for alternative decision-making approaches for water management.

AB  - Industrialized farming practices result in simplified agricultural landscapes, reduced biodiversity, and degraded species-interaction networks. Thus far, most research assessing the combined effects of farming systems and landscape complexity on beneficial insects has been conducted in relatively diversified and mesic systems and may not represent the large-scale, monoculture-based dryland agriculture that dominates many regions worldwide. Specifically, the effects of farming systems on forbs, bees, and their interactions are poorly understood in highly simplified dryland landscapes such as those in the Northern Great Plains, United States, an area globally important for conventional and organic small grain, pulse, forage, and oilseed production. During a 3-yr (2013-2015) study, we assessed 1) the effects of dryland no-till conventional and tilled organic farming on forbs, bees, and bee- flower networks and 2) the relationship between natural habitat and bee abundance. Flower density and richness were greater in tilled organic fields than in no-till conventional fields, and forb community composition differed between farming systems. We observed high bee diversity (109 taxa) in this highly simplified landscape, and bee abundance, richness, and community composition were similar between systems. Compared with tilled organic fields, bee-flower interactions in no-till conventional fields were poorly connected, suggesting these systems maintain relatively impoverished plant-pollinator networks. Natural habitat (11% of the landscape) did not affect small-bodied bee abundance in either farming system but positively affected large-bodied bees within 2,000 m of crop-field centers. In highly simplified agricultural landscapes, dryland organic farming and no-till conventional farming together support relatively high bee diversity, presumably because dryland organic farming enhances floral resources and bee-flower networks, and no-till management in conventional farming provides undisturbed ground-nesting habitats for wild bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea).

AB  - This article deals broadly with the receptiveness of domestic institutions to international regimes, applying an organizational theoretical approach. More specifically, the aim is to explore how international obligations emanating from multilateral agreements on environment and trade affect Norwegian agricultural policy. Multifunctionality has been portrayed as an adept way of adjusting agricultural policy to the World Trade Organization by tapping into the environmental potential. However, closer scrutiny disclosed that this potential for environmental improvements has hardly been utilized. Partly accounting for this situation is the relatively weak role of the Ministry of the Environment in policy-making compared to the highly institutionalized domestic interest groups associated with agriculture. The organizational field of agriculture has remained very strong, and hardly subject to normative persuasion from relatively weak international environmental regimes. Moreover, while Norwegian environmental non-governmental organizations do have the potential to affect policies, there is very little evidence of pressure for utilizing the environmental potential of multifunctionality. This study points out the strong alliance between rural and environmental grassroots organizations in Norway, with more harmonious relations than those at the ministerial level.

AB  - Aquatic pollution associated with agriculture is a problem that has been receiving increasing attention in the European Union (EU). The EU's Nitrates Directive (91/676EC) and its associated Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) legislation were extended in Scotland in 2003, requiring more farmers to adopt more sustainable land management practices. This paper presents results from a qualitative socio-economic study of the motivations and management practices of 30 farmers located within the Strathmore and Fife NVZ. It was found that these farmers rarely consider environmental issues beyond the boundaries of their farms unless the productive capacity and economic viability of their farms are affected. Despite contrary evidence, the farmers did not believe that they were responsible for any water quality problems, nor is the intrinsic linkage between catchment and coastal zone management established in their minds. They were suspicious of agri-environmental funding opportunities, and tend to regard the bureaucracy involved in applying for funding as more of a problem than it is worth. Experience of environmental regulations has left many with concerns about rules changing in unfavourable ways. Many of the farmers are dependent on Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) subsidy support, and the proposed de-coupling of direct payments from production is regarded with suspicion. Current NVZ regulations will impact most on milk and intensive livestock producers but our results indicate that even if the legislation is followed exactly, the desired environmental benefits are unlikely to be realised because most farmers claim already to be managing nutrients within allowable limits.

AB  - Fertilizer trees and shrubs can improve degraded soil and avert the impacts of climate change on smallholder farmers in Malawi. This paper analyses the roles of fertilizer trees and shrubs and factors that determine adoption, as well as the intensity of use of fertilizer on trees and shrubs in maize-based farming systems using the Tobit model. A household survey involving 250 smallholder farmers was conducted in Salima district, Malawi. The analysis shows that adopters of fertilizer trees and shrubs considered fertility improvement, shade, source of food and erosion control as main roles of fertilizer trees and shrubs. The Tobit model shows that households with relatively more land are more likely to adopt fertilizer trees and shrubs than those with small land sizes. Adoption is higher among farmers who had been exposed to fertilizer trees and shrubs for longer periods than others had. Land tenure, education and availability of labor also influence the adoption of fertilizer trees and shrubs. Results further show that household and farm characteristics and availability of extension services explain the current adoption rates of tree-fertilizer technologies. Our findings can guide effective targeting of farmers to ensure higher adoption and sustainability of fertilizer-tree and shrub technology for climate-smart agriculture among the smallholder farmers.

AB  - Promoting the sustainable agricultural practices at an individual farm level is essential to ensure agricultural sustainability. This study analyzed whether and how various factors related to farm or farmers' characteristics influence the adoption intensity of sustainable agriculture practices. We used a negative binomial regression model to fit the data collected from a mail survey of farmers in Kentucky, USA. Our results showed that the adoption intensity of sustainable agriculture practices varied significantly among agricultural districts in Kentucky. Farmers who grew row crops, had irrigation facilities, and were in favor of crop diversification were significantly more likely than their respective counterparts to adopt more sustainable agriculture practices. Similarly, having a college education and participating in the Tobacco Buyout Program also positively and significantly affected the intensity of adopting sustainable agriculture practices among Kentucky farmers. In contrast, a lack of adequate knowledge about sustainable farming and an unfamiliarity with technology significantly and negatively related to less adoption of sustainable agriculture practices.

AB  - We formulate an agent-based simulation model to analyze farmers' decision-making in bioenergy crops adoption and predict related farmers' group behavior. Agents include farmers and biofuel producers, and each is represented with their own decision-making mechanism. We quantitatively model the decision making of farmers in Iowa, USA as an optimization model based on values derived from published literature and social survey data; results were further validated with social survey data. Economic and environmental impacts of growing conventional row crops versus dedicated energy crops are considered and evaluated under a series of operational constraints including neighborhood influence. We apply the model to forecast biomass supply in the next three decades and reveal that Iowa has the potential to produce 2.27 billion gallons (8.59 billion liters) of cellulosic biofuel by 2022, which constitutes 14.2% of RFS2 cellulosic ethanol mandate. We also find improved publicity to be more efficient in promoting biomass production than raising the contract price. This paper provides a new approach to study farmers' behavior, and insights we derive on managerial operations may be of interest to bioenergy investors, producers, and government policy makers.

AB  - Biotechnology is the exploitation of biotechnological methods, systems and agents like animals, plants, microorganisms and substances derived from them in solving the world Food Energy, Environmental and Health problems. Millions of people in the world are facing starvation as food shortages loom and crop prices continually increase. The impact is spreading from the developing to the developed countries. The global concern about food security is an important factor for economic development and growth of nations. Biotechnology approach to the production of seedlings and animal husbandry will lead to improvement in the quality and quantity of food production globally. Agricultural biotechnology remains the only way in transforming Agriculture and ensuring food security globally.

AB  - The agricultural commodity market is sensitive to variations in weather and climate, which can disrupt supply and cause price fluctuations. Some of the key positive and negative impacts of climate change on agricultural commodities, using the examples of wheat and barley, are identified; of particular significance are temperature changes, water availability, and CO2 fertilization. Although they are not exempt from the negative impacts of climate change, higher latitude regions of production, including Canada and Russia, will benefit the most from climate change. The impacts on other important production regions, such as parts of Europe, the US, and Argentina, will be more mixed. Market stability in all regions will also be affected by changes in climate and weather extremes. To increase resilience to the effects of weather events and climate change on the agricultural commodity market, countries should diversify their sources of supply, encourage more countries to grow and export the relevant commodities, and support crop research and climate adaptation. Policy relevance Climate change will substantially affect future food security and the price of agricultural commodities. This study takes a broad approach to identify the key aspects of the agricultural commodities market that are vulnerable to climate change and suggests ways in which policy makers might improve its resilience.

AB  - Climate change may impact agricultural greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) and yields under higher temperatures, higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and variable precipitations. This calls for adaptation strategies to optimize agricultural productions with minimal GHGs. This study aimed to identify these optimum agricultural managements in response to current and projected climatic scenarios for the Choctawhatchee Basin in Southeastern USA, an experimentally unexplored data-scarce region lacking validation data. This scenario-based modeling study analyzed a total of 1344 scenarios consisting of four major crops, eight managements (varying tillage, manuring, and residue), and forty climatic combinations under current as wells as two representative concentration pathways with process-based Denitrification and Decomposition (DNDC) model. The results indicated that the region's GHGs and yields were most affected by higher temperatures (>=+3 degrees C) and extreme precipitation changes (>=+/- 40%), while high atmospheric CO2 concentrations exerted positive fertilization effects. The manure-related and higher residue incorporation scenarios were found to be better options in varying climates with minimal present global warming potentials (GWP) of 0.23 k to -29.1 k MT equivalent CO2. As such, the study presented climate change impacts and potential mitigation options in the study region while presenting a framework to design GHG mitigation in similar data-scarce regions.

AB  - Ghanaian smallholders grow one quarter of the world's cocoa, but climate change, individual extreme weather events, such as droughts, as well as deforestation increasingly threaten cocoa production. Pertinent information could bolster adaptive capacity. However, in Ghana's cocoa sector, relevant agricultural information is not available to all farmers, which can exacerbate power asymmetries. This paper focuses on how (i) agricultural and drought-adaptive information and (ii) socio-economic characteristics shape a cocoa farmer's adaptive capacity. We conducted our study in the aftermath of 2015-16's prolonged El Nino-induced drought that negatively impacted the livelihoods of cocoa smallholders across Ghana. In 48 semi-structured interviews and 12 focus groups, we asked smallholders how they responded to the drought to decipher how adaptive capacity compares between farmers receiving four different sources of agricultural information, and of diverse socio-economic status. Overall, agricultural information improved cocoa farmers' adaptive capacity compared to those who received no formal agricultural information. Smallholders detailed adaptive techniques that would be accessible to, and thus replicable by, other poorly-resourced cocoa farmers. Shade tree management and income diversification were identified as pertinent adaptive actions. However, we identified a divergence between exposure to agricultural information and its transformation into substantive adaptive action. Additionally, informal information sharing between smallholders represents an underutilized resource by extension programmes. We found that adaptive capacity is also determined by socio-economic characteristics: particularly gender, and to a lesser extent formal education level, proximity to asphalt roads, and land tenure. Finally, we present evidence that framing adaptive techniques in relatable terms that resonate with farmers' immediate livelihood concerns could narrow the adaptation deficit prevalent in Ghana's cocoa sector.

AB  - Over the last several decades, Brazil has become both the world's leading soy producer and the world's leading consumer of hazardous pesticides. Despite identified links between pesticide exposure and carcinogenesis, there has been little population-level research on the effects of pesticide intensification on broader human health in Brazil. We estimate the relationship between expanded soy production-and related community exposure to pesticides-on childhood cancer incidence using 15 y of data on disease mortality. We find a statistically significant increase in pediatric leukemia following expanded local soy production, but timely access to treatment mitigates this relationship. We show that pesticide exposure likely occurs via water supply penetration. Our findings represent only the tip of the iceberg for substantial health externalities of high-input crop production and land use change. Our results are of particular interest in developing contexts with demand for intensified food production systems and underscore the need for stronger regulation of pesticides and increased public health attention to exposure in the broader community.

AB  - Agriculture in the Southern Great Plains of the United States depends on precipitation and temperature thresholds for productivity. The region's climate and weather are variable, presenting farming challenges that are predicted to increase. Building and conserving healthy, resilient soil is one way farmers manage for future uncertainty. Few studies have compared soil health-managed and conventionally managed farms at the regional scale. To better understand management effects on soil health across the Southern Great Plains, we studied farms at 12 locations. We piloted the study using three of the locations, collecting soils from 10 fields per location and analyzing them for indicators of soil health. Our objective was to test the suitability of our experimental framework and identify additional indicators and analyses of interest. Our framework was generally suitable to the purpose of this study. We also noted that soil health-managed soils had organic matter stratification similar to native soils, which we plan to explore further.

AB  - Malawi's economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, of which a majority are smallholder farmers. With smallholder farmers constituting more than 80% of the population, the government's policies have mainly focused on achieving redistribution goals of the society, minding less about the inefficiencies in smallholder farming. The current study assessed and compared the efficiency levels of large scale and small-scale farmers amidst huge government expenditures in agricultural subsidies on smallholder farmers. Through a SWOT analysis and literature review approach that dwelt much on the qualitative case study approach, the study found that it is only through attaining economies of scale that small farms can attain the efficiency levels of large-scale farms. Following this finding that large farmers are more efficient; the study proposes models that would mimic the behaviour of large farmers. In this study, we evaluated the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of various models proposed to improve efficiency of small farms. Three models were evaluated namely, contract farming, cooperative development and land consolidation models. These models were selected for review because the theory of collective action ensures that they mimic the farm behaviour of a large farmer. The paper recommends a hybrid of land consolidation model with selected elements of contract and cooperative development models.

AB  - The impact of the 'green revolution' on poverty has been the subject of much concern and fears that it leads to impoverishment have affected many people in a position to influence agricultural policy. Real agricultural wages rates have been used as an indicator of poverty, in the absence of more direct measurements. This article starts by examining two recent studies of the trends and regional variations of real agricultural wage rates in Bangladesh both of which argue that agricultural growth has not been favourable to real wage rates. One concludes that there has been an 'alarming' downward trend since the mid-1960s, and the other that the contribution of technological change to labour demand has not been strong. Using more recent information and re-working the original data it appears that these conclusions cannot be supported.

AB  - Reconciling the tasks of producing adequate amounts of nutritious food for the increasing global population while preserving the environment and natural ecosystems simultaneously is an enormous challenge. The concept of agriculture green development (AGD) and the necessary governmental policies were developed to address the aforementioned challenge in China and to help achieve the related global sustainable development goals. Agriculture green development emphasizes the synergy between green and development; current agriculture has to transform from the intensive farming with high inputs, high environmental impacts and low resource -use efficiency to a more sustainable agriculture, in order to ensure an adequate supply of nutritious food while delivering environmental integrity, improved economic profitability, and social equity. A research program on AGD was established by China Agricultural University with four research themes, namely: green crop production, green integrated crop -animal production, green food and industry, and green ecological environment and ecosystem services, to provide a scientific basis for future developments and to facilitate the implementation of AGD in practice. AGD requires a multistakeholder approach, fueled by innovative and interdisciplinary research. Joint actions have to be taken by governments, farmers, supply industries, consumers, educators, extension services and researchers to support AGD. This requires strong coordination and public awareness campaigns. This review presents the progress that has been made over the past 5 years and makes recommendations for more research and development, in order to better deliver agricultural green and sustainable development on national and international scales.

AB  - The Green Revolution exemplifies the capital-intensive modernization model of resource plunder and labor exploitation. This has provoked small-scale producers and civil society groups to counterpose an agroecology-based solidarity economy (EcoSol-agroecology), especially in Latin America. But their efforts encounter dominant models - of innovation, management, markets, nature, etc. - which limit alternatives. To clarify a transformative agenda, advocates have elaborated agroecological innovation through several complementary practices. Nature is framed as agri-biodiversity complementing socio-cultural diversity. Short food-supply chains (circuitos curtos) build consumer support for production methods enhancing producers' livelihoods, providing socio-economic equity and conserving natural resources. Through dialogos de saberes, i.e. knowledge exchange among farmers and with external experts, cultivation and water-management methods are designed or adapted as socio-environmental technologies. Capacities are built for collective self-management of those solidarity relationships. In such ways, agroecological innovation co-produces specific forms of nature, technoscientific knowledge and society; their practices construct a distinctive socionatural order. Such order arises through several instruments - making identities, institutions and discourses - as understood by STS co-production theory. Here this theory illuminates two Brazilian agroforestry initiatives whose cooperative practices seek to transform their own participants' lives and wider agri-food systems. By combining diverse sources, composite cultures deepen the social basis of territorial belonging.

AB  - Biochar research has focused in the last years in the use of wood or grass derived materials for carbon sequestration. However, manure derived biochar can provide other benefits after soil addition, including nutrient supply. At present, there is an incomplete understanding of pyrolysis on manures. In order to understand the benefits obtained after addition of these types of materials to the soil, an experiment involving the use of different manures and pyrolysis temperatures was performed. Five manure wastes were selected for this experiment: cattle manure (E); cattle manure mixed with straw (EP), chicken manure (G), chicken manure mixed with sawdust (GS) and pig slurry (PC). Unpyrolyzed samples were compared to biochars prepared at 300 and 500 degrees C. Relevant properties for agronomic purposes were determined, including pH, electrical conductivity, nutrient content, metal content, proximate analysis and carbon thermostability. Our results show that biochars tailored for different purposes can be prepared after a careful choice of feedstock and pyrolysis temperature. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of biofertilizer in crop production is gaining importance in modern agriculture, especially under stressful environments. In drought-hit areas of the world, improvement in drought tolerance of major food crops is one of the way forwards to ensure food security. Under water limited conditions, the use of ACC-deaminase biofertilizers can mitigate the adverse effects of drought stress on crop production. Present study was conducted for the field evaluation of ACC-deaminase based biofertilizer (Rhizobium and Pseudomonas strains) for improving chickpea productivity in Bahawalpur. Six field trials were conducted in different villages of Bahawalpur. Biofertilizer alone and in combination with enriched compost was evaluated under field conditions. Different treatments used in the experiment were control, P-Enriched compost, biofertilizer and P-Enriched compost + biofertilizer. The experiments were conducted in Randomized Complete Block Design with three replications. Results showed that enriched compost and biofertilizer, individually and in combination significantly improved the number of nodules plant(-1), nodules fresh weight and nodules dry weight of chickpea. The combined application of P-enriched compost and biofertilizer resulted in maximum increase in number of nodules plant(-1) and nodules dry weight as compared to control. The integrated use also gave better results in improving plant height and shoot dry weight, yield, number of pods plant(-1), number of grains pod(-1), and 1000 grain weight as compared to separate use of biofertilizer and P-enriched compost. A significant increase in nitrogen and phosphorus contents of chickpea was also observed with combined application of biofertilizer and compost. It can be concluded that the integrated use of ACC-deaminase containing biofertilizer and P-enriched compost is an effective biotechnology to improve chickpea productivity under field conditions and should be recommended to the farmers in the region, where water shortage is the main hindrance to agricultural sustainability.

AB  - Forested areas provide various services, including crucial carbon sequestration for climate change mitigation. The Madhupur Sal Forest (MSF) in Bangladesh was studied extensively for its ecosystem services and carbon sequestration potential. Research conducted from February to August 2023 in Gaira and Dokhola villages assessed local community benefits and biodiversity. Interviews with 50 respondents and analysis of 20 plots were conducted to study carbon sequestration in the MSF. Twenty identified ecosystem services range from fuel and wood to cultural and economic advantages. Eight tree species, totaling 401 trees, were identified, with Ficus hispida being the most effective in annual carbon sequestration. Shorea robusta showed less efficacy in carbon sequestration, resulting in a total forest capture of 12 004 657.8 pounds per year. The study highlights the MSF's significant contribution to global climate change mitigation. Emphasis is placed on the need for enhanced carbon sequestration through forest management, reforestation, and afforestation projects in deforested areas. Despite diverse ecosystem services, the MSF faces threats, necessitating collaborative conservation efforts, sustainable management practices, and community involvement for its vitality.

AB  - Community resilience, the capacity of a community to adapt to change in ways that result in positive impacts on its well-being, is increasingly used as a framework for understanding and enhancing the sustainability of forest-dependent communities as social ecological systems. However, studies linking community resilience to the implementation of forest management programs are limited. This study uses community resilience literature and analyzes data collected from interviews to study barriers of forest-dependent communities of collaborative forest management (CFM) in two forest-dependent communities in the Ashanti region of Ghana. Analysis revealed the barriers in community response to CFM programs in these two communities comprise institutional shortfalls in the design and implementation of the CFM program that have constrained the incentives, capacity and opportunities for communities to successfully adapt to the program. The paper offers recommendations on how the CFM program can contribute to building the resilience of communities in managing their forests. The first is to build institutional capacity of communities to play an active role in forest governance, and the second is the prioritization of well-being and livelihood enhancement as forest management goals.

AB  - Urban agriculture is vital for food security and environmental sustainability. The study evaluated peri-urban market gardening and the quality of shallow well water for irrigation purpose. The result shows a significant relationship between gender of farmers and occupation; education and income at p = .000. The mean value of bicarbonate, calcium and pH exceeded their detection level in about 66.7%, 60% and 53.3%, respectively. Kelly ratio ranged from 0.03 to 0.12 meq/L with a mean value above the computed KR in about 20%. Magnesium ratio, percent sodium exceeded the mean value in about 50% and 33.3% respectively in Ojo. Unlike Amuwo-Odofin, it is about 55.6% and 33.3%, respectively. The pattern of salinity and sodium hazard shows that approximately 66.7%, 26.7% and 6.7% of the shallow wells indicate low, medium and high salinity respectively. The paper recommended monitoring of irrigation water quality and runoff control. Regulation of agricultural activities and protective measures against pollution of water sources were also recommended.

AB  - Peasant farmers in the Manga Grasslands of semi-arid north-east Nigeria depend largely on agriculture for their livelihood. However, recurrent drought since the early 1970s has disrupted the traditional farming systems of the region, and hence the agriculture-based rural economy of the Grasslands. There is evidence that farmers in the Grasslands are obliged to intensify crop production in areas with 'good' soils and 'adequate' water supply, that is, the oases. The rich organic soils and the shallow, semi-confined water table beneath the oases are precious natural resources for intensive agriculture. These do not come without a price, however, as the rich, organic soils have the potential to be contaminated by acid sulphate and salt. It is expected that future soil creation, particularly under dry climatic conditions, will lead to the formation of true acid sulphate soils, and consequently, the twin processes of soil acidification and salinization will present real management problems for sustainable agriculture. It is concluded however, that under the prevailing soil, hydrological and climatic conditions of the oasis, sustainable agricultural production remains elusive.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to explore and evaluate the relationships and links between standard food production practices and the principles of sustainable production. As part of the study, several explanatory frameworks are explored and discussed. Interviews with industry experts and a survey covering more than 600 Malaysian SMEs producing halal foods were commissioned. The results provide indepth insights into sustainable food production practices. The findings of this study are intended to be used: (a) to assist an understanding of the synergies between standard production practices and sustainable production principles; (b) to clarify whether halal food production is capturing aspects of sustainable development; and (c) to identify opportunities for small and medium sized enterprises to venture into sustainable initiatives at minimal cost. Additionally, the investigation provides evidence that compliance with environmental standards can go hand in hand with the meeting of other sets of production standards. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study proposed applying artificial intelligence (AI) to predict the actual electrical conductivity (EC) of raw and pasteurized milk using moderate electric field (MEF) based on the electric field strength (EFS) and mass flow rate (MFR) along with modeling moisture content (MC) based on the EC. To this end, an artificial neural network (ANN) was implemented for conventionally (CP) and non-thermally (NP) pasteurized milk. The findings indicated no significant difference (p > 0.05) between the experimental and predicted data for EC and MC. The MFR and EFS affected the actual EC. The raw milk samples had an EC of 0.468812-0.46913 S/m and MC of 87.3218-87.35941%, while these values in NP pasteurized milk were 0.457441-0.638224 S/m and 87.33986-87.40851%. With correlation coefficients (R) of 0.736478106-0.951840323 and mean square errors (MSE) of 0.005539-0.0064, the ANN accurately predicted the raw and pasteurized milk MC based on the EC using the sixth-order polynomial model and the EC based on the EFS and MFR using a quadratic model. The EC of pasteurized milk by NP was significantly (p < 0.05) lower than that of CP and raw milk by 15.44% and 11.30%, respectively. The results show that the EFS and MFR might be used for the online assessment of milk's physical attributes (e.g., EC), followed by using the assessed parameter to determine other properties (e.g., MC) by developing AI approaches based on optimized models. These observations showcase the innovative use of ANN-based AI to predict milk's EC and MC accurately. Integrating such AI platforms into non-thermal food processing could eventually develop more sustainable food production and enhance food security and quality through process innovation and sustainable manufacturing, contributing to the industrial revolution and sustainable development goals.

AB  - In this article, we assess ecological, economic and social sustainability impacts of four alternative agricultural policy scenarios relevant to the European perspective. The analysed scenarios are: Prolonged Agenda 2000, On-going CAP reform, Integrated rural and environmental policy, and Liberalized Agricultural Trade. An economic agricultural sector model of Finnish agriculture is used in the evaluation of policy impacts up to 2020. Selected indicators representing the three dimensions of sustainability are calculated on the basis of the production variables of the model in each scenario. It is assumed that economic rationality, represented by the sector model, is a driving force directing agricultural production and land use, which, in turn, have a number of ecological, economic and social consequences. Our results show that a partial de-coupling of agricultural support from production and moderate reductions of commodity prices are likely to yield environmental benefits. In addition, there is a clear trade-off between environmental benefits and production volume and intensity. However, full de-coupling and radical price reductions are not likely to bring any additional environmental benefits but will result in a significant down-scaling and regional concentration of remaining agricultural activities. Hence the presented analysis is an interesting platform for discussion for stakeholders when implementing agricultural policy reforms.

AB  - Mountain regions play a crucial role in maintaining global biodiversity, with altitude exerting a significant influence on soil microbial diversity by altering plant diversity, soil nutrients, and microclimate. However, differences in microbial community composition between topsoil (0-10 cm deep) and subsoil (10-20 cm deep) remain poorly understood. Here, we aimed to assess soil microbial diversity, microbial network complexity, and microbial community assembly in the topsoil and subsoil layers of the dry-hot Jinsha River valley in southwestern China. Using high-throughput sequencing in soil samples collected along an altitudinal gradient, we found that bacterial diversity in topsoil decreased with increasing altitude, while bacterial diversity in subsoil showed no altitude-dependent changes. Fungal diversity in topsoil also varied with altitude, while subsoil fungal diversity showed no change. These findings suggest that microbial diversity in topsoil was more sensitive to changes in altitude than subsoil. Bacterial community assembly tended to be governed by stochastic processes, while fungal assembly was deterministic. Soil bacterial and fungal network complexity was enhanced with increasing altitude but reduced as diversity increased. Interestingly, the presence of woody plant species negatively affected bacterial and fungal community composition in both soil layers. Soil pH and water content also negatively affected microbial community composition, while organic carbon and total nitrogen positively influenced the microbial community composition. Simultaneously, herb and woody plant diversity mainly affected soil bacterial diversity in the topsoil and subsoil, respectively, while woody plant diversity mainly affected soil fungal diversity in subsoil and soil nutrients had more effect on soil fungal diversity. These findings suggest that altitude directly and indirectly affects microbial diversity in topsoil, subsequently influencing microbial diversity in subsoil through nutrient availability.

AB  - Sustainable soil carbon sequestration practices need to be rapidly scaled up and implemented to contribute to climate change mitigation. We highlight that the major potential for carbon sequestration is in cropland soils, especially those with large yield gaps and/or large historic soil organic carbon losses. The implementation of soil carbon sequestration measures requires a diverse set of options, each adapted to local soil conditions and management opportunities, and accounting for site-specific trade-offs. We propose the establishment of a soil information system containing localised information on soil group, degradation status, crop yield gap, and the associated carbon-sequestration potentials, as well as the provision of incentives and policies to translate management options into region- and soil-specific practices. Reducing soil degradation and improving soil management could make an important contribute to climate change mitigation. Here the authors discuss opportunities and challenges towards implementing a global climate mitigation strategy focused on carbon sequestration in agricultural soils, and propose a framework for guiding region- and soil-specific management options.

AB  - Purpose Mismanagement of supply chain operations may lead to waste of products and incur substantial monetary losses. This is particularly true for products with attributes that hasten deterioration, e.g. time, temperature, humidity and barometric pressure. Attribute-sensitive products must be carefully monitored throughout all supply chain processes to ensure acceptable quality to the end customers. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the scientific literature on attribute sensitive products and on attribute sensitive supply chains. The collected studies were reviewed using the content analysis method, focusing on the following aspects of attribute sensitive products: (1) industries; (2) product categories; (3) decisions involved; (4) processes; (5) current issues; (6) sustainability concerns; (7) research methods used; (8) objectives of decision makers; (9) solution approaches used; (10) incentives driving management and (11) future research issues. Based on the analysis of findings, gaps are identified, and future research directions are proposed. Design/methodology/approach Literature review and content analysis. Findings The authors discovered that, while the importance of product attributes vary from one industry to the other, overall the time attribute was critical in all of the industries considered in this literature review. Coordination, customer satisfaction, reliability and safety were key issues in attribute sensitive product supply chains (asp-SCs). Similar to the typical supply chains, asp-SCs face economic, social and environmental sustainability issues. However, the majority of the studies in our analysis emphasized importance of the social sustainability. The majority of the papers were reviewed and analyzed and adopted the modeling approach as a research method. Furthermore, it was found that asp-SCs were mostly driven with customer demands and social pressure. Research limitations/implications Based on the literature review and content analysis, there are a number of directions for the work conducted in this study to be extended in several directions. First, the literature search could be expanded by relaxing some of the restrictions (e.g. include the conference papers and articles from on-line business journals). Second, additional scientific publishers can be considered (e.g. Emerald Insight-; Inderscience-). The latter two extensions would allow a more precise assessment of published to date work on asp-SC operations. Third, our findings could be validated based on interviews with professionals and executives from companies dealing with asp-SCs. Such validation will allow identification of the differences between the state of the art and the state of practice. Practical implications Supply chains that handle attribute sensitive products (asps) must consider the complexity of products that significantly change their properties due to factors such as time, temperature, barometric pressure, humidity. Mismanagement of operations within such supply chains may lead to significant product waste, as well as substantial monetary losses. Originality/value This study presented a comprehensive literature review and content analysis of studies dealing with asps in the following industries: fashion, food, healthcare, humanitarian and pharmaceutical industries

AB  - This research aimed to develop an advanced model for sustainably reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the future. The research employs a quantitative research approach, introducing a new model called the Structural Equation Modeling with Vector Autoregressive Latent Trajectory Model (SEM-VALTM). This model differs significantly from previous models as it identifies strategic pathways for effective national administration, ensuring high performance without spurious results, surpassing the efficiency of earlier models. The findings reveal that the environmental sector is directly affected by the economic sector, with the relationship exhibiting an inverse direction. Similarly, the environmental sector is influenced by the social sector, also in an opposing direction. The SEM-VALTM model contributes new knowledge, highlighting that the environmental sector demonstrates the slowest adjustment toward equilibrium (6%). Under a sustainability policy framework, it was found that the economic sector, particularly the industrial rate, has the highest influence on economic changes, which in turn have the most significant negative impact on the environment. The study further projects that from 2025 to 2037, greenhouse gas emissions will rise sharply, reaching 95.05 Mt CO2 Eq., exceeding the carrying capacity threshold of 60.5 Mt CO2 Eq. Based on risk management principles, continuous measures must be implemented to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, the government must establish a new scenario policy emphasizing renewable energy and clean technologies as substitutes. The findings suggest that future energy consumption will consistently decrease, resulting in greenhouse gas emissions of 50.04 Mt CO2 Eq. (2025-2037), which is below the carrying capacity.

AB  - This paper assesses the environmental impacts of the average American's diet and food loss and waste (FLW) habits through an analysis of energy, water, land, and fertilizer requirements (inputs) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (outputs). We synthesized existing datasets to determine the ramifications of the typical American adult's food habits, as well as the environmental impact associated with shifting diets to meet the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) dietary guideline recommendations. In 2010, FLW accounted for 35% of energy use, 34% of blue water use, 34% of GHG emissions, 31% of land use, and 35% of fertilizer use related to an individual's food-related resource consumption, i.e. their foodprint. A shift in consumption towards a healthier diet, combined with meeting the USDA and Environmental Protection Agency's 2030 food loss and waste reduction goal could increase per capita food related energy use 12%, decrease blue water consumption 4%, decrease green water use 23%, decrease GHG emissions from food production 11%, decrease GHG emissions from landfills 20%, decrease land use 32%, and increase fertilizer use 12%.

AB  - Forestry has been proposed as a means to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions, by either reducing sources or enhancing sinks. This study assesses the potential of an incentive-based program to stimulate small farmers and communities to adopt biomass accumulating measures such as agroforestry or improved forest management. Current vegetation type, land use and stocks of carbon were assessed for an area of around 600 000 ha in southern Mexico, and the carbon (C) sequestration potential of a number of alternative techniques, based on farmers' preferences, was estimated. Cost and benefit flows in US $ per Megagram (= 10(6) g) of carbon (MgC) of each current and alternative system were developed. A model was designed to calculate the expected response to financial incentives of between US SO and $40 per MgC sequestered. The most cost-effective method for sequestering carbon appears to be the improved management of natural forest on communal lands. We estimated that 38 x 10(6) MgC could be sequestered for under US $15 MgC-1, of which 32 x 10(6) MgC through forest management. The choice of a baseline rate of biomass loss under a 'business-as-usual' scenario remains a critical issue for estimates of the cost-effectiveness of carbon sequestration by forestry.

AB  - Kelp farming is increasing along the temperate coastlines of the Americas and Europe. The economic, ecological, and social frameworks surrounding kelp farming in these new areas are in contrast with the conditions of progenitor kelp farming regions in China, Japan, and Korea. Thus, identifying and addressing the environmental and social impacts of kelp farming in these regions is vital to ensuring the industry's long-term sustainability. Here, a conceptual model of the human and natural systems supporting this nascent kelp aquaculture sector was developed using Maine, USA as a focal region. Potential negative impacts of kelp aquaculture were identified to be habitat degradation, overfishing of wild seeds, predation and competition with wild fish and genes, and transmission of diseases. Increased food security, improved restoration efforts, greater fisheries productivity, and alternative livelihoods development were determined to be potential positive impacts of kelp aquaculture. Changes in biodiversity and productivity resulting from either negative or positive impacts of kelp aquaculture were confirmed to have downstream effects on local fisheries and coastal communities. Recommendations to improve or protect the ecosystem services tangential to kelp farming include: define ecosystem and management boundaries, assess ecosystem services and environmental carrying capacity, pursue ecologically and socially considerate engineering, and protect the health and genetic diversity of wild kelp beds. Recommendations to ensure that kelp farming improves the well-being of all stakeholders include: increase horizontal expansion, expand and teach Best Management Practices, and develop climate change resiliency. Additionally, an integrated management strategy should be developed for wild and farmed kelp to ensure that kelp aquaculture is developed in the context of other sectors and goals.

AB  - In this study, we employ a Moran's i based Lasso (Mi-Lasso) methodology to address the spatial dependence of an unspecified functional form, investigating the association between a country's economic growth and the rate of deforestation. Our aim is to explore the existence of a forestry environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). Our approach to handling spatial dependence overcomes limitations identified in existing EKC literature. We estimate a series of cross-sectional data models spanning the period from 1990 to 2020 for 146 countries. Our findings indicate a non-linear relationship, revealing a change peak rate of deforestation over time. Additionally, we observe that the income threshold at which the deforestation rate begins to decrease changes over time with differences observed between model specifications. Crucially, our results highlight that failing to account for spatial dependence leads to a significant absolute upward bias in ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates of income and worse model fit.

The literature review involves both direct and indirect policy measures that ensure food security in developing countries. These policies involve direct interventions involving structural changes in relative prices and targeted food subsidies, and indirect measures such as improving agricultural infrastructure, the general economic environment, and providing farmers with new farm technologies to increase food production. The manuscript shows the efforts several food security policy researchers have put to examine policy options and their impacts on food security. (C) 2016 Journal of Innovation & Knowledge.

AB  - Water, energy, and food security are the three most critical elements for achieving the 2030 United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. While much effort has been focused on the development of interfacial solar evaporation technology for seawater desalination, limited effort has been directed towards potential sustainable agricultural applications. This work addresses this gap by developing a self-sustaining and solar-driven offshore double-layered sea farm system to address growing global shortages in clean water, agricultural land resources and food supply. During a long-term field test, this unique design was used to successfully germinate and grow, with a survival rate of 80%, three common vegetable crops (broccoli, lettuce, and Pak Choi) on seawater surfaces without maintenance nor additional clean water irrigation. Thus, this design could potentially make a significant contribution to sustainable agriculture production in the seawater-energy-food nexus.

AB  - Slow-release formulations have been developed to enhance the effective use of active ingredients. In the case of fertilizers the formulations reduce nutrient leaching and greenhouse gas emissions. While polymer-coating is the dominant technology in producing slow-release fertilizers there is a demand for alternative options for different usages. To this end, a commercially available organoclay, with a basal spacing of 3.67 nm, was used as matrix to produce pellets of CuSO4 and dicyandiamide (DCD) of different sizes by a die set and hand press. Both CuSO4 and DCD pellets showed a good slow-release performance in dissolution tests. Large pellets (1.2 cm in diameter) of CuSO4 had a better performance in slow-release than small ones (0.7 cm). For DCD pellets (0.7 cm in diameter) it took 6 days for a complete dissolution. The slow-release effect is probably due to the hydrophobic nature and high aspect ratio of the organoclay. The former makes soluble compounds between organoclay particles less susceptible to dissolution in water, whereas the latter hinders the dissolution of solutes inside a pellet by making their diffusion passage tortuous. The organoclay formulation is easy to make, and the rate of solute release can be adjusted by changing pellet size. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The livestock sector is vulnerable to climate change and related policy in two ways. First, livestock production and performance are directly impacted by climate with many projected effects being negative. Second, the sector may need to alter operations to limit the effects of climate change through adaptation and mitigation. Potential adaptation strategies involve land use decisions, animal feeding changes, genetic manipulation and alterations in species and/or breeds. In terms of mitigation, livestock is a substantial contributor to global non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions. Mitigation opportunities involve altered land use for grazing and feed production, feeding practices, manure treatment and herd size reduction. In addition, strengthening institutions that promote markets and trade, as well as local support programs can help both mitigation and adaptation. Previous literature has summarized the options available to individual producers. This overview extends the literature by including sector-level response as well as the relationships between adaptation and mitigation activities.

AB  - Since the last four decades, groundwater irrigation has played a critical role in improving crop production and rural livelihoods. However, the flawed policies have allowed farmers to install private tube wells relentlessly, resulting in a slew of water quality and environmental issues. This study aims to investigate the key trends in temporal development of groundwater irrigation and its consequences in Pakistan. The dataset, which spanned 38 years (1981 to 2018), included variables such as the number of tube wells, wheat area and production, farm size, total cultivated area, and total irrigated area in Punjab province. Our results show that, while the number of government-installed tube wells has decreased over time, the number of private tube wells has increased by 579% since 1981. About 85% of these privately owned tube wells are diesel tube wells, while the remaining 15% are electric tube wells. The ARDL regression results show that groundwater development, as a result of growth in private tube wells, has significantly aided wheat production in both the short and long run. However, the results of ARIMA model show that, in the absence of any regulatory mechanism to limit private tube well growth, the number of private tube wells in Punjab will increase by 43% over the next two decades, potentially jeopardizing the country's groundwater sustainability and food security. To ensure the sustainability of groundwater use, farmers' incomes, and the food security of the population, there is an urgent need to devise policy options to limit the growth of probate tube wells in the province. In addition, the new regulations should consider the equity implications and the economic shock to poor farms and households.

AB  - . 1.Arthropods, a major component of functional biodiversity within agro-ecosystems, contribute to sustainability through processes including nutrient cycling and pest control. Extensively managed field margins can help protect this functional biodiversity by providing habitat for beneficial species. 2.This 2year study investigated the relative benefits of grassland field margin treatments (Fenced only, Rotavated, and Reseeded (with a grass and wildflower mixture)) on the abundance and taxon richness of five arthropod trophic groups (detritivores, herbivores, predators, parasitoids and hyperparasitoids) from the orders Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera and Araneae. 3.The taxon richness and abundance of all trophic groups (with the exception of herbivore abundance) was greater in fenced field margin treatments than in the adjacent grazed field, particularly by the final sampling occasion. However, there were seasonal differences, with abundance and taxon richness generally greater in August than in June. Only detritivores and herbivores responded to the individual fenced field margin treatments. The botanically more species rich, rotavated and reseeded treatments, had greater detritivore and herbivore richness and abundance than the fenced only treatments. 4.Community structure analysis indicated that the grazed (within) field and fenced field margins had two distinct communities for all trophic groups, demonstrating the conservation value of the margins within intensively managed agricultural grasslands. 5.The current Irish agri-environment scheme requires fencing of field margins. Our results highlight how this relatively simple measure can benefit arthropod conservation and functional biodiversity. This may in turn benefit farm productivity through potentially improved nutrient cycling and natural pest control.

AB  - In this study, broccoli grown with deep sea water minerals (DSWMs) confirmed anticancer effects in HT-29 colorectal cancer cells and anti-inflammatory effects in C57BL/6 mouse splenocytes. Natural dream cultured broccoli (NB) grown with DSWMs had elevated sodium (Na) and calcium (Ca) levels and enhanced the expression of p53 and p21, both of which are associated with cell cycle arrest in HT-29 colorectal cancer cells. It also decreased the expression of Bax, Bad, Bim, Bak, caspase-9, and caspase-3. In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated C57BL/6 mouse splenocytes, NB produced little nitric oxide (NO). ELISA research indicated that NB decreased IL-1 & beta;, IL-6, TNF-& alpha;, IFN-& gamma;, and IL-12 expression while increasing NK cell activity. As a result, broccoli cultivated with deep water minerals has better anticancer and anti-inflammatory properties than conventional and organic farming.

AB  - Greenhouse gas emissions from Ethiopian agriculture are significantly increasing, with the largest share is from enteric fermentation and manure left on pasture. An investigation was conducted to evaluate the anti-nutrient composition and effect of commonly used medicinal plant extracts on enteric methane emission from fibrous feeds using maize stover as substrate feed. Total phenols, flavonoid, tannin and essential oil contents were analyzed using established standards. Effects of leaf extracts of Acacia nilotica, Azadirachta indica, three varieties of Cymbopogon citratus (Cymbopogon citratus-I, Cymbopogon citratus java and Cymbopogon citratus upper awash), Leucaena leucocephala, Moringa stenopetala, three varieties of Rosmarinus officinalis (Rosmarinus officinalis I, Rosmarinus officinalis II and Rosmarinus officinalis III) and Thyme schimperi, seed of three Coriandrum sativum varieties (Coriandrum sativum Batu, Coriandrum sativum Tulu and Coriandrum sativum Waltai) and root of Echinops kebericho on total gas production, digestibility and methane production of maize stover were investigated at different doses using the standard procedures. The results indicated that leaf extracts of Acacia nilotica had the highest (P < 0.001) total phenolic and total tannin contents. Compared to other evaluated plant species, all varieties of Cymbopogon citratus had the highest (P < 0.001) flavonoid content. Significantly high (P < 0.001) essential oil content was observed in Rosmarinus officinalis II than other varieties of Rosmarinus officinalis and other plant species. Significant reduction (P < 0.001) of methane production was observed with extracts of Cymbopoon citratus java (22.5 % less methane than the control) and thyme schimperi (16.7 % less methane than the control) at dose of 50 mg/kg DM. There was also significant (P < 0.001) interaction effect between plant species and dose rates at 50 mg/kg DM for both plant species. It can be concluded that the use of 50 mg/kg DM of Cymbopoon citratus java and Thyme schimperi extract to maize stover reduced methane production without negatively affecting feed digestibility. Further studies are necessary to examine the storability of the extracts in different time durations and evaluate their effects in vivo with animals.

AB  - In 2015, the United Nations challenged the scientific community to evaluate development pathways consistent with the goal of limiting global average temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C. This study reports analysis that was carried out as part of a project responding to that challenge. Using recently developed methods for regional integrated assessment of agricultural systems, this study evaluates the economic and environmental performance of dryland farming systems in the United States of America (U.S). Pacific Northwest, a major wheat (Triticum aestivum) production region, under greenhouse gas mitigation and policy scenarios consistent with the 1.5 degrees C goal. A novel feature of this study is to combine bio-physical and economic models with site-specific life cycle analysis to evaluate both the economic performance of current and possible alternative farming systems. The analysis shows that these farming systems could be adapted through changes in management to reduce soil emissions of greenhouse gases and incorporation of new biofuel crops, and could be affected by changes in prices and costs of production associated with greenhouse gas mitigation policies. These changes could result in a win-win outcome for those farms in the Pacific Northwest region where site-specific conditions are suited to these adaptations, providing both higher farm incomes and contributing to greenhouse gas emissions reductions. A key implication for mitigation and adaptation strategies is the need to coordinate climate policy design and development of technologies needed to achieve policy goals.

AB  - The increasing rate of urbanization along with its socio-environmental impact are major global challenges. Therefore, there is a need to assess the boundaries to growth for the future development of cities by the inclusion of the assessment of the environmental carrying capacity (ECC) into spatial management. The purpose is to assess the resource dependence of a given entity. ECC is usually assessed based on indicators such as the ecological footprint (EF) and biocapacity (BC). EF is a measure of the biologically productive areas demanded by human consumption and waste production. Such areas include the space needed for regenerating food and fibers as well as sequestering the generated pollution, particularly CO2 from the combustion of fossil fuels. BC reflects the biological regeneration potential of a given area to regenerate resources as well to absorb waste. The city level EF assessment has been applied to urban zones across the world, however, there is a noticeable lack of urban EF assessments in Central Eastern Europe. Therefore, the current research is a first estimate of the EF and BC for the city of Wroclaw, Poland. This study estimates the Ecological Footprint of Food (EFF) through both a top-down assessment and a hybrid top-down/bottom-up assessment. Thus, this research verifies also if results from hybrid method could be comparable with top-down approach. The bottom-up component of the hybrid analysis calculated the carbon footprint of food using the life cycle assessment (LCA) method. The top-down result of Wroclaw's EFF were 1% greater than the hybrid EFF result, 0.974 and 0.963 gha per person respectively. The result indicated that the EFF exceeded the BC of the city of Wroclaw 10-fold. Such assessment support efforts to increase resource efficiency and decrease the risk associated with resources-including food security. Therefore, there is a need to verify if a city is able to satisfy the resource needs of its inhabitants while maintaining the natural capital on which they depend intact.

AB  - Agricultural land use in suburban Beijing has changed dramatically in the last decade. This paper utilised unique, county-level spatial inventory datasets of land use in 1993 and 2004 to better quantify spatial configuration changes of main agricultural land-use types in the suburban counties of Beijing. A revised centroid model was applied to explicitly capture, analyse and visualise centroidal coordinates of land-use types in six typical suburban counties (samples) by geographic information system (GIS). Obvious displacements of corresponding centroids of agricultural land-use types in the samples demonstrates that configurations of agricultural land use have been destroyed in different parts of suburban Beijing. Furthermore, some typical patterns are explored according to the direction of displacement, which is driven mainly by urbanisation, topography, economic development and land-use policies. Land-use policies are shown to play more direct roles in spatial configuration changes of agricultural land use than other factors. It can be concluded that agricultural land-use configuration in suburban Beijing is affected by land resource balance among economic development, grain production and ecological protection.

AB  - The main goal of the article is to compare three approaches to measuring environmental sustainability in agriculture: i) the environmental burden index; ii) the sustainable value of eco-efficient production; and iii) the sustainable value of the eco-effective farm, applied to the sample of 130 EUFADN (European Union Farm Accountancy Data Network) regions in 2015. The study indicates a fundamental problem: the notion of environmental sustainability in agriculture differs depending on the criterion we apply. We recognized a principle trade-off in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) which consists of compensating for the strain on the natural environment with production or with public goods provision. Studies on these two effects seem to be crucial to draw a consistent development path for the CAP. Our major finding is that public goods-oriented farming is more likely to expand after improving eco-efficiency. This is still a challenge because in European regions, eco-efficient has not meant environmentally sustainable yet.

AB  - Like many other tropical countries, the Philippines has suffered from decades of deforestation and forest degradation during and even after the logging era. Several open access Earth Observation (EO) products are increasingly being used for deforestation analysis in support of national and international initiatives and policymaking on forest conservation and management. Using a combination of annual forest loss and near-real time forest disturbance products, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the deforestation events in three forest frontiers of the Philippines. A space-time pattern mining approach was used to map quarterly deforestation hotspots at 1 km pixel size (100 hectares), where hotspots are classified according to the spatial and temporal variability of the 2000-2020 deforestation in the study area. Our results revealed that 79-81% of the hotspots overlap with primary forests and 27-29% are inside the state-declared protected areas. The intra-annual analysis of deforestation in 2020 revealed an alarming trend, where most deforestation occurred between the 1st and 2nd quarter (92-94% in hotspot forests; 87-89% in non-hotspot forests), highly overlapping within the slash-and-burn farming season. We also found "new" hotspots (2020) formed mostly from landslide scars and partly from selective logging, the latter is believed to be underestimated. Our study paves the way for rapid and regular assessment of the country's deforestation, useful for the respective environmental institutions who convene several times a year. Moreover, our findings assert the imperative of alternative livelihoods to upland farmers, efficient forest protection activities, and even the mitigation of landslide risks.

AB  - Studies of forest fragmentation in the tropics have systematically paid more attention to understanding processes contributing to the formation of landscapes that are the product of deforestation, while little or no attention has been paid to forested landscapes that are the product of secondary growth processes. In this paper, using information of forest cover from 1960 to 2000 derived from aerial photography and remote sensing data, we examine the dynamics associated with deforestation and secondary growth processes at the Chorotega region, Costa Rica. Our analysis is conducted using a comprehensive land capability map developed for the country. Our results indicate the occurrence of two well-defined land cover change processes over time. Extensive/intensive cattle ranching practices that contribute to significant forest degradation and forest cover loss characterize the first of these processes, occur-ring between 1960 and 1980. The second period (1980-2000) is characterized by a dynamic process of secondary forest growth resulting from a combination of internal and international market forces and conservation initiatives. Conclusions from this paper indicate that more attention needs to be paid to tropical secondary landscapes that are recuperating from years of constant degradation. This natural recovery process could be beneficial for biodiversity recovery, biological corridors and environmental services. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to simulate food web responses of small boreal lakes to changes in thermal stratification due to global warming, a 4 year whole-lake manipulation experiment was performed. Within that time, period lake mixing was intensified artificially during two successive summers. Complementary data from a nearby lake of similar size and basic water chemistry were used as a reference. Phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll a did not respond to the greater mixing depth but an increase was observed in the proportional abundance of diatoms, and the proportional abundance of cryptophytes also increased immediately after the onset of mixing. Obligate anoxic green sulphur bacteria vanished at the onset of mixing but gradually recovered after re-establishment of hypolimnetic anoxic conditions. No major effect on crustacean zooplankton was found, but their diversity increased in the metalimnion. During the mixing, the density of rotifers declined but protozoan density increased in the hypolimnion. Littoral benthic invertebrate density increased during the mixing due to Ephemeroptera, Asellus aquaticus and Chironomidae, whereas the density of Chaoborus larvae declined during mixing and lower densities were still recorded one year after the treatment. No structural changes in fish community were found although gillnet catches increased after the onset of the study. The early growth of perch (Perca fluviatilis) increased compared to the years before the mixing and in comparison to the reference lake, suggesting improved food availability in the experimental lake. Although several food web responses to the greater mixing depth were found, their persistence and ecological significance were strongly dependent on the extent of the disturbance. To better understand the impacts of wind stress on small lakes, long term whole-lake experiments are needed.

AB  - Nationwide and consistent information on agricultural land use forms an important basis for sustainable land management maintaining food security, (agro)biodiversity, and soil fertility, especially as German agriculture has shown high vulnerability to climate change. Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data of the Copernicus program offer time series with temporal, spatial, radiometric, and spectral characteristics that have great potential for mapping and monitoring agricultural crops. This paper presents an approach which synergistically uses these multispectral and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) time series for the classification of 17 crop classes at 10 m spatial resolution for Germany in the year 2018. Input data for the Random Forest (RF) classification are monthly statistics of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time series. This approach reduces the amount of input data and pre-processing steps while retaining phenological information, which is crucial for crop type discrimination. For training and validation, Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) data were available covering 15 of the 16 German Federal States. An overall map accuracy of 75.5% was achieved, with class-specific F1-scores above 80% for winter wheat, maize, sugar beet, and rapeseed. By combining optical and SAR data, overall accuracies could be increased by 6% and 9%, respectively, compared to single sensor approaches. While no increase in overall accuracy could be achieved by stratifying the classification in natural landscape regions, the class-wise accuracies for all but the cereal classes could be improved, on average, by 7%. In comparison to census data, the crop areas could be approximated well with, on average, only 1% of deviation in class-specific acreages. Using this streamlined approach, similar accuracies for the most widespread crop types as well as for smaller permanent crop classes were reached as in other Germany-wide crop type studies, indicating its potential for repeated nationwide crop type mapping.

AB  - The majority of deforested land in the Amazon Basin has become cattle pasture, making forest-to-pasture conversion an important contributor to the carbon (C) and climate dynamics of the region. However, our understanding of biogeochemical dynamics in pasturelands remains poor, especially when attempting to scale up predictions of C cycle changes. A wide range of pasture ages, soil types, management strategies, and climates make remote sensing the only realistic means to regionalize our understanding of pasture biogeochemistry and C cycling over such an enormous geographic area. However, the use of remote sensing has been impeded by a lack of effective links between variables that can be observed from satellites (e.g. live and senescent biomass) and variables that cannot be observed, but which may drive key changes in C storage and trace gas fluxes (e.g. soil nutrient status). We studied patterns in canopy biophysical-biochemical properties and soil biogeochemical processes along pasture age gradients on two important soil types in the central Amazon. Our goals were to (1) improve our understanding of the plot-scale biogeochemical dynamics of this land-use change, (2) evaluate the effects of pasture development on two contrasting soil types (clayey Oxisols and sandy Entisols), and (3) attempt to use remotely sensed variables to scale up the site-specific variability in biogeochemical conditions of pasturelands. The biogeochemical analyses showed that (1) aboveground and soil C stocks decreased with pasture age on both clayey and sandy soils, (2) declines in plant biomass were well correlated with declines in soil C and with available phosphorus (P) and calcium (Ca), and (3) despite low initial values for total and available soil P, ecosystem P stocks declined further with pasture age, as did a number of other nutrients. Spectral mixture analysis of Landsat imagery provided estimates of photosynthetic vegetation (PV) and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) that were highly correlated with field measurements of these variables and plant biomass. In turn, the remotely sensed sum PV+NPV was well correlated with the changes in soil organic carbon and nitrogen, and available P and Ca. These results suggest that remote sensing can be an excellent indicator of not only pasture area, but of pasture condition and C storage, thereby greatly improving regional estimates of the environmental consequences of such land-use change.

AB  - The drying technology, a selective removal from a product of a great part of costitutional water, can be considered the oldest procedure of food preservation. In the past, dried foods were mainly considered alimentary reserves, but these products lately canged their function; in fact actually they are above all appreciated for their convenience and versatility. Dried fruit, in particular as semi-manifactured product, shall be able to assume still more importance in industrial production; in addition it could substitute other fruit derivatives traditionally used. In order to obtain this result it is necessary to improve the quality of industrial dried fruit. In this review some technological innovations of processess, plants and products are discussed.

AB  - Understanding how climate policies impact forest carbon sequestration is crucial for optimizing mitigation strategies. This study evaluated forest carbon sequestration in China from 2020 to 2060 under three climate scenarios: SSP1-2.6 (high mitigation), SSP3-7.0 (limited mitigation), and SSP5-8.5 (no mitigation). We integrated the land-use harmonization (LUH2) and patch-generating land-use simulation (PLUS) models to project forest cover change, and the Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed land (LPJmL) model to simulate carbon dynamics. The results showed stronger mitigation efforts led to higher sequestration, with annual rates of 0.49, 0.48, and 0.20 Pg yr-1 across the scenarios. SSP1-2.6 achieved the highest carbon density (17.75 kg m-2) and sequestration (56.95 Pg), driven by the greatest increases in the carbon density of existing forests (+41.56%) and soil carbon (+39.94%). SSP3-7.0, despite the highest forest cover (34.74%), had a lower carbon density (17.19 kg m-2) and sequestration (56.84 Pg). SSP5-8.5 recorded the lowest forest cover (27.12%) and sequestration (45.62 Pg). Increasing carbon density, rather than expanding forest area, could be more effective for carbon sequestration in China. The carbon density and annual sequestration in existing forests were 2.36 and 2.89 times higher than in new forests. We recommend prioritizing SSP1-2.6 to maximize sequestration, focusing on protecting southwest forests and soil carbon.

AB  - Groundwater resources in arid regions are crucial for water and food security and the maintenance of ecosystem services but face significant challenges from overexploitation and contamination, exacerbated by climate change. In Qatar, understanding the spatial variability of groundwater quality and its suitability for use remains limited. This study examines groundwater quality across the peninsula and evaluates its suitability for drinking and irrigation employing comprehensive Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques and water quality assessments. Twelve physicochemical parameters were analyzed to evaluate groundwater quality and determine the hydrogeochemical facies. Geospatial analysis was employed to visualize and quantify spatial correlations between groundwater salinity and geology, rainfall, distance to sea, land use, and abstraction and recharge activities. Suitability for use was assessed using the drinking water quality index (DWQI) and a novel integrated irrigation water quality index (IWQI), constructed upon seven standard indices. Results revealed predominantly high salinity in coastal and southern parts, suggesting extensive saltwater intrusion. Spatial correlations showed combined environmental and anthropogenic influences on groundwater salinity. Recharge efforts positively influenced groundwater quality, highlighting their effectiveness. The DWQI showed excellent to good drinking suitability over 1053.3 km2 (9.1%) of the study area. The IWQI indicated high to very high irrigation suitability over 3611 km2 (31.1%), concentrated in the north-central region. These findings highlight the critical importance of groundwater quality indicators for effective monitoring and underscore the need for integrated groundwater management strategies. This study offers practical guidance for local water resource managers, policymakers, and communities while also contributing to global climate adaptation strategies.

AB  - Climate change alters the impact of the environment on economies, and sustainable adaptation which may improve food security is embedded in the actualization of the 2030 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2, 13, and 14. Hence, this study contributes to the debate by measuring how farmers in the Northwestern region of Bangladesh adapt to climate change. A cross-sectional multistage random sampling is used to collect 500 data points by the face-to-face interview method. For robustness, the study demonstrates climate change adaptations, adaptation indices, and the sustainability indicators in social, economic, and environmental concepts using the composite indicator method. Also, Rasch analysis and marginal contribution were used to explain the adaptation indices. Finally, a trivariate Tobit regression is used to examine sustainability analyses of climate change adaptation strategies and explain how the climate change adaptations affect different dimensions of sustainability. The results showed that dominant male households, extended family, skilled farmers and food security influenced adaptation index as well as adaptation strategies like organic manure, changing planting dates, diseases tolerant varieties and irrigation. Though, most dominant strategies like irrigation and applying fertilizer are not sustainable. The study also found that farm size, credit access, and extension contact significantly affects sustainability. Moreover, off-farm activities, crop diversification, and using high-yield varieties are more sustainable adaptation strategies. Policy should be implemented on the basis of region and sustainable manner.

AB  - The production of biofuels in Sweden has increased significantly in the past years in order to reduce fossil fuel dependence and mitigate climate impacts. Nonetheless, current methodological guidelines for assessing the GHG savings from the use of biofuels do not fully account for benefits from by-products and other utilities (e.g. waste heat and electricity) from biofuel production. This study therefore reviews the aggregated environmental performance of these multi-functional biofuel systems by assessing impacts and benefits from relevant production processes in Sweden in order to improve the decision base for biofuel producers and policymakers in the transition to a bio-based and circular economy. This was done by (1) conducting a mapping of the Swedish biofuel production portfolio, (2) developing future production scenarios, and (3) application of life cycle assessment methodology to assess the environmental performance of the production processes. Special focus was provided to review the potential benefits from replacing conventional products and services with by-products and utilities. The results provide evidence that failure to account for non-fuel-related benefits from biofuel production leads to an underestimation of the contribution of biofuels to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts when replacing fossil fuels, showing the importance of their multi-functionality.

AB  - The increase of renewable energy production worldwide, occurred in the last years, is also attributable to some agroforestry species cultivated according to the short rotation coppice technique. Although these species are able of enhancing abandoned or marginal land leading to numerous environmental benefits, an increasing number of farmers are introducing them in place of agricultural crops. Therefore, since for a farmer economic sustainability is one of the main factors to introduce a biomass crop, the study aimed at evaluating the profitability of Paulownia, a species that has been spreading in recent years. In particular, an economic analysis has been carried out in a Southern Italian farm in which Paulownia has recently replaced a vineyard, by adopting a discounted cash flow approach. The results show that the Paulownia for both timber and woodchip production, with an annual gross margin equal to 357.91 euro ha(-1), can represent a valid alternative compared to wine grape (237.41 euro ha(-1)), while Paulownia for exclusively biomass production has almost zero profitability (4.22 euro ha(-1)). However, the profitability depends not only on the product typology but also on the future market price fluctuations, on the subsidies or incentives, as well as on adequate choices by entrepreneurs for the creation of sustainable supply chains also from an environmental and social point of view.

AB  - Available estimates of the land use changes and greenhouse gas emissions of biofuels fer significantly across economic models. This paper focuses on the impacts of price-induced yield assumptions on U.S. corn ethanol results. These assumptions have dramatic impacts within the FAPRI modeling framework, but limited ones within the GTAP-BIO model. I show that these sensitivity to yield assumption results are not comparable because the ex ante land and production elasticities assumed in these two models are not comparable. The analysis reveals that the current focus solely on the value of the price-induced yield elasticity can be misleading.

AB  - World agricultural production has seen significant growth in the past four decades, yet malnutrition remains a persistent problem, particularly in the global south and more so in the rural areas. Need for a holistic approach to food systems is becoming crucial in designing policies that support the transition to sustainable and healthy diets. The present study is aimed to understand the rural food environment in the Telangana state in southern India by analyzing the combination of external and personal factors affecting food choices, attitudes, and consumption behavior. We developed a scoring-based methodology to assess the external and personal domains and di-mensions to understand the food environment. The results showed that rural households favored carbohydrate-rich food groups obtained mostly from their own production or subsidized sources. On the other hand, protein and micronutrient-rich food groups were neglected due to affordability and preference for taste, cultural factors, and the limitations of external food environment. The findings of this study provide a deeper understanding of the food environment in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) conext. By highlighting the interplay between agriculture, food environments, and nutrition outcomes, this study contributes to the ongoing effort to address the global malnutrition crisis and support the development of healthier and more sustainable food systems. These findings can be useful to guide policy actions towards achieving food security and nutrition in the rural regions where food environments are under rapid transitions in the LMICs.

AB  - Bioenergy from cassava is a promising alternative energy source for both energy supply and the mitigation of greenhouse gases. However, major global trends, such as climate change and competing landuse patterns, pose substantial risks to the sustainable development of bioenergy. The main purpose of this study was to assess the sustainable development of bioenergy from cassava, considering landuse change and climate change with a biogeochemical process model within the "water-energy-food" nexus framework. The results showed that the land resources that were suitable for the development of cassava bioenergy have continuously decreased in China since 1990. At the same time, the climate has also undergone significant changes, with temperature showing an increasing trend, and precipitation showing a decreasing trend. With the influences of both landuse change and climate change, the total bioenergy of cassava showed a downward trend. In China, the potential bioenergy production for the year 1990, 2000, and 2010 was 6075 PJ, 5974 PJ, and 4399 PJ, respectively. Compared to 1990, the bioenergy production in 2010 decreased by 1676.40 million GJ, which equals 57 million tons of standard coal. In addition, the water footprint of bioenergy from cassava was discussed. After considering changes to landuse, climate, and water footprint, it was concluded that Guangxi was the most suitable place to develop cassava bioenergy, followed by Fujian, Guangdong, and Yunnan.

AB  - The Saranda forest region, which is well known for its biodiversity in India, is now confronted by rapid socioeconomic development, particularly the hilltop mining activities. Hilltop mining areas of this region have always been responsible for producing excessive soil erosion in the associated river basin. This erosion phenomenon becomes hazardous during the rainy season, thereby contributing to various environmental problems, and consequently, necessitating soil erosion control planning in the Saranda forest. Hence, this study aimed to estimate average annual soil erosion in the Saranda region in terms of the spatial distribution using the Geographic Information System (GIS) integrated Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model. The erosion was quantified at a spatial resolution of 10 m (pixel by pixel) using the GIS-based RUSLE inputs. This study also applies GIS integrated Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model to identify the favorable zones for sediment deposition in the study area. On the basis of erosion severity, the entire study area is classified into six categories (very low to extreme). The study reveals that the Saranda forest's average annual soil erosion is 76 tons per hectare per year (t/ha/yr). Approximately 63% of the total area is categorized under very low to low erosion category, and the relevant area is mainly covered by forest land, whereas the mining region comprises less than 1% of the total study area with extremely high soil erosion (156 t/ha/yr) potential. As envisaged from the present study, the erosion-prone mining areas are located within a 1-5 km range of the adjacent Karo and Koina rivers, thereby, necessitating the erosion control strategy to avoid the possible threats. From this perspective, the study also investigates the favorable zones for sediment deposition using the GIS integrated AHP model to suggest the appropriate erosion control measures. Finally, the RUSLE and AHP models are combined on the GIS platform to identify the distressed catchment area. Moreover, 42% (41,060 ha) of the total area is disturbed due to the present mining activities, which involves 11 sub-watersheds, and their associated 50 micro-watersheds. From the context of watershed conservation, erosion control measures are also recommended. The methodology adopted in this study can be easily extended to any global mining-dominated catchment for sustainable conservation planning.

AB  - Efficient energy use by the agriculture sector is one of the conditions for sustainable agriculture because it allows financial savings, fossil resources preservation and air pollution decrease. We propose an Energy indicator (I-En) to evaluate environmental impacts due to energy consumption of arable farming systems to help farmers to manage their energy inputs at the field level according to the guidelines of integrated agriculture. I-En is based on the energetic analysis of four types of energy: two for indirect energy (pesticides and fertilisers) and two for direct energy (machinery and irrigation systems). In a second step, the assessed values of energy consumption are converted by means of an abacus into a mark between 0 and 10. I-En needs only data that are available on farms or easily assessed, and will be implemented with a set of seven other agro-ecological indicators to assess environmental sustainability of farms.

AB  - A study was conducted in Thuma area in central Malawi to quantify contemporary land cover and to explore the degree of land use change in the Thuma forest reserve area of Malawi by analysing and comparing satellite-derived land cover maps from 1997, 2007 and 2017. The study was carried out using Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS), focusing on analysis of Landsat 5 ETM and Landsat 8 ORI/TIRS satellite images. The classification was conducted for the following distinct classes; closed forest, open forest, shrubland, savanna grassland, agriculture fields, and water. The analysis revealed that closed forest diminished from 19% in 1997 to 10% in 2007 to 6% in 2017. Open forest reduced from 30% to 21% from 1997 to 2007 but increased to 22% in 2017. Agriculture area almost doubled from 37% in 1997 to 64% in 2017. The actual area from 1997 to 2017, shows that closed forest has reduced from 7,000 ha to 3,000 ha while open forest from 12,900 ha to 7800 ha. Savanna grassland has doubled from 5,900 ha to 13,000 ha. However, future studies should use modern satellites such as Sentinel and Landsat 9 for improved quantification of changes. The findings show that even the protected forest reserve (previously dominated by closed forest) is not fully protected from deforestation by local communities. Government and other stakeholders should devise measures to meet the needs of the surrounding communities and the ecological/biophysical needs of the reserves. Based on this study, issues of re-demarcation of the forest reserve and the accessed area should also be explored. This study serves as a reference for the management of Thuma Forest Reserve as a refuge for natural tree species, rivers that harbour endemic fish species (Opsaridium microlepis and Opsaridium microcephalis) and the sustainable management of endangered elephants in the reserve.

AB  - Drought is a widespread hazard that can tremendously affect the biodiversity, habitat of wild species, and ecosystem functioning and stability, especially in the dry region. Due to its geographic location, the north-western region of Bangladesh has a comparatively arid climate which is very much susceptible to drought occurrence and is marked as a red zone. Despite the growing evidence of the impact of drought on food security and ecosystem functioning, little effort has been paid to mitigate the drought in this region. The present study aimed to assess the drought condition of the north-western region of Bangladesh using earth observation techniques. For this purpose, Landsat data from 1990 to 2020 was used to determine various vegetation indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Water Index (NDWI), Moisture Index (NDMI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), along with Land Surface Temperature (LST). Results show that the depletion of forests (2832 km2) and water bodies (6773 km2) resulted from the expansion of settlement (6563 km2) and agricultural land (1802 km2) for the period 1990-2020. Examination of the temporal changes of vegetation indices and LST showed that the values of all indices decreased while the LST increased. The negative correlation between NDVI value and LST indicates that the vegetation in our study was subject to drought-induced shocks. This study reveals the current situation of the vegetation health in the north-western region of Bangladesh in relation to the drought conditions. The findings of this study have practical implications for the policymakers in implementing necessary measures for agriculture, forests, water development, and economic zone planning.

AB  - Aim of this work was to point out the main direct environmental impacts (i. e., waste generation, water use, and energy use) of the food industry, as well as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the agro-food system in industrialised countries. Based on GHG inventories and technical literature, agricultural production appears to be the hotspot in the life cycle of food products. Several life cycle assessment procedures, such as the Carbon Footprint (CF), Bilan Carbone (R), Environmental Product Declaration (R), are currently available and can help to identify more sustainable options. The available CF data were used to show how the so called Mediterranean-type diet might promote sustainable lifestyles in the developed countries with a more favourable impact on the environment and health. A progressive approach to food sustainability was also outlined.

AB  - Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a prevalent pregnancy complication that seriously endangers maternal and infant health, posing a medical and economic burden worldwide. Several dietary patterns have been recommended for women of childbearing age, demonstrating a positive role in preventing and managing GDM. However, these dietary patterns may not fully take environmental factors into account when addressing global food sustainability and planetary health. In this context, the EAT-Lancet Commission proposed a diet in 2019 aimed at both health improvement and environmental sustainability, which can potentially reduce the prevalence of diet-related diseases. Nevertheless, the role of the EAT-Lancet reference diet in preventing and managing GDM has not been fully evaluated. Therefore, we conducted a literature search to assess the existing evidence for the association between the EAT-Lancet reference diet components and GDM. Based on the current evidence available in the PubMed database from inception to 31 October 2024, women of childbearing age are recommended to consume whole grains, fish, soy products, olive oil, full-fat dairy products, nuts, and moderate amounts of fruits while reducing red meat and sugar-sweetened beverage intake to lower the risk of GDM. There remains inconsistency regarding the association between tubers or starchy vegetables, vegetables, eggs, and poultry and the risk of GDM. In conclusion, current research on the association between diet and GDM is limited and offers suggestions for methodologies to obtain robust evidence regarding the association between the EAT-Lancet reference diet and GDM.

AB  - Food insecurity refers to the uncertain availability of or limited access to nutritious food. Poor diets prevalent among food insecure populations may incite an inflammatory state and subsequently negatively affect skeletal muscle metabolism. To examine the inflammatory mechanistic potential of the association between food insecurity and the risk of low muscle strength, we analyzed cross-sectional data from 8624 adults aged >= 20 years from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2014-2015. Household food security status was assessed using an 18-item food security survey module. The inflammatory potential of diets was estimated by the dietary inflammation index (DII). Low muscle strength was ascertained using hand grip strength. In the multivariable-adjusted model, greater food insecurity was significantly associated with a higher DII score and risk of low muscle strength. The multivariable-adjusted mean difference (95% confidence interval) on the DII, comparing the "moderate-to-severe" food insecurity group with the "food secure" group, was 0.43 (0.06-0.80) (P-trend: <0.001) and the odds ratio (95% confidence intervals) of low muscle strength for the same comparison groups was 2.06 (1.07-3.96) (P-trend: 0.005). Our results suggest that individuals with greater food insecurity may be susceptible to diets with greater inflammatory potential, which may contribute to a loss of muscle strength.

AB  - Land degradation and restoration profoundly affect soil CH(4)uptake capacity in terrestrial ecosystems. However, a comprehensive assessment of the response of soil CH(4)uptake to land degradation and restoration at global scale is not available. Here, we present a global meta-analysis with a database of 228 observations from 83 studies to investigate the effects of land degradation and restoration on the capacity of soil CH(4)uptake. We found that land degradation significantly decreased the capacity of soil CH(4)uptake, except the conversion of pasture to cropland where the soil CH(4)uptake rate showed no response. In contrast, all types of land restoration significantly increased the capacity of soil CH(4)uptake. Interestingly, the response of soil CH(4)uptake rate to land degradation and restoration was asymmetric: the increased soil CH(4)uptake rate in response to the land restoration was smaller compared to the decrease in CH(4)uptake rate induced by the land degradation. The effect of land degradation on soil CH(4)uptake rate was not dependent on the time since land use change, but the CH(4)sink strength increased with the time since land restoration. The response of soil CH(4)uptake rate to both land degradation and restoration was predominantly regulated by changes in the soil water-filled pore space, soil bulk density, and pH, whereas alterations in the substrate quantity and quality had negligible effect. Additionally, the effects of land degradation and restoration on soil CH(4)uptake were strongly related to the mean annual precipitation and soil texture. Overall, our results provide novel insights for understanding of how land degradation and restoration can affect the CH(4)sink strength of upland soils, and more importantly, our findings are beneficial to take measures to enhance the potential of soil CH(4)uptake in response to global land use change.

AB  - Grain yield prediction affects policy making in various aspects such as agricultural production planning, food security assurance, and adjustment of foreign trade. Accurately predicting grain yield is of great significance in ensuring global food security. This paper is based on the MODIS remote sensing image data products from 2010 to 2020, and adds band information such as vegetation index and temperature to form composite remote sensing data as a dataset. Aiming at the lack of models for large-scale forecasting and the need for human intervention in traditional models, this paper proposes a grain production estimation model based on deep learning. First, image cropping and yield mapping techniques are used to process the data to generate training samples. Then the channel and spatial attention mechanism (convolutional block attention module, CBAM) is added to extract spatial information in different remote sensing bands to improve the efficiency of the model. Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks are added to obtain feature information in the time dimension. Finally, a national-scale grain yield prediction model is constructed. After the study, it was found that the LSTM model using a combination of multi-source satellite images and an attention mechanism can effectively predict grain yield in China. Furthermore, the proposed model was tested on data from 2018 to 2020 showing an average R-2 of 0.940 and an average RMSE of 80,020 tons, indicating that it can predict Chinese grain yield better. The model proposed in this paper extracts grain yield information directly from the composite remote sensing data, and solves the problem of small-scale research and imprecise yield prediction in an end-to-end manner.

AB  - Poultry farming plays a significant role in ensuring food security and economic growth in many countries. However, various factors such as feeding management practices, environmental conditions, and diseases lead to poultry mortality (dead birds). Therefore, regular monitoring of flocks and timely veterinary assistance is crucial for maintaining poultry health, well-being, and the success of poultry farming operations. However, the current monitoring method relies on manual inspection by farm workers, which is time-consuming. Therefore, developing an automatic early mortality detection (MD) model with higher accuracy is necessary to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in poultry. This study aimed to develop, evaluate, and test the performance of YOLOv5-MD and YOLOv6-MD models in detecting poultry mortality under various cage-free (CF) housing settings, including camera height, litter condition, and feather coverage. The results demonstrated that the YOLOv5s-MD model performed exceptionally well, achieving a high mAP@0.50 score of 99.5%, a high FPS of 55.6, low GPU usage of 1.04 GB, and a fast-processing time of 0.4 h. Furthermore, this study also evaluated the models' performances under different CF housing settings, including different levels of feather coverage, litter coverage, and camera height. The YOLOv5s-MD model with 0% feathered covering achieved the best overall performance in object detection, with the highest mAP@0.50 score of 99.4% and a high precision rate of 98.4%. However, 80% litter covering resulted in higher MD. Additionally, the model achieved 100% precision and recall in detecting hens' mortality at the camera height of 0.5 m but faced challenges at greater heights such as 2 m. These findings suggest that YOLOv5s-MD can detect poultry mortality more accurately than other models, and its performance can be optimized by adjusting various CF housing settings. Therefore, the developed model can assist farmers in promptly responding to mortality events by isolating affected birds, implementing disease prevention measures, and seeking veterinary assistance, thereby helping to reduce the impact of poultry mortality on the industry, ensuring the well-being of poultry and the overall success of poultry farming operations.

AB  - The use of aesthetics for classifying and accepting fresh food for sale and consumption is built into food quality standards and regulations of the European Union. The food distribution sector in Europe and the UK is oligopolistic in nature; a small number of supermarket chains control a large market share. The influence of these 'multiples' enables them to impose additional proprietary 'quality' criteria. Produce that doesn't meet these standards may be lost from the food supply chain, never seeing a supermarket shelf - it may not get past the supplier, or even leave the farm. Here, for the first time, we estimate the quantity of food loss and waste of fresh fruit and vegetables arising from cosmetic standards in Europe and UK, and its associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We find few direct measurements of such losses, resulting in large uncertainties for key commodities. In the context of these uncertainties, we estimate avoidable FLW from on-farm cosmetic grade-outs of up to 4500 kt yr(-1) in the UK and 51,500 kt yr(-1) in the European Economic Area (EEA). Our estimates suggest over a third of total farm production is lost for aesthetic reasons, which equates to as much as 970 kt CO(2)e (UK) and 22,500 kt CO(2)e (EEA) of embedded production-phase GHG emissions annually. Examining the issue from the perspective of markets, suppliers, and consumers we establish there is an over-emphasis on superficial qualities (i.e. cosmetic appearance) of fresh produce, which leads to its unnecessary loss and waste. Using an illustrative case study, we provide potential avenues to mitigate these losses and the associated GHG emissions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We quantified the avoided deforestation impacts of environmental land registration in Brazil's Amazonian states of Mato Grosso and Para between 2005 and 2014. We find that the program reduced deforestation on registered lands. The magnitude of the effect implies that deforestation in the two states would have been 10% higher in the absence of the program. The impacts of registration varied over time, likely due to changing suites of policies linking environmental registration to land use incentives. Our results also reveal that agriculturally suitable lands and those located in regions undergoing the most land-use change were more likely to be registered than those in less suitable, less dynamic regions. We conclude that environmental registration is an important first step in implementing avoided deforestation policies targeting private landholders.

AB  - The Special Issue (SI) "Environmental Risk Mitigation for Sustainable Land Use Development" presents seventeen interrelated papers addressing the key concept of environmental risk mitigation and sustainable land use development. The issue argues that risk mitigation depends directly on the risk assessment analysis and the quality of applied measures. Therefore, the more precise are risk assessment conclusions, the better the risk mitigation measures would be. This collection of papers follows the vision of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 (Sendai Framework) which states that the integration of sustainable development objectives into disaster risk mitigation and adaptation at all levels and at all stages of policy action are of paramount importance for the sustainability of our communities. The final purpose of the issue is to address the mutual roles of land use policy on environmental risk mitigation and adaptation, especially disaster risks.

AB  - Carbon storage in soils is one of the most promising strategies for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and the associated climate change. In this context, how plant root systems respond to the elevation of the atmospheric CO2 concentration is of crucial importance because these organs are the main source of C input into the soils. It is expected that root growth will be stimulated by elevated CO2 as a consequence of enhanced photosynthesis, and that this will favour belowground C sequestration. In add-ition, larger root systems with optimized architecture are also expected to improve water and nutrient acquisition by plants, and to indirectly stimulate photosynthetic CO2 capture. This review critically examines the evidence supporting these expectations from a molecular physiology perspective. We illustrate the strong but highly variable effects of elevated CO2 on root system size and architecture, and provide an update on the signal-ling mechanisms that may trigger these effects. This highlights the lack of knowledge on the physiological and genetic bases of the root growth and development response to ele-vated CO2, but shows that candidate genes and genetic resources are largely available to fill this gap.

AB  - The persistent and undiscriminating application of chemicals as means to improve crop growth, development and yields for several years has become problematic to agricultural sustainability because of the adverse effects these chemicals have on the produce, consumers and beneficial microbes in the ecosystem. Therefore, for agricultural productivity to be sustained there are needs for better and suitable preferences which would be friendly to the ecosystem. The use of microbial metabolites has become an attractive and more feasible preference because they are versatile, degradable and ecofriendly, unlike chemicals. In order to achieve this aim, it is then imperative to explore microbes that are very close to the root of a plant, especially where they are more concentrated and have efficient activities called the rhizosphere. Extensive varieties of bacteria, archaea, fungi and other microbes are found inhabiting the rhizosphere with various interactions with the plant host. Therefore, this review explores various beneficial microbes such as bacteria, fungi and archaea and their roles in the environment in terms of acquisition of nutrients for plants for the purposes of plant growth and health. It also discusses the effect of root exudate on the rhizosphere microbiome and compares the three domains at molecular levels.

AB  - The sequestration of excess atmospheric C into resilient and long-lasting belowground pools is of increasing global importance to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. One land use that is particularly amenable to this type of manipulation is agricultural land, which often has high sequestration potential. However, this capacity can depend on local factors such as cropping history, soil type and climate. Critically, it may also be limited by N availability. In this study we used the retrospective (repeated measures) methodology to assess the impact on previously arable land of land use change by either afforestation with two species of broadleaf trees planted at 800 or 1600 stems ha(-1) (T800 and T1600), or reversion to rough grassland (NT) for 21 years. We quantified the concentration, distribution and total stocks of organic C and N in the upper 0-30 cm of a common soil type found in NE Scotland and investigated the robustness of C:N to land use change. Finally we estimated ecosystem stocks of C and N, and how these were partitioned between plant and soil components. We found increases in the overall concentrations of soil C from 4.6% to 5.8%, and N from 0.32% to 0.43%. The increase in soil C stocks over the experiment was in the order NT > T800 > T1600 and each treatment differed significantly. The same pattern was seen for increases in N stocks but here the increases in NT and T800 were significantly greater than for T1600. Overall, stocks were higher in the rough grassland plots than under trees by 35 Mg ha(-1) for C and 2.2 Mg ha(-1) for N. These increases in stocks were accompanied by a highly significant narrowing in C:N with time across all treatments from 14.6 to 13.6 and differences seen between upper and lower soil layers in 1991 had disappeared by 2012. From an average of 151 Mg ha(-1) in 1991, the system C stock (soil + plants) had increased to between 202 Mg ha(-1) (NT) and 221 Mg ha(-1) (T1600) by 2012, with between 96% (NT) and 73% (T1600) of the C in the soil. Concurrently the system stock of N had increased to between 14.1 Mg ha(-1) (NT) and 11.3 Mg ha(-1) (T1600), from an average of 9.4 Mg ha(-1) in 1991, with between 99% (NT) and 81% (T1600) of the system N in the soil. Although in 2012 there were significantly greater soil C stocks in NT, this was offset by C accumulation in the treatments containing trees, such that overall there were no treatment differences. However, this was not seen with system N stocks in 2012, which were significantly larger in the NT treatment than in those with trees. Mean annual rates of C and N accumulation in the systems were greatest in NT (2.7 and 0.22 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and least in T1600 (0.7 and 0.08 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)). These results are important in the context of land use strategies aimed at pollution mitigation, such as C sequestration and nitrate leaching. They are also relevant to the possible effects of land use change, especially reversion to agricultural use, of land previously taken out of production.

AB  - Multi-cropping is becoming an increasingly popular technique in agriculture to tackle major and complex agroecosystem problems such as biodiversity and soil fertility loss, erosion and degradation, increased greenhouse gas emissions, etc. Comprehensively assessing the impact of multi-cropping intensity on agroecosystems is a new and still under-researched approach that can provide a better understanding of the impact of individual indicators on the overall functioning of biodiverse agroecosystems. Data from a stationary field experiment using multi-cropping at the Vytautas Magnus University Experimental Station between 2020 and 2022 were used to carry out this study. The study included maize, hemp, and faba bean as single, binary, and ternary crops. A complex assessment approach (CEI value) was used to determine the impact of these crops on the agroecosystem, the interrelationships between the main indicators, and the strength of their effects. It was found that the ternary maize-hemp-faba bean crop had the most positive effect on the agroecosystem. The effectiveness of other crops was 2 to 35% less. The lowest value was calculated for the maize-faba bean crop.

AB  - The energy demand in Indonesia has increased significantly with its population growth, urbanization, and economic development. The growing concern of meeting energy demand while reducing dependency on fossil fuels has resulted in an increasing demand for renewable energy. As a country with a rich biomass base, bioenergy is now an important component of Indonesia's energy agenda. However, a crucial problem in bioenergy production is the selection of species that can provide a sustainable supply of feedstock without having an impact on food security and the environment. In this context, we discuss the characteristics and benefits of using bamboo, a perennial grass, as a potential species for bioenergy feedstock in Indonesia. We describe the fuel characteristics of bamboo along with the possibility to align its cultivation, production, and usage with environmental and developmental agendas which makes it a suitable bioenergy crop in the country. In addition, its ability to grow on degraded lands, fast growth, long root system, and easy maintenance prove it as a powerful ally for the restoration of degraded land. We recommend in-depth research on the social, ecological, and economic feasibility of using this species for bioenergy production.

AB  - The lockdown in Britain has rendered a large proportion of the population economically vulnerable and has at least quadrupled demand for emergency food relief. This paper looks critically at response to the crisis from the government and the voluntary sector with respect to provision of emergency food. In doing so, it has exposed gaps in understanding of the vagaries of the food supply for certain population groups and systemic weaknesses in the current system of emergency food aid. We make recommendations for healthier governmental capacity to react to a food security crisis, better relationships between the government and the voluntary sector, and further research into the dietary constraints of the precariate. Importantly, the social system needs to be responsive to short-term changes in people's income if people are not to fall into food insecurity.

AB  - At 35%, world food production wastage is jeopardising the sustainability of global resources and the future of food security, especially considering that agriculture uses 60% and 37% of the world water and land resources. Ironically, rural populations are most exposed to poverty and hunger when they feed the world. Through a literature review, this paper will demonstrate that supply management, based on consumption, is a solution to food wastage and can in parallel, improve rural wealth, introduce sustainable agricultural practices, resolve major urban pressures and bring about global climate change adaptation. The concepts presented in this paper confront modern world agricultural policies as production management systems are being abolished throughout the world, including Canada.

AB  - According to the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), the world loses 1.0 x 106 hm2 forest land through deforestation annually. About 1.6 x 106 people who depend on forests for livelihood are negatively affected by deforestation and forest degradation. The paper attempts to study the impact of forest governance, enforcement and socio-economic factors on deforestation and forest degradation at the local level in West Bengal State, India. The study was based on questionnaire survey data during 2020-2021 collected from three western districts (Purulia, Bankura, and Paschim Medinipur) where deforestation and poverty rates are higher than other districts in West Bengal State. The total number of selected villages was 29, and the total sample households were 693. A stratified random sampling technique was used to collect data, and a questionnaire was followed. Forest governance and enforcement indices were constructed using United Nation Development Programme (UNDP) methodology and a step-wise logistic regression model was used to identify the factors affecting deforestation and forest degradation. The result of this study showed that four factors (illegal logging, weak forest administration, encroachment, and poverty) are identified for the causes of deforestation and forest degradation. It is observed that six indices of forest governance (rule of law, transparency, accountability, participation, inclusiveness and equitability, and efficiency and effectiveness) is relatively high in Purulia District. Moreover, this study shows that Purulia and Bankura districts follow medium forest governance, while Paschim Medinipur District has poor forest governance. The enforcement index is found to be highest in Purulia District (0.717) and lowest for Paschim Medinipur District (0.257). Finally, weak forest governance, poor socio-economic conditions of the households, and weak enforcement lead to the deforestation and forest degradationin the study area. Therefore, governments should strengthen law enforcement and encourage sustainable forest certification schemes to combat illegal logging.

AB  - Purpose: To examine dietary exposure to 25 pesticide residues in several diet groups including omnivores, pesco-vegetarians, vegetarians and vegans while accounting for the farming system (organic or conventional) of plant-based foods consumed. Methods: Organic and conventional consumption data in combination with data on pesticide residues in plant-based foods were used to derive estimated dietary exposure to pesticide residues. Pesticide residue exposure was estimated based on observed data, and using two scenarios simulated for 100%-conventional and 100%-organic diets in 33,018 omnivores, 555 pesco-vegetarians, 501 vegetarians and 368 vegans from the NutriNet-Sante study. Pesticide residue exposure across groups was compared using Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results: Exposure levels varied across diet groups depending on the pesticide studied. The highest exposure was observed for imazalil in all groups. Vegetarians appeared to be less exposed to the studied pesticides overall. Compared to omnivores - apart from pesticides authorised in organic farming - vegetarians had lowest exposure. The 100%-conventional scenario led to a sharp increase in exposure to pesticide residues, except for pesticides allowed in organic farming and conversely for the 100%-organic scenario. Conclusions: Despite their high plant-based product consumption, vegetarians were less exposed to synthetic pesticides than omnivores, due to their greater propensity to consume organic.

AB  - Pollinators are critical for food security; however, their contribution to the pollina-tion of locally important crops is still unclear, especially for non-bee pollinators. We reviewed the diversity, conservation status, and role of bee and non-bee polli-nators in 83 different crops described either as important for the global food market or of local importance. Bees are the most commonly recorded crop floral visitors. However, non-bee pollinators are frequently recorded visitors to crops of local importance. Non-bee pollinators in tropical ecosystems include nocturnal insects, bats, and birds. Importantly, nocturnal pollinators are neglected in current diurnal-oriented research and are experiencing declines. The integration of non-bee polli-nators into scientific studies and conservation agenda is urgently required for more sustainable agriculture and safeguarding food security for both globally and locally important crops.

AB  - Both the means by which we produce our food and our eating habits influence some of the most important environmental problems of our planet. The most exploited livestock for the past 50 years has been cattle, which are fed primarily on maize to increase production. However, this combination of maize and cattle is inefficient in ecological terms. Producing and consuming proteins from animals with more efficient biomass and energy conversions could help to solve certain environmental problems. For instance, insects that are considered pests in agricultural systems - including, specifically, the Orthoptera species - may be excellent candidates as protein sources. This work analyses the feed conversion ratio (FCR) of the three types of livestock that are most widely bred worldwide: cattle, pigs, and poultry. It then compares these results with those of potential minilivestock from the Orthoptera species that are more abundant in agroecosystems. Based on the calculated FCRs (cow:pork:poultry:grasshopper pests and insects grown on farms; 10:6:2:4:1.7), we project that reducing beef production by half could significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions and the maize sowing hectares destined for feed (2.1-2.9 X 10(7) ha), while simultaneously releasing maize for human consumption. Additionally, consuming insect-based protein could reduce pollution problems by decreasing insecticide use (by at least 7 X 10(7) l). Though a comprehensive solution to current environmental problems (e.g. global warming), will require coordinated global effort (e.g. to replace fossil fuels), there is one way that everyone can contribute: eating grasshopper burgers instead of beef burgers.

AB  - Mangroves play a key role in carbon sequestration along tropical and subtropical coastlines, mainly as a result of their high primary productivity and the anoxic character of their soils, in which organic matter decay processes are slow. Unfortunately, these forests are disappearing worldwide, notably due to aqua culture and the need for space on the shoreline. The mangrove area in Viet Nam decreased substantially until late 90's, which was a concern for the Vietnamese government. Then, replantation programs were developed in order to protect the shoreline against the erosion; like in northern Viet Nam, where monospecific stands were planted from the mid 90's. Within this context, our objectives were to determine carbon stocks and carbon burial rates in the soil of a 18 years old Kandelia obovata (Sheue, Lui & Yong) mangrove forest. Three plots were set up in the planted mangroves and three in adjacent bare land (without any mangrove) at the mouth of Red River. Three geo-slicers up to 100 cm depth were taken in each plot; and in each core, ten soil samples were collected with a 10 cm depth interval. Later on, dead and live roots were sorted. Carbon contents in soils and in roots were determined using the Walkley-Black method and loss on ignition (LOI) method, respectively. Then, the total belowground carbon sequestration was estimated. There was a depth related distribution of organic carbon in soil with the highest concentrations measured between 20 and 60 cm depth. Accumulated carbon up to depth of 100 cm in soil and roots of the planted K. obovata were 146.78 +/- 3.87 Mg OC ha(-1) and 12.67 +/- 0.14 Mg OC ha(-1), respectively. The value was 87.59 +/- 1.08 Mg OC ha(-1) for the adjacent bare land. Consequently, the mean carbon burial rate for this system was approximately 6.94 Mg OC ha(-1) yr(-1), which is higher than most of the mangroves and may be related to a low export of the net primary productivity or most likely to a high sedimentation rate. These results were compared with previously published results on carbon stocks in younger planted forests of the same species in the same region, a positive and linear relationship was determined between the age of the planted stand and the below ground carbon stocks.

AB  - In this paper we present the first global assessments of COVID-19's impacts on food systems and their actors, focusing specifically on the food security and nutritional status of those affected in low and middle-income countries. The assessment covers 62 countries and is based on the analysis of 337 documents published in English, French, Spanish and Portuguese. The review confirms the magnitude and the severity of an unprecedented crisis that has spread worldwide and has spared only a few. The analysis shows that the dimension of food security that has been most affected is accessibility, with reasonably solid evidence suggesting that both financial and physical access to food have been disrupted. In contrast, there is no clear evidence that the availability of food has been affected. Overall, data suggests that food systems resisted and adapted to the disruption of the pandemic. This resilience came, however, at great costs, with the majority of the systems' actors having to cope with severe disruptions in their activities. In contrast, grocery stores and supermarkets made billions of dollars in profits in 2020.

AB  - Deforestation is a leading cause of biodiversity loss and an important source of global carbon emissions. This means that there are important synergies between climate policy and conservation policy. The highest rates of deforestation occur in tropical countries, where much of the land at the forest frontier is managed informally by smallholders and where governance systems tend to be weak. These features must be considered when designing policies to reduce emissions from deforestation such as REDD+. Deforestation is often accompanied by fires that release large amounts of carbon dioxide. These emissions are especially high in the case of peatlands which contain thick layers of carbon-rich matter. In this paper we derive marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves using data from a farmer survey in Sumatra, where rates of peatland deforestation are high. Comparing these results with farmers' stated willingness to accept payment not to clear forest to establish oil palm suggests that REDD+ policies may be more expensive than MAC estimates suggest The extent to which this is true depends on the types of soils being deforested.

AB  - Remote sensing assessments of land use and land cover change (LULCC) are critical to improve understanding of socio-economic, institutional and ecological processes that lead to and stem from land use change. This is particularly crucial in the emerging frontiers of Southern Africa, where there is a paucity of LULCC studies relative to the humid tropics. This study focuses on Gurue District (5606 km2) of Zambezia province of Mozambique, one of many countries in the region that has experienced a recent growth in foreign investments in agriculture through large-scale land acquisitions, often resulting in land use conversions and modifications. Previous LULCC assessments covering Mozambique have focused on dynamics between natural and anthropogenic land categories, with limited efforts to distinguish the different land use agents associated with these changes, and relating this with social, economic and technological processes. In this study we built a new LULC assessment methodology that leverages the power of open remote sensing data and tools to integrate categorical and continuous training and validation data obtained from field surveys and Collect Earth software within Google Earth Engine. We then examined the suitability of five pixel-based compositing techniques for generating cloud-free Landsat images that can support analysis of land use dynamics in persistently cloudy, mosaic landscapes with more limited Landsat archives. Drawing upon the spectral and textural features of Landsat data in pixel-based composites, we classified land use over three time periods, 2006, 2012 and 2016, and characterized land use change, focusing on changes between small-scale cropland, large-scale mechanized cropland, and other land uses. This method can be upscaled and applied in many parts of Africa with similar historic image availability challenges, and similar economic contexts with great disparities between small-scale unmechanized cropland and very large-scale mechanized cropland, to explore land consolidation dynamics and agent-specific pathways of land use change.

AB  - Norway has vast rangeland resources (292,361 km(2)) with an estimated carrying capacity of nearly four million sheep and lambs, twice the current number. However, the intensive production system currently applied has led to more concentrate dependency, resulting in heavier animals in addition to poorer utilization of rangelands and homegrown feed. Intensive feeding systems indirectly influence the sustainability of ecosystems by promoting intensive cropping that can deplete soil fertility and threaten landscape preservation and biodiversity. By contrast, extensive grazing systems can produce environmentally and animal-friendly food products and contribute to regulating soil health, water and nutrient cycling, soil carbon sequestration, and recreational environments. In this paper, the economics of current sheep feeding practices in Norway, using a linear programming model, were compared with more extensive systems which allow for higher usage of on-farm feed resources. Changes in current sheep farming practices have the potential to increase lamb meat production relative to mutton production, in addition to improving the year-round supply of fresh meat. The investigated alternatives, using the Norwegian White Sheep (NWS) breed, suggest that delayed lambing is useful only on farms with abundant pastures available for autumn feeding. Lambs achieve a better market price than hoggets and mature sheep. Therefore, based on the current Norwegian meat market and price offered per kilogram of meat for lamb, an increase in NWS lamb production improves farm profits. On the other hand, when the aim is on greater use of homegrown feed and rangelands, this can be achieved through hogget production, and the quantity of concentrates required can be reduced substantially.

AB  - The paper provides a systematic review and analysis of the current literature on big data (BD) applications in the context of food supply chain management (FSCM) in order to categorize the state-of-the-art research trends exploring the adoption and implementation of big data analytics (BDA) across different segments of food supply chain (FSC). The use of BDA brings the digital transformation of FSCs closer providing sustainable implications and added value to their operation. Harnessing BD's potential is becoming more and more relevant in addressing the constantly evolving complexities in food systems. However, the field of BD applications in the FSCM domain is severely fragmented and relatively "primitive". The present research is one of the earliest attempts to recognize and present a comprehensive analysis for the BD applications across different segments of FSC proposing a conceptual framework that illustrates the role of BD in a data-driven FSCM environment. For the purposes of our research, we adopted the systematic literature review (SLR) method aiming at the identification of the dominant categories and themes within the research area. Based on the SLR findings, we propose a conceptual framework that captures the interconnection between FSC performance and BD applications by using the input-process-output (IPO) model within a data-driven FSCM context. The main research contribution lies on the thematic classification of relevant research, the conceptualization of this fragmented field, the development of a conceptual framework, and the presentation of a future research agenda pertaining to BD applications in a data-driven FSCM context.

AB  - Organic amendments, such as compost and biochar, mitigate the environmental burdens associated with wasting organic resources and close nutrient loops by capturing, transforming, and resupplying nutrients to soils. While compost or biochar application to soil can enhance an agroecosystem's capacity to store carbon and produce food, there have been few field studies investigating the agroecological impacts of amending soil with biochar co-compost, produced through the composting of nitrogen-rich organic material, such as manure, with carbon-rich biochar. Here, we examine the impact of biochar co-compost on soil properties and processes by conducting a field study in which we compare the environmental and agronomic impacts associated with the amendment of either dairy manure co-composted with biochar, dairy manure compost, or biochar to soils in a winter wheat cropping system. Organic amendments were applied at equivalent C rates (8 Mg C ha(-1)). We found that all three treatments significantly increased soil water holding capacity and total plant biomass relative to the no-amendment control. Soils amended with biochar or biochar co-compost resulted in significantly less greenhouse gas emissions than the compost or control soils. Biochar co-compost also resulted in a significant reduction in nutrient leaching relative to the application of biochar alone or compost alone. Our results suggest that biochar co-composting could optimize organic resource recycling for climate change mitigation and agricultural productivity while minimizing nutrient losses from agroecosystems.

AB  - Biochar has been heralded as an amendment to revitalize degraded soils, improve soil carbon sequestration, increase agronomic productivity, and enter into future carbon trading markets. However, scientific and economic technicalities may limit the ability of biochar to consistently deliver on these expectations. Past research has demonstrated that biochar is part of the black carbon continuum with variable properties due to the net result of production (e.g., feedstock and pyrolysis conditions) and postproduction factors (storage or activation). Therefore, biochar is not a single entity but rather spans a wide range of black carbon forms. Biochar is black carbon, but not all black carbon is biochar. Agronomic benefits arising from biochar additions to degraded soils have been emphasized, but negligible and negative agronomic effects have also been reported. Fifty percent of the reviewed studies reported yield increases after black carbon or biochar additions, with the remainder of the studies reporting alarming decreases to no significant differences. Hardwood biochar (black carbon) produced by traditional methods (kilns or soil pits) possessed the most consistent yield increases when added to soils. The universality of this conclusion requires further evaluation due to the highly skewed feedstock preferences within existing studies. With global population expanding while the amount of arable land remains limited, restoring soil quality to nonproductive soils could be key to meeting future global food production, food security, and energy supplies; biochar may play a role in this endeavor. Biochar economics are often marginally viable and are tightly tied to the assumed duration of agronomic benefits. Further research is needed to determine the conditions under which biochar can provide economic and agronomic benefits and to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms responsible for these benefits.

AB  - The perspective of 'biocomplexity' in the form of 'coupled natural and human systems' represents a resource for the future conservation of biodiversity hotspots in three direct ways: ( i) modelling the impact on biodiversity of private land-use decisions and public land- use policies, ( ii) indicating how the biocultural history of a biodiversity hotspot may be a resource for its future conservation, and ( iii) identifying and deploying the nodes of both the material and psycho-spiritual connectivity between human and natural systems in service to conservation goals. Three biocomplexity case studies of areas notable for their biodiversity, selected for their variability along a latitudinal climate gradient and a human-impact gradient, are developed: the Big Thicket in southeast Texas, the Upper Botanamo River Basin in eastern Venezuela, and the Cape Horn Archipelago at the austral tip of Chile. More deeply, the biocomplexity perspective reveals alternative ways of understanding biodiversity itself, because it directs attention to the human concepts through which biodiversity is perceived and understood. The very meaning of biodiversity is contestable and varies according to the cognitive lenses through which it is perceived.

AB  - Pollinators underpin sustainable livelihoods that link ecosystems, spiritual and cultural values, and customary governance systems with indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLCs) across the world. Biocultural diversity is a shorthand term for this great variety of people-nature interlinkages that have developed over time in specific ecosystems. Biocultural approaches to conservation explicitly build on the conservation practices inherent in sustaining these livelihoods. We used the Conceptual Framework of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services to analyse the biocultural approaches to pollinator conservation by IPLCs globally. The analysis identified biocultural approaches to pollinators across all six elements of the Conceptual Framework, with conservation-related practices occurring in 60 countries, in all continents except Antarctica. Practices of IPLCs that are important for biocultural approaches to pollinator conservation can be grouped into three categories: the practice of valuing diversity and fostering biocultural diversity; landscape management practices; and diversified farming systems. Particular IPLCs may use some or all of these practices. Policies that recognize customary tenure over traditional lands, strengthen indigenous and community-conserved areas, promote heritage listing and support diversified farming systems within a food sovereignty approach are among several identified that strengthen biocultural approaches to pollinator conservation, and thereby deliver mutual benefits for pollinators and people.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Increasing global temperature imposes large risks to food security globally and regionally. Besides, adaptation effort on cultivation practices, such as mulching, is urgent to overcome environmental problem due to certain material used, commonly plastic that is not biodegradable. Biodegradable mulch is a mulch that could be degraded by microorganism and made from renewable organic materials. It plays a role in carbon sequestration and will contribute carbon and nutrients to the soil after being degraded. This current research aimed at investigating soil microclimate under various biodegradable mulch compositions and optimizing the compositions of biodegradable mulch that can be used to support the growth of short-cycle crops i.e. horenso (Spinacia olearecea L.). METHODS: This study was carried out using a simple randomized complete block design with one control (without mulch) and five treatments (biodegradable mulch compositions), namely the percentage of water hyacinth (40-80%) and coconut coir (20-60%). FINDINGS: All tested biodegradable mulch compositions could modify microclimate by decreasing 1-2 degrees C of soil temperature and maintaining the soil moisture within the range of 63-84%. Although there was no significant difference in the growth and yield of horenso among the differing biodegradable mulch compositions, the biodegradable mulch composition treatments resulted in signficantly higher value than the control (without mulch). The biodegradable mulch composition treatments could increase fresh shoot weight around 38-55%, fresh root weight for about 55-94%, and dry shoot weight approximately by 1.6-2.8 times compared to the control (without mulch). CONCLUSION: This finding has emphasized that all tested biodegradable mulch compositions are potentially used as mulch for horenso (Spinacia oleracea L.) cultivation. This study provide information in the formulation of biodegradable mulch to adapt the compositions on other short-cycle crops and other horticulture crops. (C) 2021 GJESM. All rights reserved.

AB  - Given that agro-industrial activity is widely seen as a means of promoting development and the production of bioenergy has come to be considered a means of both fostering socioeconomic development and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the production of biodiesel would appear to be a means of promoting development in developing countries. The situation of Guinea-Bissau suggests the country may benefit from a biodiesel production program. Thus, this paper uses Brazil's experience with biodiesel as a basis for proposing a framework for a Biodiesel Program in Guinea-Bissau. The proposed framework includes the following elements related to public policy, regulations, organizations and mechanisms: (i) introduction of biodiesel through the creation and implementation of laws and regulations; (ii) an Inter-ministerial Executive Committee to plan, coordinate and manage the program; (iii) promotion, incentives and support for agricultural and agro-industrial production by providing tax benefits for specific links of the chain, creating incentive programs for different oilseeds and establishing programs that support family farming; and (iv) the creation and installation of representative bodies for the stakeholders involved in the chain, such as small farmers cooperatives, national association of biodiesel producers, R&D and rural extension programs.

AB  - Industrialization and other anthropogenic human activities pose significant environmental risks. As a result of the hazardous pollution, numerous living organisms may suffer from undesirable diseases in their separate habitats. Bioremediation, which removes hazardous compounds from the environment using microbes or their biologically active metabolites, is one of the most successful remediation approaches. According to the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), deteriorating soil health negatively impacts food security and human health over time. Soil health restoration is critical right now. Microbes are widely known for their importance in cleaning up toxins present in the soil, such as heavy metals, pesticides, and hydrocarbons. However, the capacity of local bacteria to digest these pollutants is limited, and the process takes an extended time. Genetically modified organisms (GMOs), whose altered metabolic pathways promote the over-secretion of a variety of proteins favorable to the bioremediation process, can speed up the breakdown process. The need for remediation procedures, degrees of soil contamination, site circumstances, broad adoptions, and numerous possibilities occurring at various cleaning stages are all studied in detail. Massive efforts to restore contaminated soils have also resulted in severe issues. This review focuses on the enzymatic removal of hazardous pollutants from the environment, such as pesticides, heavy metals, dyes, and plastics. There are also in-depth assessments of present discoveries and future plans for efficient enzymatic degradation of hazardous pollutants.

AB  - This article investigates the current status of the livestock industry (cattle, pigs, sheep, and poultry) in China and assesses the potential for biogas production from anaerobically digested livestock manure. According to calculation results based on the latest data of livestock released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China in 2018, China produced 2 x 10(12) kg of manure pollution in 2017, with pig waste representing the largest single manure source. Biogas that can be converted from high organic containing manure is a kind of clean bioenergy with low carbon footprint. In 2017, the energy potential from manure-produced biogas was about 5.74 x 10(12)-6.73 x 10(12) MJ, which corresponds to 4-5% of China's total energy demand. Correlation analysis between biogas production and the livestock industry showed that crop production had significant effects on manure-generated biogas production. However, it is necessary to address the challenges when applying AD technology. Bioenergy potential from manure will be lost during material collection and transportation. Although large-scale livestock farming remains controversial, this type of farming can improve the energy recovery rate of livestock manure. How to gain benefits and maintain sustainable development is also a bottleneck for AD promotion. Reducing energy input in AD projects as well as enhancing the efficiency of methanogenesis of livestock manure are key factors for achieving a high net output of biogas projects. More inclusive strategies and a broader vision should be adopted to allow stakeholders to benefit from manure-generated biogas projects.

AB  - Crop diversification into high-value crops (HVCs) can be a strategy to improve livelihood outcomes for farmers. Using data from a nationally representative survey, we establish that households diversifying toward HVCs are less likely to be poor, the biggest impact being for smallholders. Furthermore, using continuous treatment matching, we establish the relationship between degree of diversification (share of area dedicated to HVC) and poverty. Growers of HVCs need to allocate at least 50% area to HVCs to escape poverty. Effect of diversification on poverty is in general positive but it withers after a threshold probably because of constraints i.e., capital on smaller farms and labor on larger ones.

AB  - With the rise of globalization and technological competition, the food supply chain has grown more complex due to the multiple players and factors involved in the chain. Traditional systems fail to offer effective and reliable traceability solutions considering the increasing requirement for accountability and transparency in the food supply chain. Blockchain technology has been claimed to offer the food industry a transformative future. The inherent features of blockchain, including immutability and transparency, create a dependable and secure system for tracking food products across the whole supply chain, ensuring total control over their traceability from the origin to the final consumer. This research offers a comprehensive overview of multiple models to understand how the integration of blockchain and other digital technologies has transformed the food supply chain. This comprehensive systematic review of blockchain-based food-supply-chain frameworks aimed to uncover the capability of blockchain technology to revolutionize the industry and examined the current landscape of blockchain-based food traceability solutions to identify areas for improvement. Furthermore, the research investigates recent advancements and investigates how blockchain aligns with other emerging technologies of Industry 4.0 and Web 3.0. Blockchain technology plays an important role in improving food traceability and supply-chain operations. Potential synergies between blockchain and other emerging technologies of Industry 4.0 and Web 3.0 are digitizing food supply chains, which results in better management, automation, efficiencies, sustainability, verifiability, auditability, accountability, traceability, transparency, tracking, monitoring, response times and provenance across food supply chains.

AB  - Boosting soil carbon by adding it to the soil, is among climate mitigation strategies. In a viewpoint more than a decade ago, Kell (2011) proposed plant breeding as a tool to develop varieties with larger underground biomass as a method to store carbon in the soil and reverse the trends of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. To this date, the only evidence showing breeding for root traits is in rice. Wheat is well suited to serve this purpose because it is an important crop for food security and is the crop with highest cultivated area in the world. In this study, we developed breeding populations by crossing 'Penny' (a donor parent with large root) and 'Yecora' (a small root cultivar). Aboveground and belowground biomass partitioning, carbon content, and grain weight were studied in soil under controlled environment. Selection candidates differed significantly for all traits except carbon content. Broad-sense heritability for shoot biomass was 0.75 and for all other traits were equal or above 0.94. The root biomass ranged 0.43-7.72 g, averaging 2.13 g. A considerable range of root/shoot ratio was observed the selection candidates from 0.029 to 0.341, averaging 0.10. Based on LSD test, 13 out of 23 progenies tested in the replicated experiment, had significantly greater root biomass than 'Yecora'. Among those, there were lines that produced equal or greater grain weight than "Yecora". BC2 129, for example, showed 8.6-folds greater root biomass compared with 'Yecora' yet produced grain weight with no significant difference with that of 'Yecora'. Similarly, BC2 147, BC2 165, BC2 137, showed 3.1-folds, 2.4-folds, 2.3-folds, respectively, greater root biomass but similar grain weights compared with 'Yecora'. These lines showed significantly greater root/ shoot ratios. Roots collected at physiological maturity showed 40.2%, on average, carbon content per dry biomass. This study showed that given one cycle of breeding involving a donor germplasm from genebank wheat root system can be manipulated to develop germplasm for grain production and simultaneously mitigating climate change by allocating more carbon in soil.

AB  - Thermotolerant crop research. Global warming has become a serious worldwide threat. High temperature is a major environmental factor limiting crop productivity. Current adaptations to high temperature via alterations to technical and management systems are insufficient to sustain yield. For this reason, breeding for heat-tolerant crops is in high demand. This review provides an overview of the effects of high temperature on plant physiology, fertility and crop yield and discusses the strategies for breeding heat-tolerant cultivars. Generating thermotolerant crops seems to be a challenging task as heat sensitivity is highly variable across developmental stages and processes. In response to heat, plants trigger a cascade of events, switching on numerous genes. Although breeding has made substantial advances in developing heat-tolerant lines, the genetic basis and diversity of heat tolerance in plants remain largely unknown. The development of new varieties is expensive and time-consuming, and knowledge of heat tolerance mechanisms would aid the design of strategies to screen germplasm for heat tolerance traits. However, gains in heat tolerance are limited by the often narrow genetic diversity. Exploration and use of wild relatives and landraces in breeding can increase useful genetic diversity in current crops. Due to the complex nature of plant heat tolerance and its immediate global concern, it is essential to face this breeding challenge in a multidisciplinary holistic approach involving governmental agencies, private companies and academic institutions.

AB  - Many authors have blamed African land tenure systems for the poor agricultural production and environmental degradation in Africa, and therefore the resulting hunger, environmental refugees and the lack of socio-economic progress. The aim of this paper was to investigate the role of tenure security in north-east Ghana and the implications for agricultural production and environmental sustainability. The research used a mixture of qualitative and quantitative methods including interviews, focus group discussions and questionnaires to collect and analyse data from stakeholders in two selected districts in north-east Ghana The study revealed that contrary to the mainstream view that lack of security of customary land tenure is the main cause of the poor agricultural production and environmental degradation, stakeholders' perceptions of their security of tenure was generally high. Yet poor agricultural production and environmental degradation characterised the study area. Interviewees perceived the main causes to be due to non-tenurial factors including lack of finance, poor soil fertility, inadequate and unreliable rainfall, pests and diseases, inadequate farmlands, bush burning and excessive tree cutting. It was also shown in the study that women and strangers (i.e. non-community members) generally had little or no power and control over land use decision-making and management under customary land tenure. These findings have negative implications for tenure security and environmental sustainability in north-east Ghana, since most women are involved in food production. The paper concludes that current policy focus on enhancing tenure security may fail to lead to increased agricultural production and environmental sustainability if similar focus is denied the above non-tenurial factors. Tenure security is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for improvement in agricultural production and environmental management in north-east Ghana. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In recent history, Indonesian forest policies have been dominated by deforestation in the name of economic progress. Many actors have expressed concerns about this trend and have tried to reverse it in favour of a more sustainable pathway. From 2004-2017, non-governmental environmental organisations fought for the case of the coastal Tripa peat swamp rainforest in the province of Aceh, Sumatra. Unique in Indonesian history, they managed halting and reversing the deforestation of an area. Their sustained action led the Indonesia state to cancel an oil palm plantation permit, with the plantation managers and owners facing heavy fines and prison terms. Our research seeks to understand the enabling factors making this success story possible. We used the Advocacy Coalition Framework for its capacity to deal with a complicated policymaking ecosystem whose decisions takes years for implementation. Our analysis found four enabling conditions of success, which were the NGOs capacity to: 1) sustain action for over a decade and grasp four changing events (post-tsunami reconstruction, emerging connection between forests and climate change, governors' change, and use of digital technologies); 2) learn from own past failures marked by the evolution of their policy core beliefs, from 'conserving forest for biodiversity' to 'conserving forest for local livelihoods', and then to 'conserving forest to prevent climate change'. As a result, they could broaden their advocacy coalition, which grew to include diverse social actors from local to international levels, including the central state's REDD + Task Force; 3) take an advantage over economic power by acting strategically and timely when changes occurred; and 4) closely monitor and disseminate knowledge (fire events, deforestation trends and peat depth), supporting a simple causal deforestation model which allowed a high degree of policy oriented learning, helping the coalition to change its behaviour and act strategically. To sum up, the overall trend of rainforest destruction for agricultural extension in Southeast Asia, particularly in Sumatra, Indonesia, can be reversed, at least at the local level. Cautious not to overgeneralise, the Tripa case indicates that NGOs could improve forest governance by engaging in the long term, acting strategically, and building a broad socio-ecological and rights-based coalition.

AB  - Agriculture has both witnessed and caused climate change. Therefore, building climate resilience in the food production system is mandatory. Currently in Sri Lanka, recommended climate-smart agricultural practices recommend a common package to the entire country. However, considering the diversity that occurs across the country in every social, and ecological aspect it is essential to understand the cultural, ecological, and socioeconomic conditions of the country to determine more efficient agricultural practices to improve the resilience of the agricultural systems in a particular region. To achieve this objective, numerous traditional methods can be employed in modern farming strategies in order to make it more nature-friendly. Therefore, this literature review was developed to provide insights for the development of an evidence-based framework to enhance the climate resilience of Sri Lanka's agricultural systems. In that aspect, 36 scientific communications were considered over 13 years, using articles from the Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science databases (2010-2023). In addition, 4 country papers, and publications from the UN, ADB, FAO, and IPCC were cited. In this literature review article, the relationship between agriculture and climate change was identified. Then, the climate-resilient ability of traditional agriculture and its location specificity were reviewed. The status of climate resilience in the existing food system was analyzed considering the Batticaloa farming system as a case study. Finally, an appropriate location-specific framework was suggested to build climate resilience by integrating traditional farming techniques into modern agriculture. As per the results, rainwater harvesting strategies as cascade village tank system, management of limited water through practices as shared cultivation (Bethma govithena), shared responsibility (Pangukariya) for the maintenance of village tanks, dry seed paddy farming (Kekulam govithena), maintaining agro-biodiversity via, mixed cropping, agro-forestry, use of resistant crop varieties are the key Sri Lankan traditional agricultural practices which can be adapted to build the system resilience. These practices are developed based on the specific cultural, ecological, and socio-economic conditions of each region of the country. However, the establishment of micro-irrigation systems, utilizing early warning systems, development of high-yielding resistant crop varieties, crop-livestock integration, and cultivation of location-specific crop varieties are the main modern agricultural practices recommended to build up the climate resilience of the food systems. However, many of these recommended practices were exercised during the traditional agricultural systems as well. There are many other specific practices available that can be applied with modification even for present-day agriculture to enhance its climate resilience. Integrating the knowledge from traditional agriculture into modern agricultural practices will directly facilitate the achievement of three sustainable development goals of climate action, zero hunger, and no poverty through the development of regional-specific sustainable agricultural practices that restore the resilience of agriculture. Therefore, this literature review article proposes a framework for managing location-specific climate-resilient food systems on par with the regional agroecological and socioeconomic conditions of Sri Lanka.

AB  - The concept of resilience has been increasingly adopted on the European Union's (EU) policy agenda as a principle for agro-food policy-making. However, resilience is an ambiguous concept, allowing for different understandings and uses in the context of agro-food policy-making. This study analyses whether and how resilience is framed and contributes to framing in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) post-2020 reform process by policymakers and stakeholders. Combining deductive and inductive coding, we analysed 123 policy documents of EU institutions and stakeholders related to the CAP post-2020 reform debate and the associated Farm-to-Fork Strategy. Five distinct resilience frames were identified: (1) income resilience frame, (2) farmers' supply chain position resilience frame, (3) climate change impact resilience frame, (4) disease resilience frame and (5) ecological resilience frame. Whereas the resilience concept has been deployed by various actors, they differ in their preferred policy actions towards greater resilience.

AB  - Reducing tropical deforestation is potentially a large-scale and low-cost strategy for mitigating climate change. Yet previous efforts to project the cost-effectiveness of policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from future deforestation across the tropics were hampered by crude available data on historical forest loss. Here we use recently available satellite-based maps of annual forest loss between 2001-2012, along with information on topography, accessibility, protected status, potential agricultural revenue, and an observed inverted-U-shaped relationship between forest cover loss and forest cover, to project tropical deforestation from 2016-2050 under alternative policy scenarios and to construct new marginal abatement cost curves for reducing emissions from tropical deforestation. We project that without new forest conservation policies 289 million hectares of tropical forest will be cleared from 2016-2050, releasing 169 GtCO(2). A carbon price of US$20/tCO(2) ($50/tCO(2)) across tropical countries would avoid 41 GtCO(2) (77 GtCO(2)) from 2016-2050. By comparison, we estimate that Brazil's restrictive policies in the Amazon between 2004-2012 successfully decoupled potential agricultural revenue from deforestation and reduced deforestation by 47% below what would have otherwise occurred, preventing the emission of 5.2 GtCO(2). All tropical countries enacting restrictive anti-deforestation policies as effective as those in the Brazilian Amazon between 2004-2012 would avoid 58 GtCO(2) from 2016-2050.

AB  - Purchases of private land for conservation are common in California and represent an alternative to regulatory land-use policies for constraining land use. The retention or enhancement of ecosystem services may be a benefit of land conservation, but that has been difficult to document. The InVEST toolset provides a practical, low-cost approach to quantifying ecosystem services. Using the toolset, we investigated the provision of ecosystem services in Sonoma County, California, and addressed three related questions. First, do lands protected by the Sonoma County Agricultural Preservation and Open Space District (a publicly funded land conservation program) have higher values for four ecosystem services - carbon storage, sediment retention, nutrient retention and water yield - than other properties? Second, how do the correlations among these services differ across protected versus non-protected properties? Third, what are the strengths and weaknesses of using the InVEST toolset to quantify ecosystem services at the county scale? We found that District lands have higher service values for carbon storage, sediment retention and water yield than adjacent properties and properties that have been developed to more intensive uses in the last 10 years. Correlations among the ecosystem services differed greatly across land-use categories, and these differences were driven by a combination of soil, slope and land use. While InVEST provided a low-cost, clearly documented way to evaluate ecosystem services at the county scale, there is no ready way to validate the results.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Pediatric hospitals are adopting strategies to address food insecurity (FI), a stigmatizing condition, among families with children. We hypothesized that parents and other caregivers ("caregivers") from households with FI or marginal food security (MFS) are more likely to experience discrimination during their child's hospitalization.METHODS We analyzed data from 319 caregivers of children admitted to an urban, academic children's hospital and randomly assigned to the control arm of the double-blind randomized controlled CommunityRx-Hunger trial (November 2020 to June 2022, NCT R01MD012630). Household food security in the 30 days before admission and discrimination during hospitalization were measured with the US Household Food Security Survey and the Discrimination in Medical Settings Scale, respectively. We used logistic regression to model the relationship between food security status and discrimination, adjusting for gender, race, ethnicity, income, and partner status.RESULTS Most participants were African American or Black (81.5%), female (94.7%), and the parent of the hospitalized child (93.7%). FI and MFS were prevalent (25.1% and 15.1%, respectively). Experiences of discrimination during a child's hospitalization were prevalent (51.9%). Caregivers with FI had higher odds than caregivers with food security of experiencing discrimination (adjusted odds ratio = 2.0, 95% confidence interval 1.1-3.6, P = .03); MFS was not significantly associated with discrimination (P = .25). Compared with food secure caregivers, those with FI had higher odds of 5 of 7 experiences of discrimination assessed.CONCLUSIONS Among parents and other caregivers, household FI is associated with experiences of discrimination during a child's hospitalization.

AB  - Forestation is important for sequestering atmospheric carbon, and it is a cost-effective and nature-based solution (NBS) for mitigating global climate change. Here, under the assumption of forestation in the potential plantable lands, we used the forest carbon sequestration (FCS) model and field survey involving 3365 forest plots to assess the carbon sequestration rate (CSR) of Chinese existing and new forestation forests from 2010 to 2060 under three forestation and three climate scenarios. Without considering the influence of extreme events and human disturbance, the estimated average CSR in Chinese forests was 0.358 +/- 0.016 Pg C a-1, with partitioning to biomass (0.211 +/- 0.016 Pg C a-1) and soil (0.147 +/- 0.005 Pg C a-1), respectively. The existing forests account for approximately 93.5% of the CSR, which will peak near 2035, and decreasing trend was present overall after 2035. After 2035, effective tending management is required to maintain the high CSR level, such as selective cutting, thinning, and approximate disturbance. However, new forestation from 2015 in the potential plantable lands would play a minimal role in additional CSR increases. In China, the CSR is generally higher in the Northeast, Southwest, and Central-South, and lower in the Northwest. Considering the potential losses through deforestation and logging, it is realistically estimated that CSR in Chinese forests would remain in the range of 0.161-0.358 Pg C a-1 from 2010 to 2060. Overall, forests have the potential to offset 14.1% of the national anthropogenic carbon emissions in China over the period of 2010-2060, significantly contributing to the carbon neutrality target of 2060 with the implementation of effective management strategies for existing forests and expansion of forestation.

AB  - Food production is the basis for ensuring human survival. Ecological compensation for arable land is important to ensure the sustainable use of arable land and food production. However, how is it possible to set the standard of ecological compensation and how to achieve it scientifically? In this paper, we take China as the study area and link the ecological compensation of arable land with the production, circulation and consumption of three staple foods. The amount of food is converted into the area of arable land needed to produce that food. After calculating the value of ecosystem services that support food production on arable land, the ecological compensation standard is obtained, and the realization mode between regions is constructed. The results show that: (1) the flow of staple foods in China is mainly from north to south and the value of arable land support services provided by northern provinces is greater than that of southern provinces; (2) the province that needs to pay the most ecological compensation for cultivated land is Guangdong Province, with an amount of yen 16.082 billion RMB, and the province that receives the most compensation is Heilongjiang Province, with an amount of yen 21.547 billion RMB; (3) in order to coordinate the collection and distribution of ecological compensation in each province, it is necessary to establish an ecological compensation fund for arable land in the central government. Protecting the ecological status of arable land and ensuring sustainable food production is in the overall interest of the country.

AB  - Digital agriculture solutions hold a promise to build agri-food food systems that are more efficient, environmentally sustainable, and inclusive, thereby contributing to the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals. In most African countries, the rapid adoption of mobile phones and other digital tools have accelerated the deployment of agricultural services for farmers and other value chain actors resulting in enhanced access to information, knowledge, financial services, markets, and farm tools. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has provided a unique opportunity to fast-track the deployment of contact-free digital solutions along the agri-food value chains. Despite the numerous opportunities presented by the digital agricultural revolution, its potential to transform agri-food systems in Africa remains uncertain. With a broad perspective on Africa, this paper explores the emerging evidence on digital agricultural services including key drivers, evidence on impact, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper concludes with some implications for policy makers and professionals in agricultural economics.

AB  - There is a new trend toward public supply chain-related laws which demand information from companies on imported products. The European Union's (EU) Renewable Energy Directive (RED) and Timber Regulation (EUTR) exemplify this new type of law. In both cases, companies have to prevent deforestation in their supply chains. The Democratic Republic of the Congo and Indonesia, both among those countries with the world's highest deforestation rates, support supply chain laws on paper, but there are serious implementation deficits in practice. Using a tripartite framework developed by Cashore and Stone, our study addresses this alleged contradiction and explains deficits inherent in the laws based on the analysis of policy documents, expert in-terviews and field research. We find that companies take advantage of opportunities to shift exports to less regulating countries. EU member states exercise their purchasing power too cautiously over intermediary (manufacturing) countries in the supply chain, especially China. Finally, despite possibilities of public action, sanctioning is largely left to the private sector.

AB  - Ensuring food security in China is the primary task in solving the problems of 'agriculture, countryside, and farmers'. Based on Chinese provincial panel data from 2009 to 2018, this paper evaluates the impact of a water rights trading pilot policy (WRTPP) on food security and examines its underlying mechanism. To overcome the estimation bias existing in previous studies, we use the difference-in-differences method, which can separate time effects from policy treatment effects and is an effective tool to compare the effect before and after policy implementation. We, therefore, use this method to evaluate the net effect of the WRTPP on food security. It is found that the WRTPP can help ensure food security. This effect reaches its maximum in the fourth year after the policy's implementation. It is further found that the WRTPP can improve the adoption of agricultural water-saving irrigation technology to increase the grain yield. Our conclusions complement existing evidence on the factors influencing food security. From the perspective of improving farmers' water-saving irrigation technology, we confirm that the mechanism of the water right trading pilot policy helps ensure food security.

AB  - To explore the impact of land-use change on carbon storage, this study coupled the InVEST model and the FLUS model to analyse the spatial and temporal characteristics of carbon storage in the Qiantang River source region from 2000 to 2030. The carbon storage in the study area is evaluated which declined rapidly from 166.22 x 10(6) t in 2000 to 164.41 x 10(6) t in 2020, and the spatial distribution of carbon storage could be characterized by "the northwest and the southwest of region with higher, the east and the centre of the region with lower". The carbon storage was simulated based on the historical trend development scenario, the food security scenario, and the ecological protection scenario. The carbon storage with the food security scenario could achieve 162.74 x 10(6) t in 2030. The carbon storage with the ecological protection scenario had an increase of 62.60 t/km(2) compared to the historical natural tendency development. Interestingly, the food security scenario had the smallest carbon loss value which is about $1.39 x 10(9), and its net carbon storage value was the largest which is about $3.71 x 10(9). The results of this study could provide a scientific reference for the conservation of carbon storage and land use management for climate change and sustainable development. This paper also can lay the foundation for subsequent further studies such as artificial intelligence.

AB  - Despite being some of the most important crops globally, there has been limited research on forages when compared with cereals, fruits, and vegetables. This review summarizes the literature highlighting the significance of forage crops, the current improvements and some of future directions for improving yield and nutritional quality. We make the point that the knowledge obtained from model plant and grain crops can be applied to forage crops. The timely development of genomics and bioinformatics together with genome editing techniques offer great scope to improve forage crops. Given the social, environmental and economic importance of forage across the globe and especially in poorer countries, this opportunity has enormous potential to improve food security and political stability.

AB  - International initiatives for reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) could make critical, cost-effective contributions to tropical countries' nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Norway, a key donor of such initiatives, had a REDD+ partnership with Indonesia, offering results-based payments in exchange for emissions reductions calculated against a historical baseline. Central to this partnership was an area-based moratorium on new oil palm, timber, and logging concessions in primary and peatland forests. We evaluate the effectiveness of the moratorium between 2011 and 2018 by applying a matched triple difference strategy to a unique panel dataset. Treated dryland forest inside moratorium areas retained, at most, an average of 0.65% higher forest cover compared to untreated dryland forest outside the moratorium. By contrast, carbon-rich peatland forest was unaffected by the moratorium. Cumulative avoided dryland deforestation from 2011 until 2018 translates into 67.8 million to 86.9 million tons of emissions reductions, implying an effective carbon price below Norway's US$5 per ton price. Based on Norway's price, our estimated cumulative emissions reductions are equivalent to a payment of US$339 million to US$434.5 million. Annually, our estimates suggest a 3 to 4% contribution to Indonesia's NDC commitment of a 29% emissions reduction by 2030. Despite the Indonesia-Norway partnership ending in 2021, reducing emissions from deforestation remains critical for meeting this commitment. Future area-based REDD+ initiatives could build on the moratorium's outcomes by reforming its incentives and institutional arrangements, particularly in peatland forest areas.

AB  - The collapse of socialism in 1989 triggered a phase of institutional restructuring in Central and Eastern Europe. Several countries chose to privatize forests or to return them to pre-socialist owners. Here, we assess the implications of forest restitution on the terrestrial carbon balance. New forest owners have strong incentives to immediately clearcut their forests, resulting in increased terrestrial emissions. On the other hand, logging generally decreased after 1989 and forests are expanding on unused or abandoned farmland, both of which may offset increased logging on restituted forests. We mapped changes in forest cover for the entire country of Romania using Landsat satellite images from 1990 to 2010. We use our satellite estimates, together with historic data on logging rates and changes in forest cover, to parameterize a carbon book-keeping model for estimating the terrestrial carbon flux (above and below ground) as a consequence of land use change and forest harvest. High logging rates during socialism resulted in substantial terrestrial carbon emissions and Romania was a net carbon source until the 1980s. After the collapse of the Soviet Union forest harvest rates decreased dramatically, but since restitution laws were implemented they have increased by 60% (from 15 122 +/- 5397 ha y(-1) in 2000 to 23 884 +/- 11 510 ha y(-1) in 2010), but still remain lower than prior to 1989. Romania currently remains a terrestrial carbon sink, offsetting 7.6% +/- 2.5% of anthropogenic carbon emissions. A further increase in logging could result in net emissions from terrestrial ecosystems during the coming decades. However, forest expansion on degraded land and abandoned farmland offers great potential for carbon sequestration.

AB  - Among the recent line of technological innovations, nanotechnology takes a promising position in agriculture and food production. Nanotechnology permits definite advances in agricultural research, such as reproductive science and technology. This investigation is interested in studying the in vitro effect of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on callus, embryogenesis, embryo germination and elongation as well as rooting stage of date palm. Carbon nanotubes concentrations were investigated as 0.0, 0.05 and 0.1 mg/l. Results showed that CNTs affect all stages of micropropagation of date palm. Callus fresh weight showed the optimum value at 0.05 mg/l. In embryogenesis stage, CNTs decreased the number of embryos compared with the control while, increased number of germinated embryos and root number. Carbon nanotubes gave a significant enhancement for shoot length and leaf number in elongation stage. Similarly, it enhanced root number, root length, plantlet length and hairy roots. Chemical analysis as chlorophyll a, b, carotenoids, flavonoids, antioxidant enzymes and nutrients concentration and uptake were determined.

AB  - To date, only few studies have compared the soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration potential between perennial woody and herbaceous crops. The main objective of this study was to assess the effect of perennial woody (poplar, black locust, willow) and herbaceous (giant reed, miscanthus, switchgrass) crops on SOC stock and its stabilization level after 6years from plantation on an arable field. Seven SOC fractions related to different soil stabilization mechanisms were isolated by a combination of physical and chemical fractionation methods: unprotected (cPOM and fPOM), physically protected (iPOM), physically and chemically protected (HC-mu s+c), chemically protected (HC-ds+c), and biochemically protected (NHC-ds+c and NHC-mu s+c). The continuous C input to the soil and the minimal soil disturbance increased SOC stocks in the top 10cm of soil, but not in deeper soil layers (10-30; 30-60; and 60-100cm). In the top soil layer, greater SOC accumulation rates were observed under woody species (105 g m(-2) yr(-1)) than under herbaceous ones (71 g m(-2) yr(-1)) presumably due to a higher C input from leaf-litter. The conversion from an arable maize monoculture to perennial bioenergy crops increased the organic C associated to the most labile organic matter (POM) fractions, which accounted for 38% of the total SOC stock across bioenergy crops, while no significant increments were observed in more recalcitrant (silt- and clay-sized) fractions, highlighting that the POM fractions were the most prone to land-use change. The iPOM fraction increased under all perennial bioenergy species compared to the arable field. In addition, the iPOM was higher under woody crops than under herbaceous ones because of the additional C inputs from leaf-litter that occurred in the former. Conversion from arable cropping systems to perennial bioenergy crops can effectively increase the SOC stock and enlarge the SOC fraction that is physically protected within soil microaggregates.

AB  - Based on the perspective of carbon sequestration, this paper selects county-level panel data from China from 2000 to 2017 and uses a Difference-in-Differences (DID) Model to examine the impact of the high-standard basic farmland construction (HSFC) on the enhancement of regional carbon sequestration capacity. The results indicate that the HSFC policy enhances the carbon sequestration capacity in the respective areas. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that counties with more significant promotion and implementation of HSFC exhibit substantially better local carbon sequestration capacity compared to those that were early pilot areas. Non-grain-producing counties with smaller agricultural production scales exhibit better carbon sequestration effects when implementing the HSFC policy compared to grain-producing counties. HSFC also shows varying carbon sequestration effects in different regions of cropping systems. Further analysis reveals that the improvement in agricultural mechanization and the reduction in fertilizer application can effectively enhance the carbon sequestration effects of the HSFC policy. Moreover, HSFC has significant policy spillover effects that can enhance agricultural carbon sequestration levels in neighboring regions.

AB  - The emission of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, and the consequent potential for climate change are the focus of increasing international concern. Temporary land-use change and forestry projects (LUCF) can be implemented to offset permanent emissions of carbon dioxide from the energy sector. Several approaches to accounting for carbon sequestration in LUCF projects have been proposed. In the present paper, the economic implications of adopting four of these approaches are evaluated in a normative context. The analysis is based on simulation of Australian farm-forestry systems. Results are interpreted from the standpoint of both investors and landholders. The role of baselines and transaction costs are discussed.

AB  - Soil Health refers to the ecological equilibrium and the functionality of a soil and its capacity to maintain a well balanced ecosystem with high biodiversity above and below surface, and productivity. To understand and use soil health as a tool for sustainability, physical, chemical, and biological properties must be employed to verify which respond to the soil use and management within a desired timescale. Attributes with a rapid response to natural or anthropogenic actions are considered good indicators of soil health. Among the physical indicators, soil texture, aggregation, moisture, porosity, and bulk density have been used, while among chemical indicators total C and N, mineral nutrients, organic matter, cation exchange capacity, among others are well established. However, most of them generally have a slow response, when compared to the biological ones, such as microbial biomass C and N, biodiversity, soil enzymes, soil respiration, etc., in addition to macro and mesofauna. Thus, a systemic approach based on different kinds of indicators (physical,. chemical and biological) in assessing soil health would be safer than using only one kind of attribute. Many human activities have caused desertification, loss of biodiversity, disruption of aggregates, loss of organic matter and nutrients, among others. Today, it is imperious to maintain soil health and productivity with increasing emphasis on reforestation and recuperation of degraded areas through the use of organic amendments, reintroduction of plants, soil fauna and microorganisms. This review focused on an integrative view on indicators of soil health to be used as tools for prediction of sustainability in production systems.

AB  - Cultivated species diversity can provide numerous benefits to agricultural systems. Many ecological theories have been proposed to understand the relationships between plant species diversity and trophic interactions. However, extending such theories to socioeconomic systems has been rare for agriculture. Here, we establish ten hypotheses (e.g., the natural enemy hypothesis, resource concentration hypothesis, insurance hypothesis, and aggregation hypothesis) about the relationships between cultivated species diversity (i.e., crop diversification, co-cultures of crops and domestic animals, and co-cultures of crops and edible fungi) and trophic cascades of crops, invertebrate herbivores and natural enemies in cropping systems. We then explore the socioeconomic advantages (e.g., yield, economic and environmental performance) of these trophic cascades. Finally, we propose a multi-perspective framework to promote the cascading social-ecological benefits of species diversity for agricultural sustainability. Integrating the benefits of trophic cascades into agricultural socioeconomic systems requires policies and legislation that support multi-species co-culture practices and the willingness of consumers to pay for these practices through higher prices for agricultural products.

AB  - Biochars are emerging eco-friendly products showing outstanding properties in areas such as carbon sequestration, soil amendment, bioremediation, biocomposites, and bioenergy. These interesting materials can be synthesized from a wide variety of waste-derived sources, including lignocellulosic biomass wastes, manure and sewage sludge. In this work, abundant data on biochars produced from coconut-shell wastes obtained from the Colombian Pacific Coast are presented. Biochar synthesis was performed varying the temperature (in the range: 280 degrees C-420 degrees C) and O-2 feeding (in the range: 0-5% v/v) in the pyrolysis reaction. Production yields and some biochar properties such as particle size, Zeta Potential, elemental content (C, N, Al, B, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Na, P, S, Ti, Zn), BET surface area, FT-IR spectrum, XRD spectrum, and SEM morphology are presented. This data set is a comprehensive resource to gain a further understanding of biochars, and is a valuable tool for addressing the strategic exploitation of the multiple benefits they have.

AB  - CONTEXT: For arable crops, weeds are the most harmful pests among those targeted by pesticides. They are also crucial sources of plant biodiversity in agricultural landscapes, and host and feed wild fauna. As there is, to date, no curative weed control method as effective as herbicides, reducing herbicide use while limiting the damage to crop production requires combining many partially-efficient cultural practices at the cropping-system scale.OBJECTIVE: The objectives were to (1) compare the performances and applicability of cropping systems obtained with three contrasting design approaches, aiming at reducing weed harmfulness for crop production and her-bicide use, (2) identify the technical determinants of a more sustainable weed management. The design ap-proaches were: (1) de novo design by diverse experts working in five regions, (2) step-by-step improvement of a series of farmers' cropping systems from a single production context over several years; (3) farmer-centred design of one current cropping system by one group of farmers with weed issues, helped with a board game (Mission Ecophyt'eau (R)) and a decision-support system to evaluate weed impacts (DECIFLORSYS).METHODS: We assessed (1) weed impacts on crop production and biodiversity by simulating current and innovative cropping systems with the FLORSYS model over 30 years and with 10 weather scenarios, (2) sustain -ability by scoring the economic, social and environmental performances of all systems with the multicriteria evaluation tool DEXiPM. To account for production context, we assessed the differences in indicator values between innovative and current cropping systems ("trajectories"). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The trajectories showed no trade-off between weed harmfulness for crop pro-duction and herbicide use intensity. Reduced herbicide use (-1.0 Treatment Frequency Index) was compensated by combining alternative levers targeting weed prevention, particularly crop diversification (+ 3 to 5 new crops on average) and tillage. Changes in weed impacts were greater with expert design than with the two farmer -design approaches. However, social sustainability from farmers' perspective mostly decreased with expert design (6 trajectories out of 9). Moreover, the best trajectories for reconciling low weed harmfulness and low herbicide use with higher sustainability were obtained by farmers after 10 years of step-by-step design (2 tra-jectories out of 30). SIGNIFICANCE: The use of models, board games and decision-support systems in the two farmers' groups showed that bringing new knowledge in different ways is essential to actually change cropping systems. Implicating farmers early in the design process also improved the likelihood to adopt the designed cropping system.

AB  - Genebanks underpin global food security, conserving and distributing agrobiodiversity for use in research and breeding. The CGIAR collections include >700,000 seed accessions, held in trust as global public goods. However, the role of genebanks in contributing to global food security can only be realized if collections are effectively managed. Examination of the historical viability monitoring data from seven CGIAR genebanks confirmed that high seed viability was maintained for many decades for the various crops and forage species. However, departures from optimum management procedures were revealed, and there were insufficient data gathered to derive reliable estimates of longevity needed to better forecast regeneration requirements, estimate the size of seed lots that should be stored, and optimize accession monitoring intervals.

AB  - Background: The use of grains as an alternative to wheat in breadmaking has rapidly grown in the last few years, driven by the Sustainable Development Goals toward improving food security and promoting sustainable agriculture. Flours from legumes, pseudo-cereals, minor cereals and milling by-products, such as bran, are of particular interest. The production of partially substituted or wheat-free bread is, however, a challenging task in terms of texture and flavour attributes. Scope and approach: The present review covers recent advances in the application of dextrans in improving dough rheology, baking performance and bread flavour characteristics. Emphasis has been given to in situ application of dextran via sourdough technology as a 'clean label' alternative to commercial hydrocolloid additives. Key findings and conclusions: In-situ dextran production leads to bread with higher specific volume, softer crumbs and increased moisture content. Dextran also provides an anti-staling effect attributable to its ability to reduce water mobility and retard starch retrogradation. A structure-function relationship has suggested that dextran with high molecular weight and less branching is superior in enhancing bread quality. Furthermore, mild acidification favours the functionality of dextran in dough and bread systems, while intensive acidification results in adverse effects. Lactic acid bacterial strains belonging to the genus Weissella exhibiting mild acidification are therefore appreciated in regard to the utilisation of in-situ produced dextran. This review highlights the novel application of dextran as a flavour masking agent to minimise off-flavours (e.g. beany flavour, bitter taste, and aftertaste) originating from non-wheat grains, consequently improving the acceptability of the final products.

AB  - A methodological characteristic of the REDD+ scheme is that it attempts to reduce deforestation by rewarding communities that change problematic land use practices. This has led to discussions on benefit sharing. This article focuses on incentives for alternative land use practices among village members living in frontier areas, especially in relation to support for sustainable land use and people's livelihoods, and clarifies the issues that REDD+ projects are likely to face in this context. Although some documents regarding REDD+ projects have mentioned support to encourage such incentives, insufficient consideration has been given to the realities of the changes in frontier communities. REDD+ projects are unlikely to motivate members to embrace alternative land use practices if support or benefit sharing does not match members' expectations. Here, we examine the changes in household (HH) income and structure, as well as in livelihood activities, experienced by Cambodian frontier villagers living at the site of a planned REDD+ project. During the nine years compared in this study, the frontier villages experienced broad and imbalanced changes in HH income owing to the rapid expansion of the cultivation of cash crops. Our results indicate that benefit sharing or support inevitably becomes more difficult and challenging in frontier areas than in areas where subsistence production systems still predominate, although such frontiers could, in theory, yield maximum returns with regard to forest carbon balance if the REDD+ projects addressed benefit sharing and support and came to fruition.

AB  - Increasing awareness of the issue of deforestation and degradation in the tropics has resulted in efforts to monitor forest resources in tropical countries. Advances in satellite-based remote sensing and ground-based technologies have allowed for monitoring of forests with high spatial, temporal and thematic detail. Despite these advances, there is a need to engage communities in monitoring activities and include these stakeholders in national forest monitoring systems. In this study, we analyzed activity data (deforestation and forest degradation) collected by local forest experts over a 3-year period in an Afromontane forest area in southwestern Ethiopia and corresponding Landsat Time Series (LTS). Local expert data included forest change attributes, geo-location and photo evidence recorded using mobile phones with integrated GPS and photo capabilities. We also assembled LTS using all available data from all spectral bands and a suite of additional indices and temporal metrics based on time series trajectory analysis. We predicted deforestation, degradation or stable forests using random forest models trained with data from local experts and LTS spectral-temporal metrics as model covariates. Resulting models predicted deforestation and degradation with an out of bag (OOB) error estimate of 29% overall, and 26% and 31% for the deforestation and degradation classes, respectively. By dividing the local expert data into training and operational phases corresponding to local monitoring activities, we found that forest change models improved as more local expert data were used. Finally, we produced maps of deforestation and degradation using the most important spectral bands. The results in this study represent some of the first to combine local expert based forest change data and dense LTS, demonstrating the complementary value of both continuous data streams. Our results underpin the utility of both datasets and provide a useful foundation for integrated forest monitoring systems relying on data streams from diverse sources.

AB  - The stable development of agriculture is related to the national economy, and the fragility and foundation of agricultural production determine the inherent requirements of the government for financial support of agriculture. Based on China's policy of agricultural subsidy, in this study, the basic characteristics and classification methods of agricultural subsidies are analyzed, and an evaluation model of agricultural subsidies is established based on a combined algorithm, where the attributes of agricultural subsidies are screened by analytic hierarchy process, and the evaluation process of agricultural subsidies is constructed by data envelopment approach. Moreover, the development level of regional financial subsidies for agriculture is measured by relative efficiency value, and the implementation direction of financial subsidies is evaluated, to enhance the administrative benefits of government finance and deepen the supply-side reform of agricultural financial subsidies, which promote the sustainable development of agricultural insurance and agricultural production.

AB  - Food security has become a topic of great concern in many countries. Global food security depends heavily on agriculture that has access to proper resources and best practices to generate higher crop yields. Crops, as with other plants, have a variety of strategies to adapt their growth to external environments and internal needs. In plants, the distal organs are interconnected through the vascular system and intricate hierarchical signaling networks, to communicate and enhance survival within fluctuating environments. Photosynthesis and carbon allocation are fundamental to crop production and agricultural outputs. Despite tremendous progress achieved by analyzing local responses to environmental cues, and bioengineering of critical enzymatic processes, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms underlying carbon assimilation, allocation, and utilization. This review provides insights into vascular-based systemic regulation of photosynthesis and resource allocation, thereby opening the way for the engineering of source and sink activities to optimize the yield performance of major crops.

AB  - Urinary nitrogen concentration (UNcc) and urinary N excretion (UN) are directly associated with the nitrogen (N) leaching potential of soil and greenhouse gas emissions from grazing ruminants' urine patches. This study was carried out to examine the effects of feeding cut plantain (PL) and perennial ryegrass-white clover pasture (PW) on dairy heifer feed and water intake, apparent nutrient digestibility and N excretion in urine. Twelve Jersey-Friesian heifers aged 9-10 months with an average body weight of 200 +/- 18.8 kg (mean +/- standard deviation (SD)) and breeding worth of NZ$162 +/- 16.9 (mean +/- SD) were randomly allocated to one of two treatments (six heifers per treatment): PW and PL. No difference was observed in dry matter intake (P = 0.117) and N intake (P = 0.370) between PW- and PL-fed heifers. The dry matter digestibility and digestible organic matter in the dry matter were similar between PL- and PW-fed heifers (P > 0.05). Heifers consuming PL had lower UNcc and UN than those consuming PW (P < 0.01). Estimated urine volume and total water intake were higher for PL-fed heifers than those fed PW (P < 0.01). Further, in comparison with PW-fed heifers, PL-fed heifers had lower plasma urea N (P < 0.001) and tended to have lower plasma delta N-15 feed delta N-15 (P = 0.086). The findings suggest that feeding FL to dairy heifers may reduce UNcc and UN in comparison with those on conventional pastures; therefore it provides an opportunity to mitigate on-farm N pollution.

AB  - Natural capital serves as a major constraint that affects the sustainable development of mountainous plateau areas. Determining ecological carrying capacity (ECC), as the key to measuring the critical natural capital of cropland, is needed for sustainable development. This study aims to provide new insights into ECC by diagnosing whether human activities are within the allowable range of natural capital and whether the spatial allocation of natural capital is reasonable in such specific areas. Taking Yunnan Province, China as the study area, we proposed an improved Ecological Footprint (EF) model to evaluate cropland's ecological capacity (CEC), and then, a framework of balance evaluation and spatial optimal allocation was constructed to examine the cropland's allowable range and optimize its spatial allocation if found unreasonable. Results show the following. (1) The per capita CEC of Yunnan Province between 2009 and 2016 decreased from 0.103 ha/capita to 0.095 ha/capita, and the cropland ecological balance index (EBI) presented a "critical overload" state ranging from 0.433 to 0.463, at which the supply exceeded the demand. Hence, the cropland was not within the allowable range in terms of supply-demand balance. (2) The comprehensive Gini coefficient of CEC was 0.462-0.515, and the gravity center of ca . deviated from the geometric center and shifted toward the westward, thereby, at is neither balanced in terms of spatial allocation nor coordinated with the population, economy, and resource environment. (3) The spatial allocation pattern of the study area was grouped into five zones on the basis of the optimization model. These zones are key optimization zone, adjustment optimization zone, maintenance zone, reasonable reduction zone, and key reduction zone. Accordingly, the targeted and differentiated strategies were accordingly put forward. Our study can contribute to identifying the practical approach to sustainable ecosystem management in mountainous plateau areas from the perspective of ECC and are beneficial for decision-making as regards new policies on cropland protection and Chinese ecological civilization construction.

AB  - The two major concerns of sustainable agriculture are safeguarding food security and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Studies on the performance of strip-till with controlled-release blended fertilizer on rainfed maize grain yield, greenhouse gas emissions, and net ecosystem economic budget are scarce in the hilly region of northeast China. In this study, the differences between strip-till (RST) and conventional ridge cropping (CP), straw off-field no-tillage (NT), and no-tillage with straw mulching (RNT) were comparatively investigated in the conventional fertilizer (Sd) mode. And meanwhile, four fertilization modes were also set up under strip-till (RST): conventional fertilization (Sd), controlled-release nitrogen fertilizer blended with normal urea 3:7 (30%Cr), controlled-release nitrogen fertilizer blended with normal urea 5:5 (50%Cr), and no-nitrogen fertilization. We analyzed maize yield, greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI), net income and net ecosystem economic budget (NEEB) for different treatments. The results showed that, under conventional fertilizer (Sd) mode, the maize yield of RST increased by 4.2%, 6.0% and 7.2% compared with NT, CP and RNT and the net income increased by 7.0%, 9.7% and 10.0%, respectively. Compared with CP and NT, although RST increased CO2 and N2O emissions, the GHGI of RST was not significantly different from CP and NT, and was 8.0% lower than that of RNT. The NEEB of RST increased by 6.8%, 9.7% and 11.0%, respectively, compared with NT, CP and RNT. Under strip-till, compared with 30%Cr and Sd, the yield of 50%Cr increased by 4.0% and 9.2% and the net income increased by 3.5% and 6.9%, respectively. There was no significant difference in GHGI between 50%Cr and 30%Cr, and 50%Cr decreased by 10.4% compared with Sd. The NEEB of 50%Cr increased by 3.8% and 7.4% compared to 30%Cr and Sd. Strip-till combines controlled-release nitrogen fertilizer blended with normal urea 5:5 (50%Cr) and can be applied as a sustainable strategy to improve the economic efficiency of maize and reduce environmental costs in the hilly region of northeast China.

AB  - Food security is one of the main conditions for the realization of national security and one of the pillars of economic development. This is especially important in developing countries that do not have adequate food security. Thus, the aim of this study is the mathematical analysis of the impact of macroeconomic variables on food security and its sub-indicators (access to food, economic ability to buy food, and food health) in 64 developing countries. For this purpose, the panel data approach and data of developing countries during the period 1996-2016 have been used. The results showed that GDPs of countries have a positive effect on food security so that all the three dimensions of food security improve with increasing income. Rising prices will reduce food security by reducing access to food and reducing purchasing power. Increase in the value-added agricultural sector by improving access to food improves food security and increase in urbanization in different dimensions has different effects on food security which ultimately reduces food security.

AB  - This study compares four selected environmental performance indicators for controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) and conventional production systems for tomatoes, strawberries, and lettuce. Data were obtained from 91 publications on life cycle inventory (LCI) and life cycle analysis (LCA) of open field, plasticulture, greenhouse, and vertical farm systems. We analyzed articles published from January 2000 to January 2023 that reported yields per land area, cumulative energy per functional unit (FU), global warming potential (GWP) per FU, and water use per FU for production systems of interest. We employed log-linear regressions for these four performance indicators and controlled for production system, organic production, and inclusion of post-farm gate impacts. The statistical analyses indicate that CEA production (greenhouse and vertical farms) have significantly higher yields, energy use and GWP than other production systems, although water use is significantly less. Our study suggests the need for greater homogeneity in performing LCA and reporting results. Research on the relative costs and scalability of CEA systems is less frequent yet are important to assess the contribution of these systems to food availability and access dimensions of food security.

AB  - The determinants and/or economic effects of modern food distribution channels have attracted much attention in previous research. Studies on the welfare consequences of modern channel options, however, have been sparse. Based on a broader definition of modern food distribution channels including midstream processors and downstream retailers (supermarkets, hypermarkets, brand-named retailers), this study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by exploring the distributional implications of farm households' choice of modern food distribution channels using a large and unique farm household dataset in Taiwan. Making use of the two-step control function approach, we identify the effect of modern food distribution options on farm households' profitability. The results reveal selling farm produce to modern food distributors does not produce a positive differential compared to the traditional outlets. Another dimension of farm household welfare affected by the choice of modern food distribution channel is income inequality. We apply the Lerman and Yitzhaki decomposition approach to gain a better understanding of the effect of the marketing channel option on the overall distribution of farm household income. The Gini decomposition of different income sources indicates that the choice of modern food distribution channels results in an inequality-equalizing effect among the farm households in Taiwan, suggesting the inclusion of smallholder farmers in the modern food distribution channels improves the overall welfare of the rural society.

AB  - Specialization may lead to higher income for small-scale farmers but comes with increased risks, while diversification can mitigate risks and foster agricultural sustainability. Considering the influences of complex risks and farmers' subjective risk aversion, the decision for small-scale farmers to specialize in citrus cultivation or diversify with multiple crops remains uncertain. There is currently limited understanding of this issue among citrus smallholders in rural China. This study aims to fill this empirical gap by examining the impact of smallholder farmers' subjective risk aversion on their choice between citrus monoculture and crop diversification. It utilizes a subjective risk assessment approach that incorporates farmers' risk perceptions and risk attitudes towards citrus farming. Farm crop diversification is assessed through the utilization of both the count index and Shannon index. The empirical analysis employs survey data obtained from citrus growers in Guangxi, China, and applies an instrumental variable regression method with endogeneity consideration using the IV-Probit model and 2SLS model estimation. The results reveal that both risk perceptions and risk attitudes play important roles in citrus smallholders' land allocation decisions. Specifically, citrus farmers who perceive higher risks and adopt risk-averse attitudes are statistically more inclined to engage in land use diversification practices, including the practice of growing citrus as well as other crops, which contributes to reducing the risks of citrus farming and promoting local environmental conservation. These results contribute to a better scholarly comprehension of the relationship between risk perceptions, risk attitudes, and crop diversification among small-scale citrus farmers. They provide valuable insights for enhancing the sustainability of land use systems with citrus farming while also emphasizing the importance of maintaining essential diversification in small-scale farming throughout the process of agricultural modernization.

AB  - This article explores the redistributive effects of classical horizontal inequities induced by agricultural policy. Within-farm type horizontal inequity is associated with differences in the level of support received by farms of a given type and level of pre-support income. Between-farm type horizontal inequity arises from systematic differences in support levels between commodity regimes. The overall redistributive effect of such inequities in Scottish agriculture is shown to be substantial, though systematic discrimination between farm types is not the major cause. The imperfect targeting of support revealed by the empirical findings has implications for the design of policy.

AB  - Land intensive grass-based dairy systems have the highest contribution to food security but may have a higher impact on the environment. The aim of this study was to classify dairy farms in terms of sustainable contribution to food security and analyze the farm characteristics related to these performances. To this end, we performed a sustainability assessment by calculating 17 indicators using FADN data of 209 Walloon (Belgium) dairy farms. Using the Analytical Hierarchy Process, 25 stakeholders of the Walloon milk upstream sector defined preference weights for the indicators. Farms were ranked using ELECTRE III using the mean weights for the dairy sector and grouped in four sustainability groups. A canonical discriminant analysis was performed on farm characteristics. Farm characteristics that negatively impact sustainability are the use of maize silage, the use of concentrates and the CP-content of these concentrates, the farm size, and the number of female followers per cow. The farm characteristic that positively impacts sustainability is the grassland yield. Milk production per cow, age at first calving, and calving interval have a negligible effect on sustainability. These results suggest that feed conversion efficiency is not a main driver of sustainability but rather that specific production means and practices play a more significant role in determining sustainability. Consequently, we argue that the search for efficiency that has been promoted to increase the sustainability of food systems should be placed in a systemic perspective in order to avoid trade-offs with other aspects and that, in general, an increase in efficiency is positively linked with sustainability when achieved through knowledge and technicity rather than by the addition of external inputs.

AB  - The conventional wheat-maize systems in the North China Plain are energy and water intensive with high carbon emissions. It is imperative to find cleaner production technologies for sustainable food-water-energycarbon synergism. Here, a three-year field experiment was performed to explore the effects of two tillage modes and four irrigation regimes during wheat season on crop yield, economic profile, water use efficiency, energy utilization, and carbon footprint in typical wheat-maize cropping systems in the North China Plain. Presowing irrigation resulted in the lowest crop yield and benefit profile. Pre-sowing + anthesis irrigation decreased economic benefit and water use efficiency with higher carbon footprint. Pre-sowing + jointing + anthesis irrigation led to the greatest energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. However, pre-sowing + jointing irrigation increased yield by 2.3-8.7%, economic benefit by 4.0-11.1%, water use efficiency by 7.4-10.9%, and net energy by 6.5-12.0% but reduced carbon footprint by 9.8-14.3% compared to pre-sowing + anthesis irrigation and pre-sowing + jointing + anthesis irrigation. The corresponding metrics in rotary tillage improved by 9.6%, 13.9%, 7.0%, and 14.2%, respectively, relative to subsoiling, whereas carbon footprint decreased by 12.4-17.2%. Besides, rotary tillage coupled with additional jointing irrigation obtained the highest value based on a Z-score method, which was recommended as a cleaner management practice to improve benefit return and water use efficiency with lower energy consumption and carbon footprint. This work provides valuable insights into food-water-energy-carbon nexus for ensuring food security and achieving environmental sustainability in the wheat-maize cropping systems.

AB  - Soil, an important component of land, has numerous functions and ecosystem services essential to all terrestrial life. Soil degradation, decline in its capacity to support functions and provide ecosystem services, is caused by accelerated erosion, salinization, elemental imbalance, acidification, depletion of soil organic carbon (SOC), reduction in soil biodiversity, and decline in soil structure and tilth. Desertification, a sub-set of degradation, specifically refers to decline in soil quality and functions in arid climates. Climate change affects and is affected by soil degradation through a positive feed back due to increase in mineralization of SOC pool and the radiative forcing. Desertification may lead to a net increase in temperature despite change in albedo of the denuded surface. Feedbacks and threshold amplify the risks of degradation, and the projected climate change may exacerbate all four types of drought (i.e., meteorological, hydrological, pedagogical, and ecological). The mutually reinforcing positive feedbacks between soil degradation and climate change are strongly influenced by social, economic, political, and cultural factors. There exists a strong link between poverty, desperateness, and societal collapse on soil degradation and climate change. Restoration of degraded and desertified soils, converting marginal agricultural areas to rangeland and forest land, and adoption of recommended management practices have a large technical potential to sequester carbon and off-set anthropogenic emissions, improve the environment, and enhance and sustain agronomic productivity. Important among recommended management practices are using conservation agriculture and mulch farming, establishing cover crops, adopting strategies of integrated nutrient management, and those which create positive C and nutrient budgets and soil/water conservation within a watershed. Long-term research is needed which is hypothesis-driven, uses modern innovative research and modeling tools, is based on community involvement, and provides decision support systems to policy makers and land managers.

AB  - Developing climate-resilient crops is critical for future food security and sustainable agriculture under current climate scenarios. Of specific importance are drought and soil salinity. Tolerance traits to these stresses are highly complex, and the progress in improving crop tolerance is too slow to cope with the growing demand in food production unless a major paradigm shift in crop breeding occurs. In this work, we combined bioinformatics and physiological approaches to compare some of the key traits that may differentiate between xerophytes (naturally drought-tolerant plants) and mesophytes (to which the majority of the crops belong). We show that both xerophytes and salt-tolerant mesophytes have a much larger number of copies in key gene families conferring some of the key traits related to plant osmotic adjustment, abscisic acid (ABA) sensing and signalling, and stomata development. We show that drought and salt-tolerant species have (i) higher reliance on Na for osmotic adjustment via more diversified and efficient operation of Na+/H+ tonoplast exchangers (NHXs) and vacuolar H+- pyrophosphatase (VPPases); (ii) fewer and faster stomata; (iii) intrinsically lower ABA content; (iv) altered structure of pyrabactin resistance/pyrabactin resistance-like (PYR/PYL) ABA receptors; and (v) higher number of gene copies for protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) and sucrose non-fermenting 1 (SNF1)-related protein kinase 2/open stomata 1 (SnRK2/OST1) ABA signalling components. We also show that the past trends in crop breeding for Na+ exclusion to improve salinity stress tolerance are counterproductive and compromise their drought tolerance. Incorporating these genetic insights into breeding practices could pave the way for more drought-tolerant and salt-resistant crops, securing agricultural yields in an era of climate unpredictability.

AB  - This study examined the climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices of dairy farmers in Agula and Maychew, Northern Ethiopia. Data was collected through focus group discussions (FGDs) and questionnaires. The study explored farmers', implementation of three CSA practices - improved fodder, manure management, and replacement of unproductive cows. The determinants of CSA adoption were analyzed using a binary logistics model at significance levels of 1%, 5%, and 10%. Results showed that improved fodder was adopted by 60.1% in Agula and 18.2% in Maychew. The adoption of manure management (p = .229) and replacement of unproductive cows (p = .935) did not vary significantly. The replacement of unproductive cows had the highest adoption rate (45.9%). Improved fodder adoption was significantly higher among male-headed farms (p = .017). Manure management adoption was positively associated with gender (p = .034), number of cows (p = .081), and access to climate information (p = .063). Replacement of unproductive cows was associated with number of cows (p < .001), farm income (p = .049), and access to extension services (p = .006). FGDs revealed that farmers were able to perceive climate change and its effects on their dairy business. This study underscores the need for CSA practices to adapt to climate change impact on animals and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from dairy farms.

AB  - Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) aims to transform and reorient farming systems to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, boost adaptive capacity, and improve productivity while supporting incomes and, ostensibly, food security. In Ghana-the world's second biggest cocoa producer-the cocoa sector is challenged by increasing global cocoa demand, climate change impacts, as well as mounting consumer pressure over cocoa's deforestation. Climate-smart cocoa (CSC) has emerged to address these challenges as well as to improve smallholder incomes. As with CSA more widely, there are concerns that CSC discourses will override the interests of cocoa smallholders, and lead to inequitable outcomes. To better understand if and how the implementation of CSC in Ghana can meet its lofty ambitions, we examine (1) the dominant CSC discourses as perceived by stakeholders, and their reflection in policy and practice, and (2) subsequent implications for cocoa smallholders through an equity lens. Through semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with key stakeholders in Ghana's cocoa sector, we find overwhelming consensus for an ecological modernisation discourse with the promise of a "triple win" narrative that simultaneously stops deforestation, supports climate mitigation and adaptation, and increases smallholder livelihoods. Moreover, we find that implementing CSC on the ground has generally converged around "sustainable intensification" and private-sector-led partnerships that aspire to generate a "win-win" for environment and productivity objectives, but potentially at the expense of delivering equitable outcomes that serve smallholders' interests. We find that the success of CSC and the overly-simplistic sustainable intensification narrative is constrained by the lack of clear tree tenure rights, complexities around optimal shade trees levels, potential rebound effects regarding deforestation, and the risks of agrochemical-dependence. More positively, local governance mechanisms such as Ghana's Community Resource Management Area Mechanisms (CREMAs) may give cocoa smallholders a stronger voice to shape policy. However, we caution that the discursive power of dominant private sector actors may risk side-lining equity which could prove detrimental to the long-term wellbeing of Ghana's similar to 800,000 cocoa smallholders.

AB  - Successfully meeting the mitigation and adaptation targets of the Paris Climate Agreement (PA) will depend on strengthening the ties between forests and agriculture. Climate-smart land use can be achieved by integrating climate-smart agriculture (CSA) and REDD+. The focus on agriculture for food security within a changing climate, and on forests for climate change mitigation and adaptation, can be achieved simultaneously with a transformational change in the land-use sector. Striving for both independently will lead to competition for land, inefficiencies in monitoring and conflicting agendas. Practical solutions exist for specific contexts that can lead to increased agricultural output and forest protection. Landscape-level emissions accounting can be used to identify these practices. Transdisciplinary research agendas can identify and prioritize solutions and targets for integrated mitigation and adaptation interventions. Policy coherence must be achieved at a number of levels, from international to local, to avoid conflicting incentives. Transparency must lastly be integrated, through collaborative design of projects, and open data and methods. Climate-smart land use requires all these elements, and will increase the likelihood of successful REDD+ and CSA interventions. This will support the PA as well as other initiatives as part of the Sustainable Development Goals.

AB  - Over three-fourths of Brazil's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions originate from land-use/cover change (LUCC). Alarming rates of forest loss in the Amazon region gained international attention in the past, but deforestation declined substantially since 2004 (although the rate has trended upwards since 2012). This result conforms to the GHG emission reduction targets set by the National Climate Change Plan, originally divided into three phases: 2006-2009; 2010-2013; and 2014-2017. According to the plan, emission reductions are measured against a deforestation baseline, initially corresponding to the average forest loss observed from 1996 to 2005 (reference period). We used an artificial neural network (ANN) model to spatialize the plan's original three-phase baseline and compare (i) the simulated carbon emissions from the baseline scenario to (ii) the emissions from observed deforestation during 2006-2017. Baseline spatialization was performed at the state level and informed by the 2000-2004 deforestation patterns in each state, resulting in nine state-specific calibrated ANNs. Simulated (baseline) and observed deforestation were compared to five biomass-density maps in order to estimate Brazil's GHG emission reductions. Our results indicate that forest loss during the study period was 62,321 km(2) lower than the baseline and associated with 1.5 +/- 0.4 Pg of avoided CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. Virtually all emission reductions (93%) occurred in the states of Mato Grosso (74%) and Rondonia (19%). In contrast, Roraima, Amazonas, and Amapa states increased GHG emissions by 44.8, 36.7, and 14.7 Tg CO2, respectively. Lastly, we discuss the issue of attribution of deforestation reductions for results-based payments (REDD+) and the emission reduction certificates issued by the Amazon Fund.

AB  - Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) is envisioned as a performance-based incentive to influence forest use behavior and governance towards the preservation and management of forests. In relatively forest-rich Lao PDR, the policy space that REDD+ planners are attempting to navigate is populated by enduring political and economic interests that affect the country's forest estate. A further layer to the problem of REDD+ planning is the tension between often expert-driven, externally proposed solutions; national ownership over interventions; and the extent of political will to take action to reform currently unsustainable patterns of forest and forest land exploitation. This paper draws from a series of semi-structured interviews conducted in 2013-2014, to develop a political and institutional analysis of the limitations to the effectiveness of REDD+ in steering towards a lower forest-derived emissions trajectory in Lao PDR. While internationally-driven projects follow long-standing national objectives to varying degrees, it remains unclear how REDD+ can target main drivers of deforestation in the absence of a more politically engaged and nationally-owned planning process, that also challenges the prevailing logic of avoiding these drivers. Despite the importance of improving domestic ownership over REDD+, this would arguably be of limited impact unless oriented towards transformational change that would seek to overcome political and economic barriers to avoided deforestation. Stronger ownership could be developed via more mutually driven REDD+ planning, while tackling main drivers of deforestation necessitates as a starting point the engagement of powerful actors that have so far been absent from REDD+ debate.

AB  - Opuntia ficus-indica (cactus pear) emerged as a promising crop for sustainable bioenergy production on marginal agricultural land, mitigating competition with food crops and lowering the risk of other indirect land use changes. In this study, the bioenergy potential is investigated of cactus pear residues within a smallholder farming context of Nopaltepec, a rural municipality in Central Mexico. Nopaltepec is a native environment of cactus pear and shows an annual production volume of 30 Gg of fresh matter. A bottom-up approach employing semi-structured interviews (n = 16) was utilized to assess the feasibility of transforming the pruning residues of cactus pear into a viable bioenergy source. The results indicate a substantial bioenergy potential, with 27 Mg of fresh matter biomass (equivalent to 9720 m3 biogas) per hectare obtainable annually without compromising fruit yields. Moreover, the digestate produced through anaerobic digestion can be recycled as biofertilizer, offering economic and ecological advantages to smallholders. Notably, farmers expressed keen interest in integrating this technology into their agricultural systems. This research underscores the potential of cactus pear residues for developing a decentralized bioenergy sector and provides valuable ideas for future bottom-up assessments in rural communities like Nopaltepec.

AB  - Increasing biomass allocation to the root system may increase soil-organic carbon stocks and confer drought adaptation in water-limited environments. Understanding the genetic bases and inheritance of biomass allocation is fundamental for drought tolerance breeding and soil health. The objective of this study was to determine the general and specific combining ability, maternal effects and the mode of gene action controlling the major yield and biomass allocation related traits in wheat to identify good combiners for breeding and enhanced carbon sequestration. Ten selected wheat genotypes were crossed in a full diallel mating design, and 90 F-2 families were generated and evaluated in the field and greenhouse under drought-stressed and non-stressed conditions. Significant differences were recorded among the tested families revealing substantial variation for plant height (PH), kernels per spike (KPS), root biomass (RB), shoot biomass (SB), total plant biomass (PB) and grain yield (GY). Additive gene effects conditioned PH, SB, PB and GY under drought, suggesting the polygenic inheritance for drought tolerance. Strong maternal and reciprocal genetic effects were recorded for RB across the testing sites under drought-stressed conditions. Line BW162 had high yield and biomass production and can be used to transfer favourable genes to its progeny. The parental line LM75 maintained the general combining ability (GCA) effects in a positive and desirable direction for SB, PB and GY. Early generation selection using PH, SB, PB and GY will improve drought tolerance by exploiting additive gene action under drought conditions. Higher RB production may be maintained by a positive selection of male and female parents to capture the significant maternal and reciprocal effects found in this study.

AB  - In this work, we advocate agroforestry as a sustainable agricultural method that leverages biodiversity and ecosystem services, simultaneously tackling the problems of adaptation and mitigation to climate change, and of land restoration for sustainable agriculture across scales. While the rise of industrial agriculture has been instrumental in addressing the food demands of an expanding global population, enhancing food quality, yield, productivity, and efficiency, we must now reckon with the consequences. This advancement, which prioritizes simplification, specialization, and external inputs, has escalated detrimental externalities including deforestation, biodiversity loss, soil degradation, pollution, and an increase in greenhouse gases, contributing significantly to global warming and to exacerbated environmental crises. These demand urgent attention. In response, various agricultural methodologies such as organic, biodynamic, ecological, and biological farming have emerged, attempting to propose alternatives. However, these methods have yet to significantly alter the trajectory of mainstream agriculture. For over two decades, we have devoted our efforts to developing and refining a multispecies integrated agroforestry system for the sustainable cultivation of Ilex paraguariensis, "yerba mate," in the subtropical north-east of Argentina. With "integrated" we mean that the trees are planted within the I. paraguariensis distribution, not between alleys as in "alley cropping" or "hedgrow intercropping." The experimental work we present here was designed and implemented to enable data comparisons across consociations of multiple species of trees, at a relevant experimental scale. We achieve soil preservation and restoration, productivity comparable to or exceeding monocultures, and a significant increase in resiliency, particularly evidenced during the extreme climate events of spring and summer 2021 and 2022. These results underscore agroforestry's potential for climate change mitigation and adaptation.

AB  - This study compared the energy efficiency and cost/benefit ratio of conventional and organic farming systems for black carrot (Daucus carota L.) in Konya province, Turkey. In the research, energy consumption for different farm operations from land preparation to transportation was considered. The farms were selected through stratified random sampling. Data were collected through field survey of 56 respondents in carrot farms during production periods in 2007-2008. Black carrot production was considered for the study as it is a very good source of colored food. Therefore, black carrot production must take into consideration the requirements for eco-design requirements and energy labeling. Based on the results, increasing amount of inputs was more effectively used in the organic farming system compared with the conventional system. Total energy requirement under conventional farming was 75,335.72 MJ ha(-1) and 37,758.82 MJ ha(-1) for organic farming. There was higher demand for energy in conventional farming (49.88%) than organic farming. On the other hand, the need for labor per hectare was higher for organic farming than for the conventional farming system. The energy output-input ratios for conventional and organic farming systems were 1.30 and 1.90, respectively. Moreover, the benefit-cost ratios were 1.83 and 2.05, respectively. Energy efficiency in the organic systems may increase by 1.32 kg ha(-1) and by 0.23 kg ha(-1) in the conventional systems.

AB  - Rhizosphere and root-associated bacteria are key components of crop production and sustainable agriculture. However, utilization of these beneficial bacteria is often limited by conventional culture techniques because a majority of soil microorganisms cannot be cultured using standard laboratory media. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to improve culturability and investigate the diversity of the bacterial communities from the wheat rhizosphere microbiome collected from three locations in Egypt with contrasting soil characteristics by using metagenomic analysis and improved culture-based methods. The improved strategies of the culture-dependent approach included replacing the agar in the medium with gellan gums and modifying its preparation by autoclaving the phosphate and gelling agents separately. Compared to the total operational taxonomic units (OTUs) observed from the metagenomic data sets derived from the three analyzed soils, 1.86 to 2.52% of the bacteria were recovered using the modified cultivation strategies, whereas less than 1% were obtained employing the standard cultivation protocols. Twenty-one percent of the cultivable isolates exhibited multiple plant growth-promoting (PGP) properties, including P solubilization activity and siderophore production. From the metagenomic analysis, the most abundant phyla were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes. Moreover, the relative abundance of the specific bacterial taxa was correlated with the soil characteristics, demonstrating the effect of the soil in modulating the plant rhizosphere microbiome. IMPORTANCE Bacteria colonizing the rhizosphere, a narrow zone of soil surrounding the root system, are known to have beneficial effects in improving the growth and stress tolerance of plants. However, most bacteria in natural environments, especially those in rhizosphere soils, are recalcitrant to cultivation using traditional techniques, and thus their roles in soil health and plant growth remain unexplored. Hence, investigating new culture media and culture conditions to bring "not-yet-cultured" species into cultivation and to identify new functions is still an important task for all microbiologists. To this end, we describe improved cultivation protocols that increase the number and diversity of cultured bacteria from the rhizosphere of wheat plants. Using such approaches will lead to new insights into culturing more beneficial bacteria that live in the plant rhizosphere, in so doing creating greater opportunities not only for field application but also for promoting sustainability.

AB  - Technological innovations in sustainable materials for soil improvement have attracted considerable interest due to energy crisis and environmental concerns in recent years. This study presents results of a comprehensive investigation on utilization of nanocarbons in reinforcement of a residual soil mixed with 0, 10 and 20% bentonite. Effects of adding proportionate quantities (0, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1 and 0.2%) of carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers to soil samples of different plasticities were evaluated. The investigation revealed that the inclusion of nanocarbons into the soil samples significantly improved unconfined compressive strength, Young's modulus and indirect tensile strength. It was observed that carbon nanofibers showed better performance as compared to carbon nanotubes. The nanosized diameter and high aspect ratio of nanocarbons make it possible to distribute the reinforcing materials on a much smaller scale and bridge the inter-particles voids. As a result, a better 'soil-reinforcing material' interaction is achieved and desired properties of the soil are improved at nanolevel.

AB  - This paper outlines a framework for studying the multiple interactions of broadly defined food systems with global environmental change and evaluating the major societal outcomes affected by these interactions: food security, ecosystem services and social welfare. In building the framework the paper explores and synthesizes disparate literature on food systems food security and global environmental change, bridging social science and natural science perspectives. This collected evidence justifies a representation of food systems, which can be used to identify key processes and determinants of food security in a given place or time, particularly the impacts of environmental change. It also enables analysis of the feedbacks from food system outcomes to drivers of environmental and social change, as well as tradeoffs among the food system outcomes themselves. In food systems these tradeoffs are often between different scales or levels of decision-making or management, so solutions to manage them must be context-specific. With sufficient empirical evidence, the framework could be used to build a database of typologies of food system interactions useful for different management or analytical purposes.

AB  - The role played by women in worldwide food production and food security has reinvigorated debates about the recognition of women's rights in the rural sector regarding better working conditions and the reduction of gender inequalities. In the 1980s, the social movement in Brazil restructured the politics in the agrarian sector by integrating farmers' rights and women's demands. Against this background, the objective of this study is to analyze, through the actors' perspectives, whether and how the combination of public policies for family farmers affected the socio-economic and political empowerment of women. Our case study covers family farmers from traditional communities located in the Brazilian semi-arid. The results show that women achieved economic stability by participating in public food procurement programmes. In addition, access to cisterns released women from the daily work of collecting water. Women became more involved with political issues, increasing participation in institutions such as NGOs, associations and cooperatives. Among the negative aspects, the study found that the sexual division of labor increased within the household context, and, despite being fundamental for ensuring household food security, women still struggle to have access to the means of production.

AB  - The land competition between tropical bioenergy plantations and payments for forest carbon conservation (e.g., through an international scheme for Reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, REDD+) is modeled using spatially explicit data on biofuel feedstock (oil palm and sugar cane) suitability and forest biomass carbon stocks. The results show that a price on the (avoided) carbon emissions from deforestation at the same level as those from fossil fuel use makes clearing for high yielding bioenergy crops unprofitable on about 60% of the tropical evergreen forest area. For the remaining 40% deforestation remains the most profitable option. Continued profitability of forest clearing is most pronounced for oil palm bioenergy systems in Latin America and Africa, with REDD+ making deforestation for sugar cane plantations unprofitable on 97% of evergreen forest land. Results are shown to be relatively robust to assumptions regarding potential yields and to the addition of a 'biodiversity premium' on land use change emissions. While REDD+ may play an important role in stemming biodiversity loss and reducing carbon emissions from tropical deforestation in the near future, in the longer run reliance on a system that values forests solely for their carbon retention capacities poses a serious risk. It is imperative that the institutions and policies currently being established as part of REDD+ readiness activities are resilient to future changes in the incentive structures facing tropical forest countries due to, e.g., climate policy induced demand for biofuels.

AB  - Climate change, land use change, and sociopolitical and institutional transitions in African drylands have resulted in the loss, fragmentation, and degradation of environmental resources that pastoralists rely upon to sustain their livestock-based livelihoods. Diversification into irrigated agriculture is a potential strategy to increase food security. However, successful livelihood adaptation depends on access to key forms of natural, human, social, financial, and physical capitals, which may be lacking or unequally distributed in pastoralist communities. In two dryland pastoralist communities in Kenya, an international relief organization introduced irrigated farming in 2010. Nearly 200 individuals began farming, but within 4 years, all had quit. This study investigated the role of household access to different forms of capital in decisions to adopt agriculture, and how adaptive capacities, environmental conditions, and farming as a new livelihood practice interacted to shape household vulnerability. We found that decisions to farm were largely decoupled from access to assets that would afford greater adaptive capacity. The analysis also identified critical constraints that households encountered once they adopted farming. This study highlights the importance of more nuanced understandings of local capacities in the dynamics of adapting to environmental change. We recommend that prior to introducing interventions that promote new livelihood activities, development organizations should assess local capacities and pursue targeted strategies to increase household-level access to the forms of assets that will facilitate successful adaptation.

AB  - Increased use of inorganic fertilizer in smallholder farming systems can significantly raise crop productivity, enabling farming households to improve their food security both directly, through greater food supply, and indirectly, though higher agricultural incomes, and to set themselves economically on a pathway out of poverty. Low fertilizer use by African smallholder farming households is evidence of the difficulties they face in accessing the commercial input at a price that will allow them to obtain sufficient and reliable returns from their investment. This paper presents the results of a broad study of fertilizer supply to smallholder farmers in Mozambique, Tanzania, and Uganda to assess whether costs faced at various points along the import and marketing chain, or the absence of key public goods and services, reduce the access that smallholder farmers have to fertilizer. The study involved a mixed methods approach that included for each country a review of the literature on fertilizer supply, demand, and use; interviews with key participants in fertilizer import and marketing; and two surveys - one with farmers and one with input suppliers. We found that the governments of the three countries have used distinct approaches in developing or regulating the fertilizer sub-sector. Based on use levels, Tanzania has been the most successful in ensuring access to fertilizer for its farmers. Mozambique lags the most. Several areas were identified where government inaction or misdirected efforts are having an adverse effect on efforts to increase agricultural productivity through the increased use of inorganic fertilizer. The most important constraints to increased fertilizer uptake stem from missing public goods that are not specific to inorganic fertilizer but are implicated in broad efforts to increase rural economic growth, particularly in continuing to expand and deepen crop output markets to ensure reliable returns to the use of fertilizer and in improving rural transportation networks. In addition, the three governments can do more to foster competitive agricultural input markets. All propose more state regulation on trade in inorganic fertilizer than is warranted. Moreover, particularly in Tanzania, by not consistently acting in line with policies for agricultural commercialization in place, government increases the commercial risks faced by both input suppliers and farmers and undermines the development of vibrant agricultural markets, both for inputs and outputs, including food.

AB  - The rationale for pesticide use in agriculture is that costs associated with pesticide pollution are to be justified by its benefits, but this is not so obvious. Valuing the benefits by simple economic analysis has increased pesticide use in agriculture and consequently produced pesticide-induced "public ills." This paper attempts to explore the research gaps of the economic and social consequences of pesticide use in developing countries, particularly with an example of Nepal. We argue that although the negative sides of agricultural development, for example- soil, water, and air pollution; pest resistance and resurgence; bioaccumulation, bio-magnification; and loss of biodiversity and ecosystem resilience caused by the use of pesticides in agriculture, are "developmental problems" and are "unintentional," the magnitude may be increased by undervaluing the problems in the analysis of its economic returns. Despite continuous effort for holistic system analyses for studying complex phenomena like pesticides impacts, the development within the academic science has proceeded in the opposite direction that might have accelerated marginalization of the third world subsistence agricultural communities. We hypothesize that, if these adversities are realized and accounted for, the benefits from the current use of pesticides could be outweighed by the costs of pollution and ill human health. This paper also illustrates different pathways and mechanisms for marginalization. In view of potential and overall negative impacts of pesticide use, we recommend alternative ways of controlling pests such as community integrated pest management (IPM) along with education and training activities. Such measures are likely to reduce the health and environmental costs of pesticide pollution, and also enhance the capabilities of third world agricultural communities in terms of knowledge, decision making, innovation, and policy change.

AB  - Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) are incentive-based instruments that provide conditional economic incentives for natural resources management. Research has shown that when economic incentives are parachuted into rural communities, participation and benefits are collectively negotiated and shared. However, we know little about how benefit-sharing evolves over time in community-based PES. To address this gap, we examine distributional justice in four communities of the state of Chiapas, Mexico, which participate in a PES programme, and we assess how local justice principles compare with the programme's goals. Our analysis reveals patterns of both continuity and change in how communities share PES benefits, which reflect a suite of contradictory justice principles, including entitlement, merit, need, and equality. The studied communities distribute PES benefits by providing differentiated compensation to diverse groups of landholders via private cash payments, whilst also attending non-landed community members through public infrastructure investments. We show that benefit-sharing is strongly influenced by pre-existing land tenure features and associated norms, which in the study area include three different types of individual and common-property. Yet, we also show that communities continuously adjust benefit-sharing arrangements to navigate distributional challenges emerging from programme engagement. Overall, we provide novel insights on the evolution, diversity, and complexity of distributive justice in community-based PES and we advocate for a context-sensitive, nuanced, and dynamic account of justice in incentive-based conservation.

AB  - Management practices such as relay cropping, cover crops, and no-tillage may promote soil health in the North Central United States. However, soil health indicators in corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] systems involving multiple management practices are not well documented. The objective of this study was to determine the sensitivity of soil health metrics and the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) to contrasting management systems with different tillage, crops, and fertilization in a North Central US Mollisol. Different management systems, including conservation tillage and nitrogen fertilization strategies, cover cropping, and camelina [Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz] relay intercropping, were compared to a conventional corn-soybean system. Different systems did not affect most soil health indicators compared to the conventional system. Aggregate stability was the only indicator to change due to management, where no-till with cover crops increased aggregate stability by 38% compared with camelina relay cropping. The SMAF scores for all the soil quality indices were unaffected by treatments but displayed high values of over 90%. Overall, crop yields were more closely related to weather conditions and management systems than to soil health indicators. Soybean yields were decreased (between 1 and 2 Mg ha-1) in the camelina relay cropping system, while corn yields were lower (up to 70%) in the treatment that received no N fertilization. Ultimately, these findings suggest that soil health indicators are resilient to change due to management in these highly productive Mollisols and may not be closely associated with crop yields. The sensitivity of soil health metrics and Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) to management systems was studied in North Central United States. Management systems did not affect most soil health indicators compared to the conventional corn-soybean rotation. No-tillage with cover crops increased aggregate stability by 38% compared with camelina relay crop. SMAF scores were similar for all treatments and indicated soils were functioning at over 90% of their potential. Crop yields were more closely related to weather conditions and management systems than to soil health.

AB  - This meta-analysis studied the impact of conventional versus organic farming practices on soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations and mass storage. We aimed to understand the carbon dynamics associated with adopting organic agricultural practices by reviewing and synthesizing data from 1950 to 2023. We analyzed data from 64 experimental field comparisons that involved SOC concentration and mass storage measurements, covering a wide range of studies selected for soil depth analyses, carbon concentration measurements, and comparative methods between conventional and organic systems. Our results indicated a significant increase in SOC under organic agriculture. An analysis of the response ratios (LnRR) for SOC concentration showed variability, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.089-0.149. Similarly, the analysis of carbon storage data indicated a 95% confidence interval of LnRR of 0.053-0.205. These increases in SOC concentration and mass storage reflect the variable but statistically positive impact of organic farming on SOC. Fine soil textures demonstrated the highest mean LnRR for both SOC concentration (0.163) and mass storage (0.173), suggesting the role of soil texture in mediating the effects of organic agriculture on SOC dynamics. Furthermore, there was a significant negative correlation between soil pH and SOC mass storage, with a regression coefficient of -0.174 (p < 0.039). Although a slight positive correlation was observed between temperature and SOC mass storage as LnRR, other environmental factors likely play a critical role in SOC dynamics. These findings emphasize the complexity of SOC dynamics and the significant impact of organic agriculture on increasing SOC concentrations and mass storage. This study broadly contributes to the debate in sustainable agriculture by providing quantitative evidence of the role and benefits of organic agriculture on climate change mitigation. The results also emphasize the importance of adopting organic farming practices for broadly enhancing ecosystems' resilience and long-term food security.

AB  - In Mauritania, most irrigated land was designed for, and remains devoted to, rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivation. Decades after introduction, however, yield remains below expectations, irrigated land is gradually being abandoned, and now crop diversification is promoted to improve sustainability of irrigated agriculture. This paper presents evidence of the potential, and limitations, of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) cropping in small-holder irrigation schemes along the Mauritanian side of the Senegal River Valley. Results are based on 3-years of on-farm participatory research (2007-2009) carried out at five irrigation schemes in collaboration with farmers and national research and extension services. Grain yield, water productivity and gross margin of sorghum and rice were compared at plot level. Global average grain yield over years and schemes was 2.5 t ha(-1) for sorghum, ranging from 1.7 t ha(-1) to 3.2 t ha(-1), compared to 5.6 t ha(-1) for rice, ranging from 4.0 t ha(-1) to 7.3 t ha(-1), even though both crops had similar total above-ground biomass at maturity. Sorghum required less irrigation water than rice (435 vs. 601 mm) but the smaller yield resulted in similar irrigation water productivity (0.87 vs. 0.96 kg m(-3)) and fuel (pumping) productivity (1.71 vs. 1.93 kg MJ(-1)). Despite smaller yields, however, sorghum profitability was significantly greater than rice (1172 vs. 788 epsilon ha(-1)), due to higher market price and, in the case of one scheme, lower irrigation costs. Main constraints identified in sorghum cropping were (i) poor crop establishment because of late sowing and water logging; (ii) neglected weed management; and (iii) mismatch between irrigation delivery schedules and water requirements. The causes of these constraints are particularities of rice production systems (design and heavy soil) and farmers' habits acquired with traditional rainfed sorghum cropping during the wet season. The analyses presented here reveal that sorghum cropping is a profitable option to rice for small-holder farmers, particularly on light-textured soils within the irrigation schemes. Furthermore, large variability of results among sorghum farmers and the high above-ground biomass at maturity suggests scope for improving grain yield and water productivity. Challenges remain, however, for adoption of sorghum in irrigated agriculture in Mauritania. National agricultural policies must ensure access to credit and agricultural inputs (seeds and fertilizers) and consider specific requirements for crop diversification (type of soil, irrigation distribution) in both rehabilitation of existing schemes and in design and construction of new ones.

AB  - This study has analysed the reductions in operational costs (pumping, water treatment and maintenance) and greenhouse gas emissions from regional water supplies that include installation of rainwater tanks used to supply domestic laundry, toilet and outdoor water uses across New South Wales. The household cost of rainwater supply ranged from $7.95/kL at Broken Hill to $ 0.88/kL in the Central Coast region. However, installation of rainwater tanks produced considerable reductions in operating costs of a city's water system ranging from $ 57 to $ 6371 per household installing a rainwater tank. Significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions of up to 75% from including rainwater tanks in regional water systems were also observed. In addition, significant improvement in the security of regional water supplies with subsequent deferral of the requirement for augmentation of supply (new dams or desalination plants) was observed for coastal cities. These benefits were seen to be dependent on the average annual rainfall depth, distance from the coast, and availability of reliable operational and augmentation data of a regional water system. This study reveals the importance of including rainwater tanks or, indeed, any other decentralised water management option in analysis of the operation of regional water systems to provide a realistic understanding of combinations of centralised and decentralised water management strategies.

AB  - This study analyzes consumer preferences toward Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) aspects of canned tuna fish in relation to environmental and social responsibility. The analysis investigates the different existing labeled standards on canned tuna fish, evaluating the effects of such CSR-labeled information on market price and consumer choice. Data collection was carried out at a retail store and respondents were interviewed only after they had put a tin of canned tuna fish, chosen from among those available in the real choice set, in their shopping basket. Data were analyzed using two different, but complementary, methods: hedonic pricing and random utility models. Results show that consumers are in search of environmental and social sustainability attributes for canned tuna fish. Indeed, especially concerning the environmental dimension, consumers prefer green products more than their ordinary counterparts. The findings indicate that products with environmental certifications are priced higher than regular non certified products, while those with social certifications are priced similarly to regular products. With regards to consumer choice, canned tuna with environmental or social certifications is preferred as opposed to the non-certified product, with both types of certifications showing a similar willingness to pay. The willingness to pay for such products seems to increase, ceteris paribus, with income and decrease with age. By combining the experimental findings of the two models adopted, managerial and policy implications are drawn. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Overly broad recalls following an FDA advisory occur when the source of an outbreak is originally misidentified or cannot be promptly identified. In this situation, an entire product category might be recalled (e.g., romaine lettuce), such that the recall extends to uncontaminated product lots, imposing spillover costs on entities that would otherwise be unaffected. There are, however, very few published studies that estimate the potential magnitude of these spillover costs. Using a formal structured elicitation methodology, this study develops expert estimates of the spillover costs firms typically incur in responding to an overly broad recall following an FDA product advisory. We find that the range of costs varies widely by type and size of firm, with producers incurring median costs per recall ranging from $3.0 million to $72.7 million per firm, shippers/distributors from $0.1 million to $2.3 million per firm, restaurants from $0.04 million to $1.1 million per firm, and nonrestaurant retailers from $0.1 million to $3.1 million per firm. The results of this study can help inform food policy discussions geared toward assessing the benefits of traceability in terms of avoided costs of overly broad food recalls. Industry is often reluctant to provide estimates on the costs of recalls. This study fills that void by estimating the per-firm costs incurred by food supply chain entities due to overly broad recalls.

AB  - Cover crops can increase soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage and reduce the potential for N leaching under agronomic crops, but little is known about their effect under bioenergy crops whose aboveground biomass is removed either for biofuel production or for livestock feed. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of cover crops on soil organic C (SOC), total N (STN), ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N), and nitrate-N (NO3-N) contents at the 0 to 30 cm (0 to 12 in) depth under bioenergy sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) crops from 2010 to 2013 in the southeastern United States. Treatments were two sorghum species (forage sorghum [Sorghum vulgare Pers.] and sweet sorghum) as the main plot and four cover crops as the split-plot treatments arranged in a randomized complete block with three replications. Cover crop treatments were legume (hairy vetch [Vicia villosa Roth]), nonlegume (rye [Secale cereal L.]), biculture of legume and nonlegume (hairy vetch/rye), and no cover crop (control). At 15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 in), SOC was greater with hairy vetch/rye than the control under forage sorghum. At 0 to 5 and 5 to 15 cm (0 to 2 and 2 to 6 in), STN was greater with hairy vetch and hairy vetch/rye than rye under forage sorghum and greater with hairy vetch/rye than the control under sweet sorghum. At 5 to 15 cm, NO3-N was greater with hairy vetch/rye than rye in 2011, but was greater with rye and hairy vetch than hairy vetch/rye in 2012. At all depths, NH4-N was greater under forage than sweet sorghum in 2012. Regardless of treatments, SOC and STN increased, but NH4-N and NO3-N varied from 2010 to 2013. Although soil available N varied with cover crops, sorghum types, and climatic conditions from year to year, hairy vetch/rye can conserve and/or increase soil C and N storage compared with vetch or rye alone, or the control under bioenergy sorghum in the southeastern United States. The results can be used to claim C credit, increase N cycling, and improve soil and environmental quality under bioenergy sorghum in the regions with similar soil and climatic conditions.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is not only a challenge for public health and hospitals, but affects many aspects of our societies. This Lilliput minireview deals with problems that the pandemic causes for the food industry, addressing the presence and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in the food environment, methods of virus inactivation and the protection of the food worker and the consumer. So far food has not been implicated in the transmission of the infection, but social disruptions caused by the pandemic could cause problems with food security.

AB  - This study assessed implications of the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic on household income and food security in two East African countries - Kenya and Uganda, using online survey data from 442 respondents. Results show that more than two-thirds of the respondents experienced income shocks due to the COVID-19 crisis. Food security and dietary quality worsened, as measured by the food insecurity experience scale and the frequency of consumption of nutritionally-rich foods. The proportion of food insecure respondents increased by 38% and 44% in Kenya and Uganda respectively, and in both countries, the regular consumption of fruits decreased by about 30% during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to a normal period (before the pandemic). Results from probit regressions show that the income-poor households and those dependent on labour income were more vulnerable to income shock, and had poorer food consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to other respondent cate-gories. As such, they were more likely to employ food-based coping strategies compared to those pursuing alternative livelihoods, who generally relied on savings. Farmers were less likely to experience worsened food security compared to other respondent categories who depended to a great extent on market sources for food. In both countries, participation in national social security schemes was less likely to mitigate respondents' income shock during the COVID-19 period. Conversely, membership savings and loan groups was correlated with less likelihood of suffering income shocks and reduction in food consumption. The results suggest that ongoing and future government responses should focus on structural changes in social security by developing responsive packages to cushion members pushed into poverty by such pandemics while building strong financial institutions to support the recovery of businesses in the medium term, and ensuring the resilience of food supply chains particularly those making available nutrient-dense foods.

AB  - Like the rest of the world, African countries are reeling from the health, economic and social effects of COVID-19. The continent's governments have responded by imposing rigorous lockdowns to limit the spread of the virus. The various lockdown measures are undermining food security, because stay at home orders have among others, threatened food production for a continent that relies heavily on agriculture as the bedrock of the economy. This article draws on quantitative data collected by the GeoPoll, and, from these data, assesses the effect of concern about the local spread and economic impact of COVID-19 on food worries. Qualitative data comprising 12 countries south of the Sahara reveal that lockdowns have created anxiety over food security as a health, economic and human rights/well-being issue. By applying a probit model, we find that concern about the local spread of COVID-19 and economic impact of the virus increases the probability of food worries. Governments have responded with various efforts to support the neediest. By evaluating the various policies rolled out we advocate for a feminist economics approach that necessitates greater use of data analytics to predict the likely impacts of intended regulatory relief responses during the recovery process and post-COVID-19.

AB  - Climate change will significantly impact the future viability and security of food production systems, with increased frequency and intensity of droughts, floods, storms and other extreme climatic events predicted in many regions. In order for food production systems to remain viable and resilient under a changing climate, novel approaches, which integrate risk management (i.e. adaptation) and risk transfer strategies, such as insurance, are required. We argue that the coordinated integration of risk management and risk transfer approaches will support greater resilience of food production systems under climate change. Conversely, if risk management and risk transfer strategies are not carefully integrated, there is potential to undermine adaptive capacity (e.g. insurance subsidies may dissuade farmers from investing in climate adaptation) and ultimately reduce the capacity of food production systems to cope with and recover from the adverse impacts of climate change. Here we propose a resilience-based conceptual framework for integrating risk management and risk transfer strategies along with four key principles, which we believe could underlie their successful integration and thus enhance food production system resilience under climate change. These are as follows: (1) pro-active investments in farmer climate adaptation rather than re-active disaster relief, (2) structuring of government subsidies around insurance and climate disaster relief to incentivise farmer climate adaptation, (3) rewarding farmer efforts towards climate adaptation with cheaper insurance premiums for those farmers that invest resources into climate adaptation and (4) recognising investments in the integration of farm climate adaptation and risk transfer schemes within the broader context of future climate disaster risk management and global food security. Such an integrated investment approach could substantially reduce future economic losses for farmers while also enhancing food security under climate change.

AB  - The twenty-first century represents the period of the most remarkable discoveries and transformations of the human civilization, but also the period of the most important changes regarding the evolution of the environment. At the present stage of the evolution of the society, the knowledge of the behaviour of the world economy cannot be conceived outside the environmental approach, as a system, structure and dynamics, its connections and implications on life on earth. Agriculture is an important source of emission of two greenhouse gases with a significant share in the influence of the global warming process. The key to protecting the environment from the harmful effects of widespread and unsafe farming practices is through implementing sustainable practices. Sustainable agriculture incorporates both the conservation of available resources and the use of agricultural practices aimed at protecting the environment. Given the increasing awareness of the environment and the specific knowledge of the various interdisciplinary technologies, special attention has been paid to unconventional technical applications, such as the use of textile structures in the agriculture and horticulture sectors to increase the quality and efficiency of agro-food products in terms of ensuring a healthy environment, social economic equity and a profitable economy. In this context, the textile sector and the field of technical textiles, through the potential of functionalities, can make a special contribution to achieving a level of coherence between agriculture, environment and rural development through the intelligent and sustainable capitalization of agricultural lands and labour force. For agro-textiles weight domain for the technical textile sector design is a problem-solving approach. based on common human technical/scientific skills or knowledge, which starts from understanding and observing the phenomena of the field in which these textile elements/products will be used. In this sense, the paper presents the logical matrix regarding the interactions between the problems that need to be solved, the elements that can influence the studied phenomenon the functions that the designed product has to fulfill and the effects produced by its use under real conditions of use.

AB  - Based on its production guideline, organic agriculture has set for itself the goals of minimizing all forms of pollution and maintaining sustainability of the farming system. By striving for these goals, organic farming meets the demands of an increasing number of consumers who are critical of conventional production methods. This paper gives an overview of the present state of the art in the different issues. Possibilities of and limitations in performing the self-aimed goals under the basic standards of organic agriculture are discussed. Concerning environmental protection, in general, the risk of adverse environmental effects is lower with organic than with conventional farming methods, though not necessarily so; with reference to soil fertility and nutrient management, organic farming is suited to improve soil fertility and nutrient management markedly on the farm level; regarding biodiversity, comparison studies show that organic farming has more positive effects on biodiversity conservation; in relation to product quality, under the basic standards of organic farming, there is no sufficient evidence for a system-related effect on product quality due to the production method.

AB  - The expansion of agriculture and intensive mechanized production have resulted in the loss of habitats and biodiversity, which has led to the loss of ecological services such as the biological control of pests and diseases, and insect-borne pollination. Current studies mainly focus on the impact of small-scale crop diversity (such as intercropping) on ecological service but lack research on the effects of crop diversity at the landscape scale. In this study, vegetation-dwelling arthropods in naked oat (Avena chinensis) fields under different planting patterns were collected at different growth stages by standardized sweep netting sampling, and the differences in arthropod communities and temporal dynamics were analyzed. Taking this information as an example, the effects of crop diversity at the landscape scale caused by different planting patterns on arthropod communities were studied. It was found that herbivores were the most abundant functional group in the arthropod community in naked oat fields, accounting for 70.13% of the total abundance, followed by natural enemies, accounting for 23.45%, and, finally, other insects. The abundance and species richness of natural enemies in naked oat fields under diversified planting pattern were significantly higher than those under intensive planting pattern, while the abundance and species richness of herbivorous pests showed no significant difference between the two planting patterns. Planting patterns significantly affected the composition and structure of arthropod communities in naked oat fields. Significantly higher ratio of natural enemy to pest and more diverse natural enemies under the diversified planting pattern have shown better biological control potential and the significance of biodiversity protection.

AB  - The increasing use of antibiotics in animal production has become an emergent environmental problem. The large percentages of applied antibiotic doses eliminated in animal excrement often end up contaminating water resources, which are then used for irrigation ? compromising agricultural production and/or food security. Here, we evaluated the effects of crop irrigation with water artificially contaminated by enrofloxacin (10 ?g l- 1) and its accumulation in soybean, bean, and corn tissues. Grain production was evaluated on the basis of grain dry weight plant-1, while enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin (its breakdown metabolite) concentrations in plant tissues were evaluated by HPLC after harvesting. Diminished production was observed only in soybean plants irrigated with antibiotic-contaminated water. Enrofloxacin [1.68 ng g fresh weight (FW)-1 to 26.17 ?g g FW-1] and ciprofloxacin (8.23 ng g FW-1 to 51.05 ng g FW-1), were found in all of the plant tissues (roots, leaves, and seeds) of the three species. Regardless of the species, the highest enrofloxacin concentrations were observed in their roots, followed by the leaves and seeds, while ciprofloxacin concentrations varied among the different plant tissues of the different species. The presence of enrofloxacin in the water used for irrigating soybeans can result in productivity losses and, as that antibiotic was encountered in plant tissues (leaves and seeds) of all of the three species analyzed that are consumed in the diets of both humans and animals, it can interfere with food security.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) fertilization and straw incorporation strongly influence nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural fields. An in-situ micro-plot experiment on intensively farmed winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was conducted to investigate the source and rate of N2O emissions from soils following labeled N-15 fertilization with and without straw incorporation. Four treatments, i.e., no N fertilizer and no straw incorporation (N0S0), straw incorporation only (N0S1), N fertilizer only (N1S0), and N fertilization plus straw incorporation (N1S1), were established in the experiment. The N2O emissions mainly occurred after N fertilization and lasted for approximately 1-2 weeks, accounting for 60%-67% of the wheat seasonal N2O emissions. Within the 6 days after basal fertilization and 2-4 days after top-dressing, most of the N2O fluxes (> 50%) were derived from fertilizer. Thereafter, soil-derived N2O dominated the total N2O emissions and within 10-20 days after N fertilization, fertilizer-derived N2O became negligible. Fertilizer N and soil N both accounted for 40%-60% of the seasonal N2O emissions, which may be explained by the high soil N stock due to long-term high N fertilization in the region. This implies the similar roles of soil N pool and fertilizer N in N2O generation under intensively farmed soils. The N fertilization had a significant priming effect on the turnover of soil N, which contributed 21.02%-50.47% of the total N2O emissions. During the basal fertilization/first irrigation event, straw incorporation significantly (P < 0.05) stimulated CO2 fluxes both in N-fertilized and non-N-fertilized plots; however, after the top-dressing/second irrigation event, the significant increase of CO2 fluxes induced by straw incorporation was only observed in the N-fertilized treatment. Straw incorporation interacted with N fertilization, and tended to enhance N2O emissions in the basal fertilization and lower N2O emissions in the top-dressing period. In N-fertilized plots, the seasonal N2O emissions from straw-incorporated and straw-removed treatments were similar, indicating that straw incorporation enhanced the N supply without increasing the N2O emissions. Our study highlights that there are significant benefits of straw incorporation to soil fertility improvement; however, the long-term impacts of straw incorporation on greenhouse gas emissions should be further examined.

AB  - The decrease in grain plantation areas poses a growing concern for global food security. China, with its large population, increasingly diversified food demands, and relatively small cultivated lands, has suffered deeply from this phenomenon (non-grain production, NGP) in recent years. Since 2020, the central government of China has claimed to deal with this problem by attracting agriculturalists and organizations involved in grain plantation. In this context, understanding the global NGP of the national situation is vital for policy making. Remote sensing is regarded as the most effective and accurate method for this purpose, but existing studies have mainly focused on algorithms operating at the local scale or exploring grain-producing capability from the perspective of agricultural space. As such, the characterization of NGP on a national scale remains deficient. In this study, we tried to bridge the gap through spatio-analysis with a newly published nationwide crop pattern and land use geo-datasets; the quantitative, spatial, and structural features, as well as the utilization of NGP cropland in the year 2019, were observed. The results showed that about 60% of the cropland was used for non-grain plantation. About 15% of the NGP parcels were cultivated with grains at least three times in the past 4 years, and of these 60% and 40% were parcels with double- or single-season plantation, respectively, which could result in a 16-22% increase in the grain-sown area compared with 2019. Forest and grassland were the dominant non-cropping categories which NGP cropland transferred into, indicating more time and economic cost for regaining grains. NGP parcels also presented spatio-heterogeneity regarding cropping intensity and transformation. Parcels with double-season plantation mostly emerged in northern, central, and southern provinces, while those with single-season plantation were always located in northeastern and western provinces. The parcels that were transferred into forest or grassland mainly appeared in southern and Inner Mongolia, respectively, while the parcels in northern and central areas mostly continued cropping. According to these results, we propose remediation policies focusing on raising the cropping intensity of cultivated land in central and northern provinces due to their advantages of water, heat, terrain, and land use change features. Future work is warranted based on this study's deficiencies and uncertainties. As a forerunner, this study provides a holistic observation of the NGP phenomenon in mainland China on a national scale, and the findings can inform improvements in land use policies concerning grain production and food security in China.

AB  - Research on biodiversity management in production systems involves various aspects, including selecting optimal population arrangements for cultivated plants. The utilization of unconventional vegetables, such as taioba (Xanthosoma sagittifolium (L.) Schott), in the diversification of production systems offers a promising alternative to enhance food security and income generation for producers. However, limited information exists in the literature regarding its management and production. Thus, the present study aimed to assess different planting densities of taioba cultivated in intercropping under banana orchards by evaluating its development and yield. The experiment was conducted at the Federal University of Espirito Santo (UFES), located in Alegre, ES, Brazil. The experimental design employed randomized blocks with six replications, following a split-plot arrangement. The plots consisted of single and double rows of planting systems, while the subplots were comprised of between-plant spacings of 30, 40, and 50 cm. Various parameters were evaluated, namely, leaf area, number of leaves, leaf fresh and dry matter, chlorophyll indices, flavonoids, and nitrogen balance. Additionally, gross income was determined by estimating the production capacity of leaves and converting it into the production capacity of commercial leaf bundles, considering a 1.0 ha taioba cultivation area based on the intercropping arrangements with banana trees. The highest fresh and dry matter yields of taioba were achieved with the largest spacing between plants (50 cm) in both single and double rows. The number of leaves produced by the plants remained unaffected by the studied arrangements. Consequently, the highest gross yield was obtained with the highest plant density, achieved through a planting spacing of 30 cm between plants in double rows. These findings underscore the viability of diversifying production within banana orchards by incorporating taioba planting in alternating rows, providing a genuine opportunity for additional income for farmers.

AB  - Soil health is crucial for global food production in the context of an ever-growing global population. Microbiomes, a combination of microorganisms and their activities, play a pivotal role by biodegrading contaminants, maintaining soil structure, controlling nutrients' cycles, and regulating the plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Microbiome-based solutions along the soil-plant continuum, and their scaling up from laboratory experiments to field applications, hold promise for enhancing agricultural sustainability by harnessing the power of microbial consortia. Synthetic microbial communities, i.e., selected microbial consortia, are designed to perform specific functions. In contrast, natural communities leverage indigenous microbial populations that are adapted to local soil conditions, promoting ecosystem resilience, and reducing reliance on external inputs. The identification of microbial indicators requires a holistic approach. It is fundamental for current understanding the soil health status and for providing a comprehensive assessment of sustainable land management practices and conservation efforts. Recent advancements in molecular technologies, such as high-throughput sequencing, revealed the incredible diversity of soil microbiomes. On one hand, metagenomic sequencing allows the characterization of the entire genetic composition of soil microbiomes, and the examination of their functional potential and ecological roles; on the other hand, culturomics-based approaches and metabolic fingerprinting offer complementary information by providing snapshots of microbial diversity and metabolic activities both in and ex-situ. Long-term storage and cryopreservation of mixed culture and whole microbiome are crucial to maintain the originality of the sample in microbiome biobanking and for the development and application of microbiome-based innovation. This review aims to elucidate the available approaches to characterize diversity, function, and resilience of soil microbial communities and to develop microbiome-based solutions that can pave the way for harnessing nature's untapped resources to cultivate crops in healthy soils, to enhance plant resilience to abiotic and biotic stresses, and to shape thriving ecosystems unlocking the potential of soil microbiomes is key to sustainable agriculture. Improving management practices by incorporating beneficial microbial consortia, and promoting resilience to climate change by facilitating adaptive strategies with respect to environmental conditions are the global challenges of the future to address the issues of climate change, land degradation and food security.

AB  - Although the important public health issues of food insecurity and suicide may be interconnected, they are rarely studied. Using data from a national survey, we examined whether household food insecurity was associated with suicidal ideation after adjusting for relevant covariates. We examined cross-sectional data from three Canadian provinces (n = 5,270) that were derived from the 2007 Canadian Community Health Survey and included adults (18+ years). Suicidal ideation was based on affirmative response to the question of whether or not the participant had seriously considered committing suicide in the previous 12 months. The Household Food Security Survey Module provided measures of moderate (indication of compromise in quality and/or quantity of food consumed) and severe (indication of reduced food intake and disrupted eating patterns) food insecurity status. Logistic regression determined associations between food insecurity and suicidal ideation with adjustment for demographics, body mass index, and presence of a mood disorder. There were differences in the proportion experiencing suicide ideation according to moderate (14.7 vs 10.0 % without suicide ideation) and severe (16.4 vs 7.1 % without suicide ideation) food security (p < 0.001). With covariate adjustment, suicidal ideation was significantly associated with moderate (adjusted OR = 1.32, 95 % CI 1.06-1.64) and severe (adjusted OR = 1.77, 95 % CI 1.42-2.23) food insecurity. The findings of a robust association between food insecurity and suicidal ideation suggest that interventions targeted at food security may reduce suicide-related morbidity and mortality. Longitudinal investigations that examine various dimensions of food insecurity will advance understanding of etiological pathways involved in food insecurity and suicide.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the acceptability of an identified staple product enriched with amaranth grain, a traditionally used wild plant familiar to most of the population, after households' food security status revealed that the majority of them were either at risk or food insecure. Design/methodology/approach - A two-phase non-experimental, quantitative survey design with purposive sampling was used to explore the variety of foods consumed and the food security status of lower skilled (n = 63) and higher skilled (n = 81) income-earning households. During the second phase, recipe development and sensory acceptance of bread enriched with grain amaranth (n = 91) were determined. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse the data. Findings - Food insecurity was evident among the majority of the lower skilled income households while nearly one in four households in both groups were at risk to become insecure. Daily consumption of chicken and maize meal was evident in lower income households while the frequency in higher income households were significantly less. Bread was found to be the most consumed food product among all households (p = 0.001; r = 0.455). Supplementation of wheat flour with amaranth flour, a nutritious traditionally familiar wild plant, to support households' food consumption was investigated. Results from sensory evaluation panels revealed that both bread samples with different percentage of amaranth flour (15 and 25 per cent) were acceptable. Originality/value - The most important contribution of this study is the re-introduction and incorporation of a traditional food, amaranth, into a modern frequently consumed food to support households' nutritional and monetary demands to ultimately contribute to general well-being and household food security.

AB  - Enhancing global soil organic carbon storage by 4 per mille (parts per thousand) per annum would be enough to halt current net greenhouse gas emissions, but this goal seems lofty for conventional agriculture, which frequently results in soil organic carbon and nitrogen losses. Replacing mineral nitrogen with organic nitrogen sources may benefit soil carbon and nitrogen cycling in agricultural soils, but long-term effects are yet to be clearly demonstrated, especially in soils of high natural fertility. Here we report the effects of 34 years of legumes (crimson clover, fava beans) and non-legumes (maize) in rotation combined with different fertilization regimes (no fertilization, PK fertilization, NPK fertilization) on soil carbon and nitrogen storage throughout the uppermost meter of the soil profile. Fava beans did not enhance profile carbon storage. However, fava beans induced positive effects on subsoil nitrogen cycling, with lower subsoil nitrogen densities indicating lower nitrogen leaching potential. Incorporating a clover green mulch every 4 years enhanced organic carbon storage by an average of 4.1 parts per thousand per annum down the full meter of soil compared with a conventional maize rotation, but only combined with phosphorus and potassium fertilization. The enhancement was detected below the plough-horizon, indicating that merely sampling topsoil is insufficient to assess soil carbon dynamics in these arable soils. In contrast, maize contributed only a small portion to SOC, with subsoil C contributions negligible. These results indicate that a careful combination of long-term, site-adapted crop and fertilization management strategies can help enhance SOC storage in naturally fertile soils without apparent C deficit.

AB  - The diversity of Holdridge Life Zone types in the Brazilian Amazon region is studied to gain perspective on the consequences of deforestation. The study is based on a life zone map of Brazil by J.A. Tosi, Jr. at a scale of 1:10,000,000. The Amazon area of the map was digitized with a cell size of 50 km by 50 km. The resulting data base consists of 1789 cells from 17 life zones. Tropical moist forest covers 60% of the area followed by tropical premontane wet forest transition and tropical premontane moist forest transition at about 10% each. Each of the remaining 14 life zone types covers 3% or less of the total area. Loss of forest area in life zone types due to deforestation is simulated by removing cells from the data base. Differential spatial patterns of deforestation are tested to assess their impact on life zone diversity. Deforestation along the Trans-Amazon Highway generated the least impact while deforestation along a frontier advancing from the south generated the most impact, in terms of loss of life zone diversity. These results show that the relative loss rate of life zone forest types is dependent on where deforestation begins.

AB  - Deforestation and forest fires in the Brazilian Amazon are a regional-scale anthropogenic process related to biomass burning, which has a direct impact on global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions. Containment of this process requires characterizing its spatial distribution and that of the environmental factors related to its occurrence. The aim of this study is to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of deforested areas and forest fires in the State of Roraima from 2000 to 2010. We mapped deforested areas and forest fires using Landsat images and associated their occurrence with two phytoclimatic zones: zone with savanna influence (ZIS), and zone without savanna influence (ZOS). Total deforested area during the interval was estimated at 3.06 x 10(3) km(2) (ZIS = 55 %; ZOS = 45 %) while total area affected by forest fires was estimated at 3.02 x 10(3) km(2) (ZIS = 97.7 %; ZOS = 2.3 %). Magnitude of deforestation in Roraima was not related to the phytoclimatic zones, but small deforested areas (a parts per thousand currency sign17.9 ha) predominated in ZOS while larger deforestation classes (> 17.9 ha) predominated in ZIS, which is an area with a longer history of human activities. The largest occurrence of forest fires was observed in the ZIS in years with El Nio events. Our analysis indicates that the areas most affected by forest fires in Roraima during 2000-2010 were associated with strong climatic events and the occurrence these fires was amplified in ZIS, a sensitive phytoclimatic zone with a higher risk of anthropogenic fires given its drier climate and open forest structure.

AB  - In the past two decades, the South part of Serbia has been affected by exploitive and illegal logging. As this trend is not decreasing to this day, there is a need to determine the area where this logging occurred precisely. The consequences of these actions are tremendous, causing the forest owners' financial loss (regardless of whether it is private or state property) and a negative impact on the environment. Significant environmental and forest management problems deriving from these actions are erosion increase and more frequent torrential floods occurrence in the catchment. Since it is difficult to update the national forest inventories in remote areas, remote sensing techniques using different satellite imagery types can provide up-to-date data. The initial analysis that employed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (created using Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 imagery) indicates massive deforestation in the research area between 1999 and 2021. Headwaters of the Stavska river catchment is selected as the research area to determine the amount of erosion in two periods-before and after deforestation occurred. Change in land cover (LC) is presented with two LC maps created applying supervised classification to Landsat 7 imagery from 1999 as a pre-deforestation LC state and Landsat 8 imagery acquired in 2021 as the current LC state. The erosion in the catchment for both periods is determined using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The analysis results show the erosion change incurred as a deforestation effect in the river catchment. With the data obtained by remote sensing and SWAT analysis, it is possible to track changes in the area and acquire essential data, making the right and fast decisions to protect the natural resources economy and make sustainable development possible in this impoverished region.

AB  - The concentration and biomarker compositions of sedimentary organic matter (OM) as well as fine and coarse suspended particles were analysed to identify the impact of deforestation on the transport of terrigenous organic matter (OM) in the Rio Tapajos, a major tributary to the Amazon. Substantial shifts in the concentration and composition of recently deposited sedimentary OM suggest that intensive deforestation over the last few decades has considerably modified the natural inputs of sedimentary materials to the aquatic ecosystems by disrupting the terrigenous fluxes of humus and soil materials from the drainage basin. The observed compositional changes of bulk OM and land derived biomarkers (e.g. lignin) in recent sediments illustrate a sedimentary enrichment in OM from soil horizons that, under normal forest cover, tend to be retained in the drainage basin. On average, the recently accumulated OM is nitrogen-rich ((C/N)a = 12-15) and more highly degraded ((Ac/Al)v = 0.4-0.6 and DHBA/V = 0.15-0.20) than deep materials ((C/N)a = 20-30, (Ac/Al)v = 0.25-0.4, and DHBA/V = 0.05-0.10), showing that this recently accumulated material is more humified than original inputs to the aquatic system, and consistent with increased exportation of fine eroded mineral and organic particles from surface soils along river banks. The present study illustrates the relevance of using OM oxidation products in sediment profiles to evaluate deforestation impacts on aquatic ecosystems and to characterize the nature of eroded soil materials, complementing studies on mineral/metal cycling.

AB  - The rising concern about agro-environmental problems has made the selection of green crops a critical task for agriculture sector. The choosing of alternative eco-friendly crops is a main task in developing countries, especially in Iran. As a complete framework, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) evaluates agricultural activities on the environment. However, this framework, by itself, is not able to directly assess water use impacts. Accordingly, it is necessary to integrate certain methods capable of being developed to evaluate water effects into this framework so as to achieve a more comprehensive assessment. Water footprint (WF) is one of the best indicators developed with the aim of evaluating the virtual water contents of corps. Practitioners can take the benefit of LCA + WF in association with management methods and optimization techniques, including Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) to obtain better results in their studies and provide their target populations with more practical solutions. In the current study, we recommend a general way to compare the agro-environmental efficiency of oil seed crops. The goal of this research was to evaluate the environmental effects and WF of the production of soybean (Glycine max), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), and canola (Brassica napus) oilseed crops in Ardabil-Iran. The environmental impacts categories are eutrophication, acidification, global warming potential, and photochemical oxidation. The total amount of WF of soybean, sunflower and canola in Ardabil Province are 839.57, 1209.04 and 2329.64 m(3)/tonne, respectively. It was found that the environmental effects from the three crops comes generally from manufactured fertilizer, manure, diesel combustion, agricultural practices, and electricity for irrigation. The results showed that sunflower demonstrated a higher environmental load because of its lower seed yield and higher WF and energy demands. It can be concluded that soybean is most appropriate for cultivation in Ardabil situations. Results indicated that integrates WF and LCA methods to compare the agro-environmental efficiency of oil seed crops could be applied as the starting point for assessment of crop production systems aimed at cost management, WF and environmental burdens reduction, and optimization in the oilseed crop production sector. The assessment framework would be adaptable and applicable to any other agricultural systems, including different crop rotation and production systems. It can be finally improved to overshadow the entire agriculture sector. The proposed systemic approach can be also modified according to any research goals and scopes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Sustainable management of the natural environment is essential. Continued environmental degradation will lead to worsened health outcomes in countries and across generations. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a framework for viewing the preservation of natural environments and the promotion of health, wellbeing and health equity as interconnected pursuits. Within the SDG framework the goals of promoting environmental sustainability and human health are unified through attention to the social determinants of health and health equity (SDH/HE). This paper presents findings from a document analysis of all Australian environment sector policies and selected legislation to examine whether and how current approaches support progress toward achieving SDG goals on water, climate change, and marine ecosystems (Goals 6, 13 and 14), and to consider implications for health and health equity. Results: Consideration of a broad range of SDH/HE was evident in the analysed documents. Related collaborations between environment and health sectors were identified, but the bulk of proposed actions on SDH/HE were initiated by the environment sector as part of its core business. Strengths of Australian policy in regard to SDGs 6, 13 and 14 are reflected in recognition of the effects of climate change, a strong cohesive approach to marine park protection, and recognition of the need to protect existing water and sanitation systems from future threats. However, climate change strategies focus predominately on resilience, adaptation and heat related health effects, rather than on more comprehensive mitigation policies. The findings emphasise the importance of strengthened cross-sectoral action to address both the drivers and effects of environmental degradation. A lack of policy coherence between jurisdictions was also evident in several areas, compounded by inadequate national guidance, where vague strategies and nonspecific devolution of responsibilities are likely to compromise coordination and accountability. Conclusions: Evidence on planetary health recognises the interconnectedness of environmental and human health and, as such, suggests that ineffective management of climate change and water pose serious risks to both the natural environment and human well-being. To address these risks more effectively, and to achieve the SDGs, our findings indicate that cross-jurisdiction policy coherence and national coordination must be improved. In addition, more action to address global inequities is required, along with more comprehensive approaches to climate change mitigation.

AB  - Rural communities rely on smallholder maize farms for subsistence agriculture, the main driver of local economic activity and food security. However, their planted area estimates are unknown in most developing countries. This study explores the use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data to map smallholder maize farms. The random forest (RF), support vector (SVM) machine learning algorithms and model stacking (ST) were applied. Results show that the classification of combined Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data improved the RF, SVM and ST algorithms by 24.2%, 8.7%, and 9.1%, respectively, compared to the classification of Sentinel-1 data individually. Similarities in the estimated areas (7001.35 +/- 1.2 ha for RF, 7926.03 +/- 0.7 ha for SVM and 7099.59 +/- 0.8 ha for ST) show that machine learning can estimate smallholder maize areas with high accuracies. The study concludes that the single-date Sentinel-1 data were insufficient to map smallholder maize farms. However, single-date Sentinel-1 combined with Sentinel-2 data were sufficient in mapping smallholder farms. These results can be used to support the generation and validation of national crop statistics, thus contributing to food security.

AB  - Simple Summary Designing early warning systems for threats to food crops in Africa must respond to the needs of potential users of the system. This paper provides evidence from professional distributors, retailers, researchers, and agronomists in East Africa who may be able to use and communicate the results of the predictive modeling of pest outbreaks. Understanding the timing and spatial extent of required warnings will help guide research and engagement in these rapidly commercializing countries. Early warnings of the risks of pest and disease outbreaks are becoming more urgent, with substantial increases in threats to agriculture from invasive pests. With geospatial data improvements in quality and timeliness, models and analytical systems can be used to estimate potential areas at high risk of yield impacts. The development of decision support systems requires an understanding of what information is needed, when it is needed, and at what resolution and accuracy. Here, we report on a professional review conducted with 53 professional agronomists, retailers, distributors, and growers in East Africa working with the Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture. The results showed that respondents reported fall armyworm, stemborers and aphids as being among the most common pests, and that crop diversification was a key strategy to reduce their impact. Chemical and cultural controls were the most common strategies for fall armyworm (FAW) control, and biological control was the least known and least used method. Of the cultural control methods, monitoring and scouting, early planting, and crop rotation with non-host crops were most used. Although pests reduced production, only 55% of respondents were familiar with early warning tools, showing the need for predictive systems that can improve farmer response.

AB  - Most countries have committed to protect 17% of their terrestrial area by 2020 through Aichi Target 11 of the Convention on Biological Diversity, with a focus on protecting areas of particular importance for biodiversity. This means national-scale spatial conservation prioritisations are needed to help meet this target and guide broader conservation and land-use policy development. However, to ensure these assessments are adopted by policy makers, they mist also consider national priorities. This situation is exemplified by Guyana, a corner of Amazonia that couples high biodiversity with low economic development. In recent years activities that threaten biodiversity conservation have increased, and consequently, protected areas are evermore critical to achieving the Aichi targets. Here we undertake a cost-effective approach to protected area planning in Guyana that accounts for in-country conditions. To do this we conducted a stakeholder-led spatial conservation prioritisation based on meeting targets for 17 vegetation types and 329 vertebrate species, while minimising opportunity costs for forestry, mining, agriculture and urbanisation. Our analysis identifies 3 million ha of priority areas for conservation, helping inform government plans to double the current protected area network from 8.5 to 17%. As part of this, we also develop a new technique to prioritise engagement with local communities whose lands are identified as important to conservation. Our study both provides a scientifically robust, politically acceptable protected area expansion strategy for Guyana, and illustrates the importance of conservation planning at the country-scale to translate international commitments into national action.

AB  - Tropical deforestation is occuring at in alarming rate, threatening the ecological integrity of protected areas. This makes it vital to regularly assess protected areas to confirm the efficacy of measures that protect that area from clearing. Satellite remote sensing offers a systematic and objective means for detecting bind monitoring deforestation. This paper examines a spectral change approach to detect deforestation using pattern decomposition (PD) coefficients from multitemporal Landsat data. Our results show that the PD coefficients for soil and vegetation can be used to detect deforestation using change vector analysis (CVA). CVA analysis demonstrates that deforestation in the Kinabalu area, Sabah, Malaysia has significantly slowed from 1.22% in period 1 (1973 and 1991) to 0.1% in period 2 (1991 and 1996). A comparison of deforestation both inside and outside Kinabalu Park has highlighted the effectiveness of the park in protecting the tropical forest against clearing. However, the park is still facing pressure from the area immediately surrounding the park (the 1 km buffer zone) where the deforestation rate has remained unchanged. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - BackgroundClimate change is one of humanity's biggest problems. CSA offers a once-in-a-lifetime chance to adapt to global climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. UA can improve food security by providing affordable, nutritious alternatives to commercially produced food, especially for economically disadvantaged people. This study examined the factors influencing the adoption of UA as CSA practices, as well as their effects on food security in Wolaita Sodo City, South Ethiopia.MethodsData was collected from primary and secondary sources, both qualitative and quantitative form. A structured and semi-structured questionnaire was used to gather data from 384 randomly chosen urban households through surveys/interviews, focus group conversations, and observation. The percentage and mean differences between UA adopters and non-adopters were calculated using the chi-square test and t-test. A propensity score matching (PSM) model assessed UA's impact on food security. A binary logistic regression model was used to determine factors influencing adoption of UA as CSA practice in the study area.ResultsThe descriptive analysis showed that 53.53% of respondents used UA. Statistics showed the existence of a significant mean differences between adopters and non-adopters in employment level, UA attitudes, and household size. Logit model computations showed that family size, home ownership, the household head's occupation, perceptions of UA, market demand, and access to training and support influenced UA adoption as a climate-smart farming practice.ConclusionsAs per the study's findings, there could be a correlation between specific factors and the adoption of UA as CSA in the studied area. The PSM study confirmed that UA deployment significantly improves food security. UA adoption increased food security by 0.685-fold. The report recommends that municipal education offices, UA offices, and cooperative offices create an integrated functional adult education programme for urbanites. Since UA is vital to fighting food insecurity, it suggests increasing support for cooperative entities.

AB  - Declining agricultural production in many developing countries has prompted increased use of some inputs while continuous cropping prevails. This study analysed the factors promoting different forms of agricultural intensification in southwestern Nigeria. Data collected from randomly selected farmers in selected states in southwestern Nigeria were used. Results show that farmers from Osun State have the highest indices of intensification with respect to land use intensity, fertilizer use intensity and crop diversification. The censored regression showed that lost working days, use of fertilizers, crop rotation, and having more inherited land increased land use intensity while use of organic manure, minimum tillage and poverty reduced crop diversification index. Fertilizer use intensity increased with the use of minimum tillage and household size while hired and family labour use intensity increased with household size. It was recommended that in the face of increasing land degradation, farmers' access to fertilizer must be increased and efforts to reduce their poverty level must be promoted, among others. [A. S.

AB  - Soil carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C:N) represents an indicator of soil quality and fertility, having a major impact on agricultural land management for organic farming. Determination of soil C:N suitability zones is a necessary procedure in the process, enabling effective land management. A total of 72 soil samples at two soil layers at 0-10 cm and 20-30 cm were used in the study, evenly distributed in the Osijek-Baranja County in eastern Croatia. Ordinary kriging (OK) and Lognormal kriging (LK) using linear, Gaussian and spherical mathematical models, alongside Inverse distance weighted (IDW) were evaluated for the spatial prediction of soil C:N. Inner accuracy representing retention of input sample values in the interpolation results and outer accuracy representing a prediction accuracy at unknown locations were used to determine optimal interpolation parameters. K-means unsupervised classification algorithm was used for the objective determination of soil C:N suitability zones in five classes specified by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). IDW resulted in the highest inner accuracy, while OK with the Gaussian model produced the highest outer accuracy with the average R-2 = 0.7908 and NRMSE = 0.0544. Contrary to the previous research, higher mean soil C:N results in a lower soil layer of 20-30 cm with 13.41, compared to 12.03 at 0-10 cm soil layer. The highest soil C:N suitability was determined in only 4.8% of the study area, with the suitability index of 18.44. Meanwhile, the two largest classes were marginally suitable and currently unsuitable class, covering 35.5% and 27.7% of the study area, respectively. These results indicated a necessity for the adjustment of agricultural land management practices to enable sustainable organic farming.

AB  - With global trade development, emerging economies can absorb biomass energy production techniques and technologies from developed countries. However, several constraints still need to be improved in producing biomass energy in emerging economies. Therefore, this research aims to understand the critical motivating factors of biomass energy production that contribute to a circular economy via agricultural by-products in Vietnam 's emerging economy. This study employs a qualitative analysis using information from the in-depth interviews of farmer households, agricultural by-product traders, and bioenergy producers in Vietnam. This study revealed the motivating factors as the main determinants in producing biomass energy: (1) digitalization, (2) technical and logistics, (3) social capital, (4) prices, and (5) government supports. This study also confirms that Vietnam has diverse biomass waste sources and a high potential for biomass energy production. To motivate biomass energy development, the government should support credit and loans for stakeholders in producing biomass energy. Moreover, the government should encourage and support energy producers to implement digital transformation to expand production scale and improve business operations. Insights from this study can help farmers, traders, and bioenergy producers by adapting their strategies within their local contexts.

AB  - Proso millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) is a rich source of protein, minerals, and vitamins, and is an important cereal crop of Asia and Africa. Due to its lowest water and nutrient requirement, it has the potential for agriculture diversification. The development of a core collection would assist in efficient management and enhanced utilisation of proso millet genetic resources. The present investigation was conducted to develop a core collection of proso millet based on geographic information and 20 qualitative and quantitative traits recorded on 833 accessions conserved in the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics genebank. The entire germplasm collection was stratified into five groups based on races and data on 20 morpho-agronomic traits were used for clustering following Ward's method. About 10% (or at least one accession) was randomly selected from each of 101 clusters to constitute a core collection of 106 accessions. Comparisons of means, variances, frequency distribution, diversity indices, and correlation studies indicated that the variation in the entire collection has been preserved in the core collection. This core collection provides a gateway to identify diverse trait-specific germplasm accessions for important agronomic traits and for abiotic and biotic stresses for use in crop improvement research and in crop diversification programs.

AB  - The application of chemical fertilizers to enhance crop production is a major concern due to associated environmental pollution and health hazards. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop an eco-friendly solution to improve crop production and promote sustainable agriculture simultaneously. Stevia rebaudiana is an important medicinal crop being substitute for sugar, superior flavor outline, extensive medicinal properties, and also of agronomic interest. In the present study, bacterium STJP isolated from the rhizospheric soil of S. rebaudiana and identified as Bacillus safensis on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing, showed good amount of zinc (4.4 mg/L) and potassium (5.4 mg/L) solubilization. Paneer-whey (a dairy waste) based bioformulation (P-WBF) was developed utilizing isolate B. safensis STJP (accession number NAIMCC TB-2833) and inspected for the quality and ability to enhance the growth, nutrients uptake, and stevioside content in S. rebaudiana. The application of P-WBF displayed a significantly higher concentration (153.12%) of stevioside in S. rebaudiana as compared to control. P-WBF treated Stevia plants showed significantly higher fresh and dry weight as well (as compared to control). Further, enhancement of phosphorous, nitrogen, potassium, and zinc uptake in plant tissue was also recorded by application of P-WBF. This study suggests the use of P-WBF based biofertilizer using B. safensis STJP to increase stevioside content in Stevia plant by a nutrient(s) linked mechanism. This novel approach can also be beneficial for utilization of a dairy waste in preparation of bioformulation and, for enhancement of crop yield by an ecofriendly manner leading to sustainable agriculture.

AB  - Bioelectrochemical systems (BES) are a newly emerged technology for energy-efficient water and wastewater treatment. Much effort as well as significant progress has been made in advancing this technology towards practical applications treating various types of waste. However, BES application for agriculture has not been well explored. Herein, studies of BES related to agriculture are reviewed and the potential applications of BES for promoting sustainable agriculture are discussed. BES may be applied to treat the waste/wastewater from agricultural production, minimizing contaminants, producing bioenergy, and recovering useful nutrients. BES can also be used to supply irrigation water via desalinating brackish water or producing reclaimed water from wastewater. The energy generated in BES can be used as a power source for wireless sensors monitoring the key parameters for agricultural activities. The importance of BES to sustainable agriculture should be recognized, and future development of this technology should identify proper application niches with technological advancement.

AB  - The organic boom in agriculture at the turn of the new millennium culminated in ambitious political goals for further growth in organic agricultural production and consumption. In Norway, the present goal is to reach a level of 15% organic production and consumption by 2020. So far, the requested shift toward organic farming has not occurred at the anticipated level. Organic farming began in Norway with a few pioneers who questioned the conditions in conventional agriculture. Since the late 1980s, there has been a rise in the number of organic farms from the core 20 or so original farms to approximately 2800 certified organic farms in 2010. While several studies have explored the diffusion of organic farming as an innovation, little research has been carried out to specifically understand the spatial diffusion of organic agriculture. This paper explores spatial diffusion of organic farming in Norway by asking if the level of organic farming in one municipality is influenced by organic farming in its neighbouring municipalities. Spatial analyses are carried out on population, agricultural production and producer data. The dependent variable is the proportion of organic production in Norwegian municipalities (N = 430). Analyses in the paper show a connection between the level of organic production, the population level in the municipalities, and access to consumers. This research also shows a connection between the farm processing of organic products and the level of organic farming. The patterns are of a geographical nature, showing neighbourhood effects in the development of organic farming that are especially strong in particular regions of Norway. The results are discussed in light of previous research on organic farming and Hagerstrands ([1953] 1967) theory of spatial diffusion of innovations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - With food security increasingly seen as an urban concern, urban agriculture (UA) has emerged as one strategy for improving access to healthy, affordable food within cities in the Global North. This research evaluates the contributions of three types of urban gardens in Santa Clara County, California, to food security. Survey, interview and harvest data were collected from home gardeners, community gardeners and gardeners participating in community food security (CFS) programs, which provide low-income families with the materials and training to grow their own vegetables. To assess food security we use a multi-dimensional framework that encompasses food availability, accessibility, nutritional adequacy and cultural acceptability as well as agency within the food system. Over the summer of 2015, median garden production ranged from 26 kg for participants in CFS programs to 56 kg for home gardeners. All garden types produced enough produce for at least one adult to consume the number of cups of vegetables recommended by federal nutritional guidelines. Gardening also increased some low-income gardeners' access to healthy food, allowing them to have the diet they wanted-one high in organically grown vegetables-but could not otherwise afford to purchase. Interviews showed that gardeners do not think of cultural acceptability strictly in terms of the presence of certain types of cultural crops; they also articulated a broader set of values concerning the environmental and social conditions of food production. At all income levels, gardeners frequently described a set of food values related to knowledge, control, trust, freshness, flavor, organic production methods and sharing, which they were able to enact through gardening. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the nutritional contributions that urban gardens make but also highlight the importance that low-income gardeners place on having food that aligns with their cultural and ethical values and being able to exercise greater autonomy in making food choices. In conclusion, we suggest that more robust, holistic assessments of UA's contributions to food security will include the subjective aspects of food as well as quantitative measures related to food production.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: This study aimed at evaluating the dietary intakes of Korean adolescents affected by food insecurity, in comparison with those who were food secure. SUBJECTS/METHODS: The study used one day 24-hour dietary recall data from the 6th Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The study subjects consisted of 1,453 adolescents of whom 695 were middle school-aged and 758 were high school-aged. Food security status was assessed using the 18-item questionnaire. Nutrient intake was evaluated in terms of nutrient density, insufficient intake, and excessive intake for selected nutrients, in addition to meeting the appropriate range for total energy intake and energy intakes from carbohydrate, sugar, protein, fat, and saturated fatty acids. Food intake was evaluated in terms of food group servings and dietary diversity score (DDS). RESULTS: The percentages of food insecurity were 11.1% for middle school-aged adolescents and 16.8% for high school-aged adolescents. Food insecure middle school-aged adolescents had higher intake of carbohydrate (P = 0.006) but lower intake of fat (P = 0.010) and saturated fatty acids (P = 0.005) than their food secure counterparts although the intake of both groups was in the recommended ranges. Nutrient intake among high school-aged adolescents was generally similar regardless of food security status. Both food secure and insecure adolescents showed insufficient intake of vitamin A, vitamin C, and calcium, and excessive sodium intake. They additionally had low prevalence of meeting appropriate intake ranges for energy, carbohydrate, and sugar. Food intake in terms of food group servings and DDS was also similar regardless of food security status among both age groups, with low intakes of foods from fruit and dairy groups. CONCLUSIONS: Except for a few nutrients among the middle school-aged adolescents, dietary intakes among Korean adolescents did not differ by food security status in this study.

AB  - Although food security is traditionally defined with four dimensions, there are increasing calls for an additional two: agency and sustainability. However, it is especially challenging to measure agency, a person's control over their food production and consumption. Measuring women's agency is especially critical in African regions south of the Sahara, where women play prominent roles in farming and food preparation. This paper explores the feasibility of creating a metric to measure agency within food systems using data related to food security and dietary diversity among female rice farmers in southwestern Burkina Faso. Informed by the literature on agency, autonomy, and food sovereignty, we developed an agency index based upon a subset of questions in the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS). We call this metric the Food Consumption Agency Metric (FCAM). By applying the FCAM, we then sought to understand how agency complements our understanding and measurement of food security. In exploring the relationship between agency and food security more broadly, we found that agency can be quantified in a way that increases its accessibility to policymakers to create more just food systems and expand how we approach food justice.

AB  - In the last few years, while the COVID-19 pandemic affects food supply chains around the world, the agriculture sector also has faced many global problems, such as global warming, environmental pollution, climate change, and weather disasters. It has known that technological opportunities are available for human beings to get out of these predicaments, solving the interconnections between food-water-energy-climate nexus, and achieving agricultural transformation from traditional to digital. The aim of this review is to gain holistic solutions in a systematic view, based on water-energy-food resources to agricultural digital transformation that will play role in sustainable development. The transition from primitive to digital is given with road maps covering agricultural and industrial revolutions at four stages on timeline. Digital agriculture combined under precision agriculture and Agriculture 4.0 are handled based on domains covering monitoring, control, prediction, and logistics. Digital technologies are explained with application examples such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence, decision support systems, etc. Wearable sensor technologies, real-time monitoring systems tracking whole conditions of animals in livestock, the IoT-based irrigation and fertilization systems that help enhance the efficiency of irrigation processes and minimize water and fertilizer losses in agricultural fields and greenhouses, blockchain-based electronic agriculture, and solutions based on drones and robotics that reduce herbicide and pesticide use are handled systematically. Moreover, renewable energy technologies to be provided synergy between technologies such as agrivoltaics and aquavoltaics combining food and energy production in rural are explained, besides solar-powered pivot and drip irrigation systems and environmental monitoring systems. As a result, for a sustainable future, technological innovations that increase crop productivity and improve crop quality, protect the environment, provide efficient resource use and decrease input costs can help us facing in agriculture of today overwhelm many the economic, social, and environmental challenges.

AB  - In Africa, protected areas can play an important role in mitigating the effects of climate change through carbon sequestration but they are threatened due to increasing land degradation and deforestation (LDD). The Total Wildlife Reserve of Bontioli (TWRB) in Burkina Faso is one of the country's refuges with high biodiversity. This reserve is seriously threatened by human activities, and little information is available about the on-site causes of degradation extent. This study was carried out to investigate drivers and extent of LDD in the TWRB. Household surveys, focus group discussions and field observations were used to identify socio-economic factors that influence land use and land cover (LULC) changes. The socio-economic data were analyzed using rankings and binary logistic regression techniques. Logistic regression model was used to establish the relationship between socio-economic drivers and land cover change. Remote sensing and GIS techniques were used to analyze land use and LULC changes over 29 years, employing Landsat images of 1984, 2001 and 2013. We performed a supervised classification based on the maximum likelihood algorithm to derive vegetation maps. The results revealed significant (p < 0.05) LULC change from one class of LULC to another. From 1984 to 2001, tree savannas, bare soils and agricultural lands increased by 17.55%, 18.79% and 21778.79%, respectively, while woodland, gallery forest, shrub savannas and water bodies decreased by 22.02%, 5.03%, 40.08% and 31.2%, respectively. From 2001 to 2013, gallery forests decreased by 14.33%, tree savannas by 22.30% and shrub savannas by 5.14%, while agricultural lands increased by 167.87% and woodlands by 3.21%. LDD occurred at a higher rate in areas bordering the reserve compared to the core-protected area and the inaccessible areas. Agricultural expansion and wood cutting activities were the main direct causes of LDD. Extensive land utilization for agriculture is a major threat to the conservation of biodiversity in this reserve. The research highlighted the soundness of GIS and remote sensing practical application to assess vegetation change extent in Burkina Faso. Understanding the signal extent of vegetation change is particularly important to support efforts by policy makers to halt or at least to slow down the deforestation in the country. There is a need to control the immediate causes of LULC dynamics by limiting agricultural land expansion and wood cutting in the study area. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background COVID-19 caused a significant impact on food security; particularly among low- and middle-income countries. The objective of the current study was to assess both the direct and indirect impact of COVID-19 on individuals' food security in the metropolitan and regional context of Ethiopia. Methods This project utilized a retrospective study design with a mixed methods approach. It assessed the food insecurity experience of individuals both before and after the emergence of COVID-19 through the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES). Food sellers were interviewed to identify the factors that increased post-COVID-19 emergence food insecurity. Inferential analysis using ordinal logistic regression was undertaken based on the Polytomous Universal Model (PLUM) procedure. Results The size of the family and the type of work for income generation were statistically associated (p < 0.05) with the food security of individuals, both before and after COVID-19 emergence. Location (p = 0.002, odds = 0.37), age (p = 0.002, odds = 2.57) and educational status (p = 0.001, odds = 0.24/) of individuals had a statistically significant effect on the food security of individuals before COVID-19 emergence only. The ordinal value of all FIES indicators increased after COVID-19 emergence compared with pre-pandemic food insecurity. Overall food security of individuals was reduced by 21.5%, with the moderate and severe food insecurity of individuals increasing by 13.1% and 15.9%, respectively. The COVID-19 preventive measures that affected the individuals' food security, in the order of their priority, were: transport bans; food price increment; lockdown measures; job loss; market bans; social distance restrictions; fear of the pandemic; movement restrictions; over-buying; food inaccessibility; and, lack of cash due to bank closure. In addition, pre-existing non-pandemic related natural and man-made disasters played a role in the food security crisis, including drought, war, and desert locust emergence. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has directly and indirectly affected individuals' food security. Learning from the experiences of COVID-19 may assist governments in preparing for future pandemics. Suggested improvements include forming impact reduction task forces and establishing disease prevention strategies that will not compromise food security.

AB  - The city of Portland, Oregon, is often hailed in news and popular media as the capital of the U.S. alternative food movement. In 2002, the Portland Multnomah Food Policy Council (PMFPC) was established to address the region's growing interest in cultivating a sustainable local food system. Council members contributed to many notable achievements, including a healthy corner store initiative, a beginning farmer training program, and changes to zoning codes to expand urban agriculture. However, the PMFPC was dissolved in the summer of 2012 after local government agencies expressed that the council was losing relevancy. After a decade of conducting food policy and advocacy work in a region praised for fostering both citizen engagement and sustainable food systems, what can we learn from the story of the PMFPC? In this reflective case study, we explore the challenges associated with citizen engagement in local food policy. Through semistructured interviews and analysis of PMFPC documents, we provide insight into how particular obstacles might have been avoided or overcome. Our research speaks to the broad arena of public participation and highlights the importance of negotiating and clearly articulating the roles and responsibilities of council members, government staff liaisons, and elected officials; regularly evaluating the usefulness of established roles, structures, and processes; and making the changes necessary to maintain the relevance of the council throughout its life. We conclude with lessons learned and recommendations for both citizens and government agencies hoping to foster productive public engagement and to advance local food systems policy.

AB  - Moderate grazing has been widely proven to improve ecosystem functioning and have profound effects on the carbon cycling and storage in grassland ecosystems, which highly depend on grazing duration and grassland type. However, the effects of moderate grazing durations on carbon sequestration with different grassland types over broad geographic scales across China remain underexplored in the context of striving for carbon neutrality. Here, we explored the prob-ably different responses of carbon sequestration to moderate grazing duration for temperate and alpine grasslands based on 129 published literatures regarding the China's grasslands. The results showed the soil organic carbon stocks were significantly increased during short-term (<5 years) grazing duration, while significantly decreased during medium-(5-10 years) and long-term (>= 10 years) grazing durations in temperate grasslands. However, the soil or-ganic carbon stocks were significantly decreased during short-term grazing duration, while showed no significant changes during medium-and long-term grazing durations in alpine grasslands. The changes in soil organic stock were significantly positively correlated with the changes in belowground biomass, root:shoot, and microbial biomass carbon (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that the temperate grasslands change from carbon sink to carbon source with moderate grazing duration increasing, while the alpine grasslands present an opposite change pattern from carbon source to carbon sink, regulated by grazing-altered carbon input and microbial activities. Our study might have signif-icant implications for future sustainable management practices for carbon sequestration of China's grasslands.

AB  - Management practices such as tillage, crop rotation, irrigation, organic and inorganic inputs application are known to influence diversity and function of soil microbial populations. In this study, we investigated the effect of conventional versus organic farming systems at low and high input levels on structure and diversity of prokaryotic microbial communities. Soil samples were collected from the ongoing long-term farming system comparison trials established in 2007 at Chuka and Thika in Kenya. Physicochemical parameters for each sample were analyzed. Total DNA and RNA amplicons of variable region (V4-V7) of the 16S rRNA gene were generated on an Illumina platform using the manufacturer's instructions. Diversity indices and statistical analysis were done using QIIME2 and R packages, respectively. A total of 29,778,886 high quality reads were obtained and assigned to 16,176 OTUs at 97% genetic distance across both 16S rDNA and 16S rRNA cDNA datasets. The results pointed out a histrionic difference in OTUs based on 16S rDNA and 16S rRNA cDNA. Precisely, while 16S rDNA clustered by site, 16S rRNA cDNA clustered by farming systems. In both sites and systems, dominant phylotypes were affiliated to phylumActinobacteria,ProteobacteriaandAcidobacteria. Conventional farming systems showed a higher species richness and diversity compared to organic farming systems, whilst 16S rRNA cDNA datasets were similar. Physiochemical factors were associated differently depending on rRNA and rDNA. Soil pH, electrical conductivity, organic carbon, nitrogen, potassium, aluminium, zinc, iron, boron and micro-aggregates showed a significant influence on the observed microbial diversity. The observed higher species diversity in the conventional farming systems can be attributed to the integration of synthetic and organic agricultural inputs. These results show that the type of inputs used in a farming system not only affect the soil chemistry but also the microbial population dynamics and eventually the functional roles of these microbes.

AB  - Home gardens are traditional agroforestry systems that promote plant diversity and ecosystem services while also having direct and positive impacts on human livelihoods. Even though home gardens are considered biodiversity hotspots and have recently been recognised as essential for their role in tropical biodiversity conservation, the benefits of ecosystem services provided by home gardens are understudied. This study investigated plant diversity and ecosystem services in tropical home gardens in the Aceh Timur region of Indonesia. Data was collected from 180 home gardens in 12 villages and recorded 173 plant species associated with 16 ecosystem services. The majority of the cultivated plants were fruit and vegetable plants, which played an important role in supporting food security and household income. Home gardens, with their plant species diversity and ecosystem services, played an important role in biodiversity conservation. Home gardens were important not only for improving household livelihoods, but also for the conservation of plant genetic resources and nearby protected forests.

AB  - Bioenergy (i.e., bioheat and bioelectricity) could simultaneously address energy insecurity and climate change. However, bioenergy's impact on climate change remains incomplete when land use changes (LUC), soil organic carbon (SOC) changes, and the auxiliary energy consumption are not accounted for in the life cycle. Using data collected from Belgian farmers, combined heat and power (CHP) operators, and a life cycle approach, we compared 40 bioenergy pathways to a fossil-fuel CHP system. Bioenergy required between 0.024 and 0.204 MJ (0.86 MJ(th) + 0.14 MJ(el))(-1), and the estimated energy ratio (energy output-to-input ratio) ranged from 5 to 42. SOC loss increased the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of residue based bioenergy. On average, the iLUC represented similar to 67% of the total GHG emissions of bioenergy from perennial energy crops. However, the net LUC (i.e., dLUC + iLUC) effects substantially reduced the GHG emissions incurred during all phases of bioenergy production from perennial crops, turning most pathways based on energy crops to GHG sinks. Relative to fossil-fuel based CHP all bioenergy pathways reduced GHG emissions by 8-114%. Fluidized bed technologies maximize the energy and the GHG benefits of all pathways. The size and the power-to-heat ratio for a given CHP influenced the energy and GHG performance of these bioenergy pathways. Even with the inclusion of LUC, perennial crops had better GHG performance than agricultural and forest residues. Perennial crops have a high potential in the multidimensional approach to increase energy security and to mitigate climate change. The full impacts of bioenergy from these perennial energy crops must, however, be assessed before they can be deployed on a large scale. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Land use change and check-dam construction have been widely considered as the major measures to reduce soil and water loss. However, whether catchments behave as sources or sinks of soil carbon and nitrogen based on the combined performance of land use change and check-dam construction in sub catchment systems are still poorly known. To quantitatively assess the effect of land use change and check-dam construction on soil organic carbon (SOC) and total soil nitrogen (TSN) stocks, and to explore the dominate factor influencing SOC and TSN sequestration potential, three sub-catchments controlled by check-dams were selected in the small catchment on the loess plateau of China. The SOC and TSN content and soil physic-chemical properties were analyzed under different land use types (farmland, grassland, shrubland, forestland, and check-dam land). Results clearly showed that the conversion from farmland to grassland and forestland induced an increase of SOC and TSN (1.32-fold C and 1.36-fold N increase in grassland and 1.24-fold C and 1.20-fold N increase in forestland, respectively). Comparing sediments to the corresponding source soil, the average enrichment ratios (ER) for SOC and TSN in sediments trapped behind check-dams were lower than 1 (0.56 +/- 0.10 and 0.65 +/- 0.12, respectively), and check-dam construction induced a net C and N loss (19.38% and 10.61%, respectively). The amount of SOC and TSN in three sub-catchments showed a significant positive correlation with the controlled watershed area (P<0.05). High proportion of forestland and years after construction contributed positively to SOC and TSN stocks per unit area in check-dam (P<0.05), indicating that the controlled watershed area, forestland fraction, and years after construction other than soil erosion were also the dominate influencing factors to affect carbon and nitrogen sequestration potential. The results indicated that, although erosion-induced soils and associated SOC and TSN were redistributed at the landscape scale, land use change and check dam construction might still cause the catchment to behave as soil C and N sinks within the soil erosion subsystem since the 1999s.

AB  - Agriculture sector is vital to ensure global food security and eradicate poverty in rural areas but climate change poses a great threat to this sector especially in developing countries due to lower adaptive capacity of farming community in these countries. Farming community can minimize the impact of climate change on agriculture by adopting climate change strategies at their farms. Therefore, this study analyzed how farmers perceive climate change, which strategies they adopt to minimize the impact of climate change at their farms, and the influential factors affecting the adoption of these strategies. For this purpose, cross sectional data of 195 farmers selected through multi stage purposive and random sampling techniques were collected in a face to face survey and multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the factors affecting adoption of climate change strategies. Climate change is no more a mystery for the farmers and farming community perceive this variability very well. Majority of the farmers perceived an increase in both summer as well as winter temperatures. Farming community in the area was adopting conventional climate change strategies such as changing in crop cultivation dates, new crop varieties, crop diversification, mix farming, and intensified use of chemicals at their farms in order to minimize the climate changes. Adoption of climate change strategies at farm level was influenced by schooling years, age, machinery ownership, market distance, agricultural labor force, extension services and total land of the farmers. Therefore, extension services, and improving road infrastructure to enhance market access are essential to increase adoption of climate change strategies among farmers.

AB  - Biofortification is a new agricultural intervention to alleviate hidden hunger in China and even the world. Exploring the impact of farmers' adoption of biofortification on return on investment (ROI), which is calculated from farmers' production net income and profitability, can provide empirical support for the development of sustainable agriculture. This paper examines the impact of the adoption of biofortification on ROI using cross-sectional data from a survey of farmers in China. An endogenous switching regression model that accounts for selection bias was used in the research. The empirical results revealed that the adoption of biofortification has a positive and statistically significant impact on ROI. A heterogeneity analysis also revealed that comparatively high annual income adopters and female adopters tend to benefit more from the adoption of biofortification than middle- and low-income adopters and male adopters.

AB  - Complex agroforests have been promoted as a potential solutions to address trade-offs between environmental conservation efforts and the need for increased agricultural productivity for smallholder farmers in the tropics. However, the effects of tree diversification on soil fertility in tropical agroforests remain unclear. In this study, we examine whether tree diversification in cocoa plantations is associated with soil fertility benefits and can contribute to soil restoration after deforestation. We tested for positive associations between increasing tree species diversity and increased soil aggregation, soil nutrients and microbial communities across a diversity gradient ranging from cocoa monocultures to complex cocoa agroforests. Secondary forests and primary forests were used as reference ecosystems. Increase in tree diversity within cocoa plantations did not increase soil fertility parameters in topsoil layers or cocoa yields. Mean soil C contents were 8% lower, mean weight diameter of aggregates 48% lower and total bacterial biomass 35% lower in cocoa plantations than in primary and secondary forest systems, whereas soil P content was 22% higher. Across all land-use systems, microbial biomass was greater in sites with higher soil carbon contents and soil aggregation. This suggests soil function restoration in terms of microbial communities, soil C and aggregate stabilization in secondary forests. However, in cocoa plantations tree diversification alone may not be an effective solution to mitigate soil degradation after deforestation. Rather, preserving remaining forests or promoting farming approaches that allow for secondary forest regeneration (e.g. implementing forest strips and regular fallow rotations) might have a more substantial impact on soil health.

AB  - This study utilized the contingent valuation method to estimate the value of water-related ecosystem services (ES) in Vietnam, focusing on provisioning and regulating services for addressing water scarcity (WS) in rice farming. By incorporating gender and climate change perceptions, it expanded the existing literature on valuing river ecosystem services. The findings showed a significant number of households experiencing severe water scarcity in the past five years, with over 70% facing occasional or regular WS in the last 12 months. Rice farmers were willing to adopt coping measures and preventive practices to preserve water-related ES, recognizing their importance for sustaining rice cultivation. Farmers demonstrated willingness to contribute financially to restore and maintain water-related ES in rivers and canals. The median willingness to pay for restoration was VND188,300/ha, with estimated values of US$2,898,133 for a 10% affected area and US$23,185,068 for an 80% affected area over five years. Perception of WS severity and associated risk positively influenced households' decisions to contribute financially. These findings have policy implications and provide insights for effective coping strategies against WS, enhancing water-resilient agriculture in the Lower Mekong Basin.

AB  - Context: Black soil farmland protection is a necessary measure in China to achieve sustainable, high-quality farmland development. Biochar, as a new type of soil amendment, has been shown to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase crop yields. However, few studies have addressed the widespread application of biochar from a productivity perspective. Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the productivity of farmland regulation measures to provide information that can be used for monitoring and comparison. The strengths and weaknesses of different tillage practices in soils with different gradients of biochar application and further targets for improvement were determined. Methods: In this work, a three-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach combined with a superefficiency measurement (Super-SBM) model with slack was used to study the production efficiency of 40 experimental plots at the Acheng Experimental Site, using soil greenhouse gas emissions as an undesired output. The dynamics of productivity in the experimental plots were explored after the influences of the external environment and statistical noise were removed. Results and conclusions: The results showed that biochar could significantly inhibit soil greenhouse gas emissions, and deep tillage and the application of 500 kg mu- 1 biochar resulted in the greatest emission reductions. Tillage and the market price of crops increase on-farm productivity by influencing the input redundancy of biochar and seeds. Family-type agricultural management entities can optimise environmental protection and economic efficiency by selecting different farmland regulation measures, which include the following: 1) Deep ploughing and the application of 500-558.74 kg mu-1 biochar for hard-grain corn are suitable for family farms. 2) Deep ploughing and the application of 500-504.72 kg mu-1 biochar for sticky corn are suitable for large-scale growers. 3) Deep ploughing and the application of 0-40.43 kg mu-1 biochar for sticky corn are suitable for traditional farmers. Significance: This study provides feasible options for the sustainable and green application of biochar under different agricultural management conditions. It can be used as a general pattern and extended to other agricultural management entities that show inefficient agricultural production.

A crucial issue is thus to assess the trade-offs between social and ecological impacts and the benefits of converting additional land to cropland. In the former Soviet Union countries, where the transition from state-command to market-driven economies resulted in widespread agricultural land abandonment, cropland expansion may incur relatively low costs, especially compared with tropical regions. Our objectives were to quantify the drivers, constraints and trade-offs associated with recultivating abandoned cropland to assess the potentially available cropland in European Russia, western Siberia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan the region where the vast majority of post-Soviet cropland abandonment took place. Using spatial panel regressions, we characterized the socio-economic determinants of cropland abandonment and recultivation. We then used recent maps of changes in cropland to (i) spatially characterize the socio-economic, accessibility and soil constraints associated with the recultivation of abandoned croplands and (ii) investigate the environmental trade-offs regarding carbon stocks and habitat for biodiversity. Less cropland abandonment and more recultivation after 2000 occurred in areas with an increasing rural population and a younger labor force, but also improved yields. Synergies were observed between cropland recultivation and intensification over the 2000s. From 47.3 million hectares (Mha) of cropland abandoned in 2009, we identified only 8.5 (7.1-17.4) Mha of potentially available cropland with low environmental trade-offs and low to moderate socio-economic or accessibility constraints that were located on high-quality soils (Chernozems). These areas represented an annual wheat production potential of similar to 14.3 (9.6-19.5) million tons (Mt). Conversely, 8.5 (4.2-12.4) Mha had high carbon or biodiversity trade-offs, of which similar to 10% might be attractive for cropland expansion and thus would require protection from recultivation. Agro-environmental, accessibility, and socio-economic constraints suggested that the remaining 30.6 (25.7-30.6) Mha of abandoned croplands were unlikely to provide important contributions to future crop production at current wheat prices but could provide various ecosystem services, and some could support extensive livestock production. Political and institutional support could foster recultivation by supporting investments in agriculture and rural demographic revitalization. Reclaiming potentially available cropland in the study region could provide a notable contribution to global grain production, with relatively low environmental trade-offs compared with tropical frontiers, but is not a panacea to address global issues of food security or reduce land-use pressure on tropical ecosystems.

AB  - Beef cattle feedlots are estimated to contribute 26% of U.S. agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and future climate change policy could target reducing these emissions. Life cycle assessment (LCA) of GHG emissions from U.S. grain-fed beef cattle was conducted based on industry statistics and previous studies to identify the main sources of uncertainty in these estimations. Uncertainty associated with GHG emissions from indirect land use change, pasture soil emissions (e.g. soil carbon sequestration), enteric fermentation from cattle on pasture, and methane emissions from feedlot manure, respectively, contributed the most variability to life cycle GHG emissions from beef production. Feeding of coproducts from ethanol production was estimated to reduce life cycle emissions by 1.7%, but could increase emissions by 0.6-2.0% with higher feeding rates. Monte Carlo simulation found a range of life cycle emissions from 2.52 to 9.58 kg CO2 per kg live weight (5th and 95th percentiles), with a calculated average of 8.14, which is between recent estimates. Current methods used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) associated with beef production in feedlots were found to account for only 3-20% of life cycle GHG emissions.

AB  - The ongoing expansion of global trade and human mobility are causing increased occurrences of biosecurity outbreaks, particularly of invasive pests which threaten biodiversity and agricultural production. Smallholder farmers are particularly vulnerable, as they are generally not well-prepared for such incursions. In Australia, farmers with non-English speaking backgrounds are more likely to be influenced by these increasing risks and may need long-term adaptive support. Understanding farmers' perceptions of biosecurity threats, and what drives these perceptions, is a prerequisite for designing effective biosecurity management policies to support livelihoods and food security. In this study, we aim to understand the perceptions of smallholder farmers' on biosecurity threats and the factors influencing their perceptions. Data was obtained from a survey of 101 Vietnamese farmers across three geographically dispersed locations in Australia (Northern Territory, South Australia, and Western Australia). Using the Protection Motivation Theory, we found that 43% of farmers perceived biosecurity threats to be one of the key agricultural risks, preceded by weather-related risk (48%) and produce price fluctuations (45%). Belief in the existence of biosecurity threats and the sources of information on biosecurity matters had a significant positive influence on farmers' overall perceptions of biosecurity threats on four dimensions of their life. English levels had a significant influence on their perceptions of biosecurity threats on crop output whereas farm size, gender, and farmers' age did not significantly affect farmers' overall perceptions of biosecurity threats. The findings of this study could be used by government agencies and industry associations to better target support for farmers to minimise the threats of pest and disease incursions. Support could be delivered through the introduction of relevant extension services and education programs with more transparent and direct communications of risk and compliances, improving farmers' knowledge and belief in biosecurity and fostering trust between farmers and the government.

AB  - PurposeWhile the application of blockchain technology in the organic food supply chain has been increasingly recognized, the extant knowledge of how blockchain-driven traceability influences consumer perceptions and purchase intentions remains underexplored. Grounded in the stimulus-organism-response theory, this study aims to construct a moderated mediation model to examine blockchain-enabled traceability's direct and indirect impacts on organic food purchase intention through perceived blockchain-related information transparency, considering the moderating role of blockchain-based trust.Design/methodology/approachA purposive sample of 5,326 Vietnamese consumers was surveyed using the PROCESS macro to test the proposed hypotheses.FindingsThe findings indicate that blockchain-enabled traceability significantly enhances perceived blockchain-related information transparency, which positively influences organic food purchase intention. Furthermore, blockchain-based trust was found to positively moderate both the direct effect of transparency on purchase intention and the indirect impact of traceability on purchase intention through transparency.Practical implicationsPractical and managerial insights for stakeholders in the organic food sector are also discussed.Originality/valueThese results contribute to the literature by extending the stimulus-organism-response model to the context of blockchain technology in supply chains and highlighting the critical role of trust in moderating the effectiveness of technological innovations.

AB  - Tropical deforestation has been one of the most significant global environmental changes of recent decades and has spurred a substantial academic literature. Despite this, the empirical literature provides inconsistent evidence on the role of basic economic determinants of deforestation such as income and population. The authors suggest that one explanation for this inconsistency is a tendency to use incomplete or incorrect dynamic regression specifications. They derive three plausible dynamic empirical model specifications and compare their performance both with each other and with an ad hoc model typical of those used in the literature. Statistical tests support the use of more completely specified models which allow for dynamic adjustment of forest cover.

AB  - There is an urgent demand to update eco-compensation standards for organic farming since unfair distribution that might hamper smallholders' incentives to green practices. However, the current payment method is inadequate because it fails to fully consider internalities (i.e., economic costs, labor opportunity costs) and externalities (i.e., environmental costs, ecosystem services), especially for organic farming households in ecologically sensitive regions. Hence, in this study, we presented a framework for reaching fair distribution of eco-compensation in organic farming under dynamic variations of internalities and externalities together with spatial heterogeneity. The core objective of this framework was maximizing the fairness of eco-compensation by allowing for spatial heterogeneity of the eco-compensation benchmark obtained by the net value of ecosystem services (NVES). Furthermore, the proposed framework was tested using a case study of tea production in Simao District, Puer City, Yunnan Province, China, involving conventional tea farms (CTFs), organic tea farms (OTFs), and organic rain tea farms (ORTFs). The results show that the NVES (OTFs = 17,446.06 USD center dot ha(-1)center dot a, ORTFs = 18,723.29 USD center dot ha(-1)center dot a, and CTFs = 15,274.67 USD center dot ha(-1)center dot a) accurately reflected the impact of organic farming on both nature and society. The benchmark dynamics analysis based on the bonding of the NVES and organic farming development stages indicate that the government only needs to provide eco-compensation during the initial and growth stages of organic farming. Moreover, the economic-ecological synergy scenario (OTFs = 2000.97 USD center dot ha(-1)center dot a, ORTFs = 3176.23 USD center dot ha(-1)center dot a) represented the most reasonable way of determining appropriate eco-compensation for organic farming. In summary, this framework offered policymakers a tool of determining the eco-compensation standards and distributing eco-compensation fairly to organic farmers based on temporal and spatial heterogeneity.

AB  - Eco-innovations that reduce the environmental effect of manufacturing and consumption are seen as critical components of sustainable development and a critical component of the transition to a circular economy. Food systems address the issue of food waste, which is generally acknowledged as a cost to the economy, the environment, and society. Eco-innovations seem to be critical for the food system's transformation to a more circular model centered on sustainable food production and processing. The goal of this paper was to determine the variables that influenced the introduction of product, process, organizational, and marketing innovations in European Union agri-food enterprises between 2012 and 2014. According to a preliminary analysis of the data, 57.40% of agribusinesses did not implement any form of innovation, which prompted the authors to study the difficulties surrounding innovation development over the 3-year reference period. Several key factors emerge as significant influences on the introduction of product innovations (0.055*); contractual requirements as significant influences on the introduction of process innovations (-0.081*); and environmental incentives as significant influences on the introduction of marketing innovations (0.062*). Additionally, product (0.704*) and process (1.051*) innovations tend to have a greater influence on enterprises' views of circular benefits. The investigation also demonstrates how enterprises and end users interpret the effect of various forms of innovation differently. Indeed, end users, in contrast to how enterprises understand it, believe that organizational (0.611*) and marketing (0.916*) innovations are critical in pursuing circular benefits.

AB  - This paper examines the ecological threat of tobacco farming in Urambo District, the leading producer of flue-cured tobacco in Tanzania with other major producers being Tabora, Iringa and Chunya Districts. Structured interviews were conducted in four villages while 39 Modified-Whittacker plots were laid in tobacco fallow lands for inventory of woody species to ascertain ecological performance and the impact of tobacco on species diversity, richness and standing stock functions. There was higher than expected species richness with a total of 115 tree and shrub species identified. Tobacco farming showed no significant negative effect on the floristic composition and stem density. However, the significantly reduced biomass and change in vegetation structure illustrate the potential loss in ecological function of the woodlands. Land clearing for tobacco planting account to an annual deforestation of 3.5% while on average a farmer requires 23 m(3) of stacked wood only for curing per season which adds another 3% of deforestation. Shifting cultivation is no longer sustainable given the shortened fallow periods of 4 years. Improved barn structures, alternative sources of fuel like coal, tree planting, mixed cropping and cash crops that are environment friendly are recommended for ecological restoration.

AB  - IntroductionReduction of food loss in the horticultural sector is critical to simultaneously support the transition toward a diet with higher consumption of vegetables and the achievement of policy goals aimed at halving the quantity of wastage by 2030. However, the lack of precise information and the presence of multiple interconnected factors makes it difficult to assess the potential socioeconomic benefits and therefore the decision-making process of food loss reduction strategies. MethodsA case study approach has been used to assess the economic loss and nutrional impact of food loss in the horticulture primary production. The selection of the main vegetable products was based on an historical series while economic and nutritional impact were estimated starting from national and European indicator. ResultsThe food loss correspond to 26% of the total production and 14% of the total agricultural production economic value. The social analysis confirm the possibility of redistributing food loss among the population even in the most critical months and areas. DiscussionThe combination of social and economic indicator resulted essential to provide key information at the decision-making level to pave the way for the elaboration of short- and long-term food loss reduction strategies. Indeed, no single-bullet strategy can be applied to overcome the problem of food loss as many actor with different needs are involved.

AB  - Biochar application to soil has been proposed as a means for reducing soil greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change. The effects, however, of interactions between biochar, moisture and temperature on soil CO2 and N2O emissions, remain poorly understood. Furthermore, the applicability of lab-scale observations to field conditions in diverse agroecosystems remains uncertain. Here we investigate the impact of a mixed wood gasification biochar on CO2 and N2O emissions from loess-derived soils using: (1) controlled laboratory incubations at three moisture (27, 31 and 35%) and three temperature (10, 20 and 30 degrees C) levels and (2) a field study with four cropping systems (continuous corn, switchgrass, low diversity grass mix and high diversity grass-forb mix). Biochar reduced N2O emissions under specific temperatures and moistures in the laboratory and in the continuous corn cropping system in the field. However, the effect of biochar on N2O emissions was only significant in the field and no effect on cumulative CO2 emissions was observed. Cropping system also had a significant effect in the field study, with soils in grass and grass-forb cropping systems emitting more CO2 and less N2O than corn cropping systems. Observed biochar effects were consistent with previous studies showing that biochar amendments can reduce soil N2O emissions under specific but not all, conditions. The disparity in N2O emission responses at the lab and field scales suggests that laboratory incubation experiments may not reliably predict the impact of biochar at the field scale.

AB  - The use of recycled materials as soil amendments and fertilizers is an important priority in the agronomic sector to valorize waste from a circular economic perspective and reduce waste disposal, reduce dependence on external inputs, and provide better climate change mitigation options. In this study, we evaluated the agroecological performance of compost derived from recycled organic matrices of urban waste (mixed composted amendment, MCA) of the metropolitan area of Rome. MCA is available in big quantities and might represent an interesting option to substitute conventional mineral nitrogen fertilizer (CF). The effect of MCA, CF, and a combination of both (MIX 1:1) was tested on crop yield and greenhouse gas emissions in a field trial on a common Mediterranean crop (Swiss chart, one season, two crop cycles). The MCA effect on crop yield was positive and comparable to CF and MIX treatments, while MCA treatment showed the lower soil mineral nitrogen (N) content. GHG emissions in the MCA treatment were comparable to those observed in CF and MIX, being overall quite low. The soil acted as a weak net CH4 sink in all treatments (-12.6 +/- 6.1 mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1)); no differences in CO2 emissions between MCA and CF or MIX treatments were observed (range 0.1-0.2 g m(-2) h(-1)). The N2O emission intensity of MCA was slightly lower than MIX and CF treatments (0.09, 0.011, and 0.011 g N2O kg(-1) crop dry weight, respectively). Overall, MCA seemed a valid alternative to CF for the tested agro-environmental indicators in the spring/summer Mediterranean conditions.

AB  - A field experiment was conducted during rabi 2017-18 and 2018-19 at organic farming unit of Instructional Agronomy Farm, Rajasthan College of Agriculture, Udaipur, Rajasthan to study the influence of different concentrations of jeevamrut and its time of application on growth, yield attributes and yield of wheat grown under organic farming. Results revealed that a significant increase in plant height, dry matter accumulation, number of effective tillers, number of spikelets/ear, number of grains/ear, ear length and grain weight/ear, was observed with the application of 10% jeevamrut over control, 4% jeevamrut and 6% jeevamrut. There was no significant difference observed in grain and straw yield of wheat with the application of 4% and 6% jeevamrut over control. However, application of 8% and 10% jeevamrut significantly increased the grain and straw yield of wheat over control. Application of jeevamrut at 60 and 75 DAS significantly increased plant height, dry matter accumulation, number of effective tillers, number of spikelets/ear, number of grains/ear, ear length and grain weight/ear over the application of jeevamrut at 75 and 90 DAS. Application of jeevamrut twice at 60 and 75 DAS and 75 and 90 DAS significantly increased the grain and straw yield of wheat as compared to one time application of jeevamrut 75 and 90 DAS alone. There was no significant interaction found in the concentration of jeevamrut and its time of application.

AB  - Emissions of ammonia and greenhouse gases from animal manure are an environmental concern and new techniques should be carefully examined to establish their effect on emissions across the whole management continuum, including storage operations. Biogas plants are becoming more common at farm facilities and the management of digestate raises some concerns regarding potential emissions to the air when mechanical separation is adopted. The aim of this study was to evaluate how mechanical separation affects ammonia and greenhouse gas emissions from the storage of different fractions obtained from separation of codigested pig and cattle slurries. A laboratory scale experiment was carried out in a temperature controlled room where 25 L of unseparated digestate and the relative solid and liquid fractions were stored in duplicates for 32 days at 17 degrees C. Each manure was sampled weekly for chemical analysis (total nitrogen, ammoniacal nitrogen, total solids, volatile solids and pH). Potential emissions from agitated samples were estimated twice a week using a dynamic chamber technique and acid traps for ammonia and a trace gas analyser for carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Results from chemical analyses indicated that mechanical separation of digested manure increased nitrogen losses during storage when both separated fractions are taken into account, by 35 and 86% for the pig and cattle slurries, respectively. However, the flux measurements from the agitated samples showed that there was a lower potential for ammonia emissions during storage for the separated fractions than the digested unseparated slurry (9 and 23% reductions for the pig and cattle slurries, respectively), probably due to the lower TAN concentration of the liquid fraction. The treatment resulted in a significant reduction (40%) of GHG emissions for cattle slurries but had no consistent effect for pig effluents. The results of this study suggest that adoption of mitigation techniques should be considered for the management of the liquid and solid fractions of digestates in order to reduce the increased environmental impact during storage.

AB  - This study investigated effects of soil amendments with ramial chipped wood (RCW) derived from Gmelina arborea and Sarcocephalus latifolius, together with poultry manure, on soil chemical properties and fungal communities in northern and southern Benin. The trial was a split-plot experiment, where treatments included volume of irrigation water (V1 and V2 = 0.5 *V1) as the whole-plot factor, with organic amendment (45 t/ha RCW; 15 t/ha poultry manure, PM; 45 t/ha RCW + 15 t/ha of PM, RCW_PM; and control) as the sub-plot factor. Topsoil was sampled before and after 24 months of in situ organic amendment application. Humic acid (HA) was extracted from soil and purified prior to FTIR spectroscopy, NMR, and Py-GC-MS analyses. RCW treatments (RCW and RCW_PM) contributed substantially to organic carbon storage and soil nutrient (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) increases (the latter by up to 1.5 times) compared to the control. Accordingly, soils that were amended with the RCW produced significant amounts of HA. High concentrations of lignin-related compounds were determined in pyrolysis products from humic acids in the RCW-amended soils. Using ITS2 region sequencing on the Illumina Miseq platform, RCW amendments markedly altered fungal compositions, with increased relative abundance of Ascomycota (up to 92% of total fungal community), Mucoromycota (2.7%), Basidiomycota (2.5%) and Rozel-lomycota (0.3%). These fungal phyla contain species that participate in organic matter decomposition and compound transformations but did not selectively degrade lignin in RCW. Our results suggest that RCW amendments significantly increased fungal activity and improved soil nutrient availability. Thus, this agro-technology is recommended for regenerative agriculture.

AB  - Regardless of its quantity and quality, soil organic matter can have significant effects on soil and plant nutrient content. There are only a few studies focusing on soil properties and viral disease incidence which investigate the contribution of soil or tissue nutrient contents to disease-suppressive effects. But none of them refers to purple coneflower viruses and nutritional elements of this crop. The aim of our study was investigation of infecting of purple coneflower with viruses under conditions of organic farming. An effective use of organic farming element in medicinal plants cultivation on the example of infection of purple coneflower of 1st and 2d year of vegetation with viruses is revealed. The research results showed that the economically important purple coneflower viruses in Bulgaria are AMV, CMV, TSWV, TMV and PVY. In Ukraine, it was found that the purple coneflower plants are infected with TSWV - in 2012, PVY - in 2013, and TRV - in 2014. The most harmful is CMV, which circulated on the Echinacea purpurea plants for 8 years. One of the most widespread viruses on the purple coneflower culture in both Ukraine and Bulgaria is CMV. Some properties of isolates of this virus were investigated. Significant yield reducing of coneflower under viral infection is shown. The absence of viral diseases and an increase in the productivity of coneflower plants grown under organic farming conditions as compared to control plants was demonstrated. The necessity of optimal supply of plants with nutrients is shown especially when the soil humus content is no less than 5.2%. This is the first report about the reduction of the infection of Echinacea purpurea plants with viruses under conditions of organic farming.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of foliar application of various synthetic compounds and biological extracts against powdery mildew on wheat. Seed coats of winter wheat were treated by synthetical compounds (benzothiadiazole, salicylic acid, and glycine betaine) or by the extracts from plants (oak, giant knotweed, curcuma, and ginger). Then the seeds were planted using small-field experiments with powdery mildew infection (repetitions over a two-year period; experimental field in Ruzyne, Prague). Leaf area infection was measured and the Cumulative Proportion of Leaf Area Diseased (CPLAD) was calculated. Data were analysed using ANOVA (Tukey test, p <= 0.05). Effectiveness of preparations varied 30 % to 72 % in 2008, and 25 % to 65 % in 2009. The most effective synthetical compound was benzothiadiazole and the most effective biological extract was one from giant knotweed in both years (p <= 0.05). Besides, plants treated with salicylic acid or glycine betaine had the least activity against powdery mildew (p <= 0.05). Effectiveness in both years of cultivation was (p > 0.05) similar, which indicates good stability of the biological extracts used. These findings suggest that these biological extracts may be a good preparation for using in organic farming.

AB  - Scientific assessments of agricultural air quality, including estimates of emissions and potential sequestration of greenhouse gases, are an important emerging. area of environmental science that offers significant challenges to policy and regulatory authorities. Improvements are needed in measurements, modeling, emission controls, and farm operation management. Controlling emissions of gases and particulate matter from agriculture is notoriously difficult as this sector affects the most basic need of humans, i.e., food. Current policies combine an inadequate science covering a very disparate range of activities in a complex industry with social and political overlays. Moreover, agricultural emissions derive from both area and point sources. In the United States, agricultural emissions play an important role in several atmospherically mediated processes of environmental and public health concerns. These atmospheric processes affect local and regional environmental quality, including odor, particulate matter (PM) exposure, eutrophication, acidification, exposure to toxics, climate, and pathogens. Agricultural emissions also contribute to the global problems caused by greenhouse gas emissions. Agricultural emissions are variable in space and time and in how they interact within the various processes and media affected. Most important in the U.S. are ammonia (where agriculture accounts for similar to 90% of total emissions), reduced sulfur (unquantified), PM2.5 (similar to 16%), PM10 (similar to 18%), methane (similar to 29%), nitrous oxide (similar to 72%), and odor and emissions of pathogens (both unquantified). Agriculture also consumes fossil fuels for fertilizer production and farm operations, thus emitting carbon dioxide (CO2) oxides of nitrogen (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), and particulates. Current research priorities include the quantification of point and nonpoint sources, the biosphere-atmosphere exchange of ammonia, reduced sulfur compounds, volatile organic compounds, greenhouse gases, odor and pathogens, the quantification of landscape processes, and the primary and secondary emissions of PM. Given the serious concerns raised regarding the amount and the impacts of agricultural air emissions, policies must be pursued and regulations must be enacted in order to make real progress in reducing these emissions and their associated environmental impacts.

AB  - Transient simulations are performed over the entire last millennium with a general circulation model that couples the atmosphere, ocean, and the land surface with a closed carbon cycle. This setup applies a high-detail reconstruction of anthropogenic land cover change (ALCC) as the only forcing to the climate system with two goals: (1) to isolate the effects of ALCC on the carbon cycle and the climate independently of any other natural and anthropogenic disturbance and (2) to assess the importance of preindustrial human activities. With ALCC as only forcing, the terrestrial biosphere experiences a net loss of 96 Gt C over the last millennium, leading to an increase of atmospheric CO2 by 20 ppm. The biosphere-atmosphere coupling thereby leads to a restoration of 37% and 48% of the primary emissions over the industrial (A. D. 1850-2000) and the preindustrial period (A.D. 800-1850), respectively. Because of the stronger coupling flux over the preindustrial period, only 21% of the 53 Gt C preindustrial emissions remain airborne. Despite the low airborne fraction, atmospheric CO2 rises above natural variability by late medieval times. This suggests that human influence on CO2 began prior to industrialization. Global mean temperatures, however, are not significantly altered until the strong population growth in the industrial period. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of historic events such as epidemics and warfare on the carbon budget. We find that only long-lasting events such as the Mongol invasion lead to carbon sequestration. The reason for this limited carbon sequestration is indirect emissions from past ALCC that compensate carbon uptake in regrowing vegetation for several decades. Drops in ice core CO2 are thus unlikely to be attributable to human action. Our results indicate that climate-carbon cycle studies for present and future centuries, which usually start from an equilibrium state around 1850, start from a significantly disturbed state of the carbon cycle.

AB  - Background In recent years, there have been several studies on the remediation of heavy metal pollution in soil by the application of biochar. However, little attention has been paid to understanding the effects and underlying mechanisms of biochar on soil carbon sequestration in manganese- contaminated farmlands. Therefore, in this study, bagasse biochar was applied to the soil in different proportions (0%, 0.5%, 2%, and 5%) and the test was conducted indoors for 100 days at a constant temperature. Soil physical and chemical properties, organic carbon mineralization, organic carbon components, and enzyme activities were analyzed in this study. Results In this study, when compared with the control, the application of 0.5%, 2%, and 5% bagasse biochar to the manganese-contaminated sugarcane field soil effectively reduced the cumulative CO2 emissions, i.e., decreased by 123.18 mg.kg(-1), 208.28 mg.kg(-1), and 287.79 mg.kg(-1), respectively. Among the different treatment groups, the highest decrease in cumulative CO2 emissions was observed in the 5% bagasse biochar-treated soil when compared with the control. The application of bagasse biochar increased the soil microbial biomass carbon content by 12.72 mg.kg(-1), 13.71 mg.kg(-1), and 15.10 mg.kg(-1), respectively when compared with the control. The soil nutrients and enzyme activities significantly increased with the increase in biochar application amount. Conclusions The application of bagasse biochar to manganese- contaminated sugarcane soil field effectively inhibited the mineralization of soil organic carbon, improved the carbon sequestration potential of manganese-contaminated sugarcane field soil, and provided a theoretical basis for the carbon sequestration mechanism in manganesecontaminated farmland soil.

AB  - Soil microorganisms and N cycling are important components of biogeochemical cycling processes. In addition, the study of the effects of nitrification and urease inhibitors on N and microorganisms in greenhouse vegetable fields is essential to reducing N loss and greenhouse gas emissions. The effects of nitrification inhibitors [2-chloro-6-(trichloromethyl) pyridine (CP), dicyandiamide (DCD)], and urease inhibitor [N-(n-butyl) thiophos-phoric triamide (NBPT)] on soil inorganic N (NH4+-N, NO2-N and NO3-N) concentrations and the production rates of greenhouse gases (N2O, CH4, and CO2) in greenhouse vegetable fields were investigated via indoor incubation experiments. Polymerase chain reaction amplification and high-throughput sequencing technology (Illumina Miseq) were used to explore the community structure and abundance changes of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), and denitrifying bacteria (nirK and nirS). The results showed that CP and DCD obviously inhibited NH4+-N conversion, and NO2-N, and NO3-N accumulation, NBPT slowed down urea hydrolysis and NH4+-N production, and the apparent nitrification rates of soil were in the following order: NBPT > DCD > DCD + NBPT > CP + NBPT > CP. Compared with urea treatment, the peak N2O production rate of inhibitor treatment decreased by 73.30-99.30%, and the production rate of CH4 and CO2 decreased by more than 66.16%. DCD and CP reduced the abundance of AOA and AOB, respectively. Further-more, NBPT hindered the growth of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms and nirS-type denitrifying bacteria, and urea and nitrification inhibitors were detrimental to the growth of Ensifer and Sinorhizobium in the nirK com-munity. Nitrification and urease inhibitors can effectively slow down nitrification and greenhouse gas emissions, reduce N loss and improve soil quality by inhibiting the growth of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms and denitrifying bacteria.

AB  - Anthropogenic land-use change causes substantial changes in local and global biodiversity. Rare and common species can differ in sensitivity to land-use change; rare species are expected to be affected more negatively. Rarity may be defined in terms of geographic range size, population density, or breadth of habitat requirements. How these 3 forms of rarity interact in determining global responses to land use is yet to be assessed. Using global data representing 912 vertebrate species, we tested for differences in responses to land use of species characterized by different types of rarity. Land-use responses were fitted using generalized linear mixed-effects models, allowing responses to vary among groups of species with different forms of rarity. Species considered rare with respect to all 3 forms of rarity showed particularly strong declines in disturbed land uses (>40% of species and 30% of individuals in the most disturbed land uses). In contrast, species common both geographically and numerically and with broad habitat requirements showed strong increases (up to 90% increase in species and 40% in abundance in some land uses). Our results suggest that efforts to understand the vulnerability of species to environmental changes should account for different types of rarity where possible. Our results also have potentially important implications for ecosystem functioning, given that rare species may play unique roles within ecosystems.

AB  - In the optimisation of grain yield and quality of wheat, plant distribution is a key factor. In contrast to high yield levels, at moderate levels. widening the row space did not decrease grain yield. To gain information about changes in the quality and yield with changing in row spacings in organic farming systems, experiments were conducted at two locations in the Swiss midlands in 2001/2002. Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L., cv. Titlis) was directly drilled in rows 0.1875 and 0.3750 in apart at the same seeding rate per area. An unfertilised treatment and the usual application of 60 m(3) ha(-1) liquid farmyard manure were compared. While the grain yield was not decreased by the wider row spacing, the thousand kernel weight (TKW), and grain protein content were increased from 42.6 to 43.5 a and from 11.7 to 12.7 %, respectively, compared to the narrow row spacing. Liquid manure, on average of both experimental sites, increased the yield (from 3.725 to 4.765 Mg ha(-1)) and the grain protein content (from 12.0 to 12.5 %). Doubling the space between the rows from 0.1875 to 0.3750 in seemed to be a suitable strategy for managing directly drilled winter wheat in organic farming systems. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Acid rain is one of the severest environmental issues globally. Relative to other global changes (e.g., warming, elevated atmospheric [CO2], and nitrogen deposition), however, acid rain has received less attention than its due. Soil fauna play important roles in multiple ecological processes, but how soil fauna community responds to acid rain remains less studied. This microcosm experiment was conducted using latosol with simulated acid rain (SAR) manipulations to observe potential changes in soil fauna community under acid rain stress. Four pH levels, i.e., pH 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, and 5.5, and a neutral control of pH 7.0 were set according to the current pH condition and acidification trend of precipitation in southern China. As expected, we observed that the SAR treatments induced changes in soil fauna community composition and their ecological niches in the tested soil; the treatment effects tended to increase as acidity increased. This could be attributable to the environmental stresses (such as acidity, porosity and oxygen supply) induced by the SAR treatments. In addition to direct acidity effect, we propose that potential changes in permeability and movability of water and oxygen in soils induced by acid rain could also give rise to the observed shifts in soil fauna community composition. These are most likely indirect pathways of acid rain to affect belowground community. Moreover, we found that nematodes, the dominating soil fauna group in this study, moved downwards to mitigate the stress of acid rain. This is probably detrimental to soil fauna in the long term, due to the relatively severer soil conditions in the deep than surface soil layer. Our results suggest that acid rain could change soil fauna community and the vertical distribution of soil fauna groups, consequently changing the underground ecosystem functions such as organic matter decomposition and greenhouse gas emissions.

AB  - Residue management in cropping systems is believed to improve soil quality. However, the effects of residue management on methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from paddy field in Southern China have not been well researched. The emissions of CH4 and N2O were investigated in double cropping rice (Oryza sativa L.) systems with straw returning of different winter cover crops by using the static chamber-gas chromatography technique. A randomized block experiment with three replications was established in 2004 in Hunan Province, China, including rice-rice-ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.) (Ry-R-R), rice-rice-Chinese milk vetch (Astragalus sinicus L.) (Mv-R-R) and rice-rice with winter fallow (Fa-R-R). The results showed that straw returning of winter crops significantly increased the CH4 emission during both rice growing seasons when compared with Fa-R-R. Ry-R-R plots had the largest CH4 emissions during the early rice growing season with 14.235 and 15.906 g m(-2) in 2012 and 2013, respectively, when Ry-R-R plots had the largest CH4 emission during the later rice growing season with 35.673 and 38.606 g m(-2) in 2012 and 2013, respectively. The Ry-R-R and Mv-R-R also had larger N2O emissions than Fa-R-R in both rice seasons. When compared to Fa-R-R, total N2O emissions in the early rice growing season were increased by 0.05 g m(-2) in Ry-R-R and 0.063 g m(-2) in Mv-R-R in 2012, and by 0.058 g m(-2) in Ry-R-R and 0.068 g m(-2) in Mv-R-R in 2013, respectively. Similar result were obtained in the late rice growing season, and the total N2O emissions were increased by 0.104 g m(-2) in Ry-R-R and 0.073 g m(-2) in Mv-R-R in 2012, and by 0.108 g m(-2) in Ry-R-R and 0.076 g m(-2) in Mv-R-R in 2013, respectively. The global warming potentials (GWPs) from paddy fields were ranked as Ry-R-R>Mv-R-R> Fa-R-R. As a result, straw returning of winter cover crops has significant effects on increase of CH4 and N2O emission from paddy field in double cropping rice system.

AB  - A few years ago many analysts became aware of the bioenergy production potentials of the African agricultural sector to foster economic growth and create jobs. Unleashing such potential however requires stakeholders to deal beforehand with issues related to land, biofuels, food, and environmental policies. The objective of this study is to explore the conditions under which African countries can reap the benefits of the new bioeconomy without jeopardizing food security and environmental quality. The study shows that land policies that set land rental at its marginal cost to businesses, biofuel policies that create demand through biofuels' mandate, and environmental policies that encourage best management practices must be first put in place. Subsequently, African countries must participate to the capital investment in the biofuel sector.

AB  - The goal of the project was to establish a low-tech cheap sustainable food production system that combines traditional fish farming with hydroponics (cultivating plants using mineral nutrient solutions, in water, without soil), in a symbiotic environment. We used local fish and plants species only. The project was conducted in two different stages: "construction" stage and "fish" stage. The goal of the start-up stage was to build the grow bed for the plants, to establish the water circuit, to set the lights and to prepare the fish tank for the fishes. For the "fish" stage we used local fish species (carp and caras). The goal of the stage was to build the nitrogen-fixing bacteria colonies in order to provide a constant NO3- rich water (around 50 mg/l), with as low as possible traces of NH3/NH4+ and NO2 (below 0,5 mg/l). This was established by testing the NH3/NH4+, NO2- and NO3- values under several environmental changes (pH, temperature, lighting, quantity of fish in the tank etc.) in order to identify the best combinations to achieve the goal. Upon completion of the second stage we'll test different local species of plants with the already established system. The goal of the project is to find the best combinations of fish, plants and environmental conditions in order to have a cheap, sustainable symbiotic food production system, easy to be replicated by anyone.

AB  - Amid growing environmental concerns and the imperative for sustainable agricultural practices, this study examines the potential of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria as biofertilizers, particularly in cotton cultivation. The reliance on synthetic nitrogen fertilizers (SNFs), prevalent in modern agriculture, poses significant environmental challenges, including greenhouse gas emissions and water system contamination. This research aims to shift this paradigm by exploring the capacity of cyanobacteria as a natural and sustainable alternative. Utilizing advanced metabarcoding methods to analyze the 16S rRNA gene, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of soil bacterial communities within cotton fields. This study focused on evaluating the diversity, structure, taxonomic composition, and potential functional characteristics of these communities. Emphasis was placed on the isolation of native N 2 -fixing cyanobacteria strains rom cotton soils, and their subsequent effects on cotton growth. Results from our study demonstrate significant plant growth-promoting (PGP) activities, measured as N 2 fixation, production of Phytohormones, Fe solubilization and biofertilization potential of five isolated cyanobacterial strains, underscoring their efficacy in cotton. These findings suggest a viable pathway for replacing chemical-synthetic nitrogen fertilizers with natural, organic alternatives. The reintegration of these beneficial species into agricultural ecosystems can enhance crop growth while fostering a balanced microbial environment, thus contributing to the broader goals of global sustainable agriculture.

AB  - The first inventory and zoning of the emission and sink of methane and carbon dioxide in the urban structure of greenhouse gases from soils and surface technogenic formations (STFs) (Technosols) on technogenic, recrementogenic, and natural sediments have been performed with consideration for the global warming potential under conditions of different formation rate of these gases, underflooding, and sealing. From gas geochemical criteria and anthropogenic pedogenesis features, the main sources of greenhouse gases, their intensity, and mass emission were revealed. The mass fractions of emissions from the sectors of waste and land use in the inventories of greenhouse gas emissions have been determined. New sources of gas emission have been revealed in the first sector, the emissions from which add tens of percent to the literature and state reports. In the second sector, emissions exceed the available data in 70 times. Estimation criteria based on the degree of manifestation and chemical composition of soil-geochemical anomalies and barrier capacities have been proposed. The sink of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and the internal (latent) sink of methane in soils and STFs have been determined. Ecological functions of soils and STFs have been shown, and the share of latent methane sink has been calculated. The bacterial oxidation of methane in soils and STFs exceeds its emission to the atmosphere in almost hundred times.

AB  - Farming systems need to be planned to provide suitable levels of economic profitability and, at the same time, ensure an effective energy use, in order to perform environmentally friendly production strategies. The herein present work aims to assess the efficiency of energy use and economic impacts of the main farming methods (conventional, organic and integrated) of Clementine's crops in Calabria (South Italy), through a combined use of Life Cycle Energy Assessment (LCEA) approach and economic analysis. For this purpose, data were collected from clementine producers by using face-to-face interviews. The results revealed that average energy consumption in the organic farming systems was 72,739 MJ, lower than conventional and integrated systems equal to 95,848 MJ and 94,060 MJ, respectively. This is mainly due to the ban of chemicals. Economic analysis showed that organic farms were more profitable compared with the other farming methods, because of the greater selling price and the EU economic support, reaching an average net profit of 4255 Euro ha(-1) against 3134 Euro ha(-1) of integrated farms and 2788 Euro ha(-1) of conventional ones. The economic efficiency of energy from clementine production was 0.058 Euro MJ(-1) in the organic farming, higher compared to the other two farming systems equal to 0.033 Euro MJ(-1) on average.

AB  - Three growing systems of Arabica coffee were evaluated under the energy perspective, in the state of Espirito Santo in Brazil. The systems are conventional cultivation (CC), cultivation with good agricultural practices (CGP) and organic farming (OF). It was made a comparison of the energy flows within these three systems to show sustainable levels of each one based on production average data of several family-farming units. Therefore, we analyzed crop yield, total energy efficiency reverse (TEER), energy efficiency of ripe coffee (EERC) and non-renewable energy efficiency (NREE). OF system had values for TEER, EERC and NREE of 3.3 4.7 and 7.9 respectively. Yet CC showed values of 1.8, 1.9 and 1.6 for TEER, EERC and NREE respectively. Furthermore, CGP presented values for TEER, EERC and NREE of 0.7, 1.3 and 1.4 respectively. The highest yield was observed in CGP, reaching an amount of 1794 kg ha(-1) (17,455 MJ); however, this system expends more energy than it converts. Thus, over those points, OF is the most sustainable system.

AB  - The objectives of this review are to analyse the potential of bioenergy crops development in European agriculture and to identify research objectives based on transformation technologies. Bioenergy is the chemical energy stored in organic material, which can be directly converted into useful energy sources by biological, mechanical or thermochemical processes. The substitution of food crops with energy crops and the demand for agricultural raw materials for liquid biofuel production will affect agriculture over the next decade and possibly beyond. It is expected that both second-generation biofuel production technology and energy crops used will be more efficient than first-generation. Nonetheless, there are still technical limitations for crop growth and fuel production from second-generation technology. In general, many of the crops that could supply the raw materials for second-generation biofuels are largely undomesticated and are in the first stages of development and management. The development of specific crops dedicated to energy has been proposed as a strategy to produce energy without affecting food security and the environment. The research seeks to develop enzymatic systems for the cost-efficient decomposition of cellulose into its molecular sugar components, which can then be fermented to produce ethanol. This biorefinery of crops into multiple products, including energy, chemical products and materials, will augment the overall value of the biomass. Clearly, multidisciplinary research is necessary to address sustainable biofuel production. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tea sector is a major contributor to Kenya's economy through foreign exchange via export. However, extensive amount of energy is required to produce one kilogram of tea, making tea processing energy-intensive. Comparing greenhouse gas emissions from different types of energy consumed in tea factories is imperative to enable policymakers make informed intervention in emission reduction. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions in tea factories is one of the pathways to meeting Kenya's nationally determined 32% reduction of carbon emissions by 2030 and commitment to the Paris Agreement. This paper assesses greenhouse gas emissions from different sources of energy used in four tea factories in Kenya. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emission factor is used to calculate the total emissions of each type of energy used for 5 years. Life cycle assessment using SimaPro 8 software, Eco-indicator 99 method and Eco invent database was used to assess the specific compound causing the emission. The findings reveal that the 5-year greenhouse gas emissions by biogas, solar, wood, briquettes, and electricity are 336.111, 7.108, 3057.729, and 1,338.28 kg CO2/MWh, respectively. Firewood has the highest concentration of carbon dioxide, while solar energy has the least. Analysis of variance confirms significant difference (0.05>p = 0.0272) in greenhouse gas emissions from the different energy sources. Post-hoc analyses shows a significant difference in emissions between solar and firewood (p<0.0125) and no significant difference between other sources of energy. The key environmental hotspot is the energy intensive processes such as drying involved in tea production and processing, which leads to consumption of fossil fuel in the factories. To reduce such key hotspot, switching to renewable energy sources is key. Sustainability in the tea sector can therefore be achieved through switching to macadamia briquettes as a source of thermal energy and a combination of electricity and solar for electrical energy.

AB  - The tropical climate of Malaysia presents higher environmental temperatures ranging from 27 to 31 degrees C and refrigerated semi-trailer trucks are utilized in cold chain transportation which is subjected to high thermal stresses and leads to elevated refrigeration load requirements. This subsequently causes a surge in diesel fuel consumption by the auxiliary refrigeration unit and greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. To address the issue, this research evaluates the integration of phase change material (PCM) in refrigerated vehicle walls for latent heat storage purposes, which consequently reduces refrigeration load. Reference cases without PCM and 10 different PCM cases of commercially available organic-based paraffin PCM are investigated, whereby the conventional insulation method of a refrigerated semi-trailer is modified by adding a layer of PCM within its envelope, to simulate refrigeration loads during an 8-hour vehicle operational period. The PCMs are assessed based on their physicochemical properties, and performance in energy savings, economic, and environmental benefits. Results show that daily refrigeration loads can be reduced up to 34.4 % upon PCM integration in refrigerated vehicle walls, and besides, economically, the solution is highly profitable with a benefit-cost ratio above 1. The highest performing PCMs in terms of energy savings yield short payback periods of < 3 years, which are at least 2.6 times lesser than the vehicle's lifetime, whilst providing greenhouse gas emission savings of above 2700 kgCO(2)/year. This research indeed serves as a starting point to explore the large-scale usage of PCMs in cold chain transportation in Malaysia.

AB  - Ecosystem services (ESs) provided by dryland regions are very vulnerable to environmental dynamics and management transformation, and it is still unclear how these services will be affected by the combined effects of accelerated climate variability and land-use changes at a regional macro level. In this study, the status, patterns and trends of ESs provided by the Xilingol steppe were quantitatively evaluated, and the impact of climate and land-use change on ESs were discussed. The results showed that favorable climatic conditions and the implementation of ecological policies had a substantial positive impact on regional vegetation restoration during 2000-2015. As a result of the vegetation greening, water retention and carbon sequestration increased significantly at rates of 16.01 m(3) ha(-1) and 1.75 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. Soil loss caused by wind erosion, an ecosystem disservice, decreased significantly at a rate of -0.57 t ha(-1) yr(-1). Although several environmental factors had differing impacts on the ESs changes in the subregions, including the meadow, typical and desert steppes, the main factors that contributed to the enhancement of overall ESs benefits were the climatic humidification and the reduced grazing pressure in the entire study area. The above conclusion shows that, in the era of climate change, the implementation of sustainable farming-pastoral strategies can realize a "win-win" situation between ecological restoration and socioeconomic development in arid and semi-arid steppes.

AB  - The environmental challenges in African drylands, including water scarcity, limited energy access, and food shortages, are interconnected and have significant implications for the region's sustainability and the well-being of its communities. To address these issues, comprehensive and sustainable management plans are urgently needed. This critical review delves into the water-energy-food-ecosystem (WEFE) nexus, emphasizing the importance of integrated technologies to improve water and energy efficiency while mitigating environmental impacts. Key databases were systematically reviewed, including ScienceDirect, Scopus, and ProQuest as well as various international documents, such as those accessible in the FAO Corporate Document Repository. Our emphasis was on WEFE technologies, their applications, research outcomes, and relevance in African arid regions. The study examined recent decade initiatives to bridge the research gap, emphasizing the need to consider interrelationships and broader impacts of technical solutions in water, energy, and food sectors. This analysis brought together natural and technological advancements within the WEFE nexus, yielding valuable insights. By considering significant case studies addressing WEFE challenges, we ascertained the substantial potential of WEFE nexus technologies in mitigating African dryland challenges. Additionally, the critical factors that significantly influence the adoption of these transformative technologies are identified. The outcomes of this study underscore the importance of proactively integrating innovative WEFE technologies within the natural based solutions. Closing knowledge gaps, integrating solutions, and fostering innovation are essential steps in addressing the complex challenges these regions face. These efforts lead to enhanced water, energy, and food systems, fostering regional sustainability and resilience, ultimately securing a more promising and sustainable future for vulnerable communities. This review emphasizes the potential of WEFE technologies in addressing challenges in African drylands, including water scarcity, energy access, and food shortages. It also delves into comprehensive research and approaches for enhancing community well-being and resource sustainability.

AB  - Insects as food have been consumed all over the world, mostly by ethnic communities, since time immemorial. With the ever-increasing human population causing an imbalance between food production and nutrition, edible insects are gaining importance as an alternative food source. The aim of this paper is to record the region-specific current practices of entomophagy and their implications in food security. The study involved field investigation to find out the pattern of entomophagy among the scheduled tribes of the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR), Assam. Following this, we made an effort to estimate the diversity of edible insects at different sampling sites in the studied area. Nutritional profiling of some of the edible insects was carried out to know their potential as a measure of food security. A total of 25 edible insects belonging to 9 orders and 18 families were recorded during the study period. Species diversity was recorded highest in forest/backyard forest habitat followed by agricultural field habitat, open field habitat and swampy area habitat in all the four districts in BTR, Assam. During the consumer survey, a total of 4,051 people belonging to four different scheduled tribes, Bodo, Rabha, Garo and Sarania were interviewed and out of them, 3,840 (94.79%) people were found to consume insects as food. The insects are mostly consumed in fried form, followed by smoked, raw, paste, roasted and curry form. The biochemical analysis of nutrient contents of 11 commonly consumed edible insects showed that they are a rich source of protein, vitamins and micronutrients with a reasonable amount of carbohydrates and lipids with higher radical scavenging activity. To manage insects in the context of food security, increased attention should be given to sustainable collection and successful farming of edible insects for the creation of export potential, giving emphasis on the nutritional advantages.

AB  - In the context of increasing attention towards sustainable and high quality food products, Italy plays a key role in Europe due to its embedded territorial vocation for locally produced food and alternative agriculture systems helping biodiversity and landscape preservation. Here, we report an overview of Italian agriculture by analysing organic farming (OF) and geographical indication (GI) systems and their contribution to the national agriculture. Land use data highlight that OF and GI contribute around 10% to the utilised agriculture area (UAA), with relevant distinctions in terms of regional distribution. While GIs are mostly in the north-central regions (8.5%), OF products are most frequent in the south and on the islands (5.0% of UAA). This trend was observed on the one hand ins Trentino-South Tirol, Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia (%UAA GI/%UAA OF>5.9), and on the other in Calabria, Basilicata and Sicily (%UAA GI/%UAA OF<0.1). Similarly, both systems are W id e spread in less-favoured areas in terms of agricultural intensification, providing support to preserve agro-systems and reduce land abandonment.

AB  - Agriculture across the globe needs to produce "more with less." Productivity should be increased in a sustainable manner so that the environment is not further degraded, management practices are both socially acceptable and economically favorable, and future generations are not disadvantaged. The objective of this paper was to compare the environmental efficiency of 2 divergent strains of Holstein-Friesian cows across 2 contrasting dairy management systems (grazing and non-grazing) over multiple years and so expose any genetic x environment (G x E) interaction. The models were an extension of the traditional efficiency analysis to account for undesirable outputs (pollutants), and estimate efficiency measures that allow for the asymmetric treatment of desirable outputs (i.e., milk production) and undesirable outputs. Two types of models were estimated, one considering production inputs (land, nitrogen fertilizers, feed, and cows) and the other not, thus allowing the assessment of the effect of inputs by comparing efficiency values and rankings between models. Each model type had 2 versions, one including 2 types of pollutants (greenhouse gas emissions, nitrogen surplus) and the other 3 (greenhouse gas emissions, nitrogen surplus, and phosphorus surplus). Significant differences were found between efficiency scores among the systems. Results indicated no G x E interaction; however, even though the select genetic merit herd consuming a diet with a higher proportion of concentrated feeds was most efficient in the majority of models, cows of the same genetic merit on higher forage diets could be just as efficient. Efficiency scores for the low forage groups were less variable from year to year, which reflected the uniformity of purchased concentrate feeds. The results also indicate that inputs play an important role in the measurement of environmental efficiency of dairy systems and that animal health variables (incidence of udder health disorders and body condition score) have a significant effect on the environmental efficiency of each dairy system. We conclude that traditional narrow measures of performance may not always distinguish dairy farming systems best fitted to future requirements.

AB  - Livestock activity is one of the most contributors to climate-change emissions in the agriculture sector. European environmental policies face with the challenge of increasing farmers economic gain not conflicting with environmental aim at the same time, to meet targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). The paper aims to contribute to the discussion on CO2 emission mitigation by providing efficiency performance measures in the presence of joint production of milk and GHG emissions. A Slacks-Based Measure-Data Envelopment Analysis (SBM-DEA) with undesirable output was adopted and integrated with Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) results from 10 dairy cattle farms in Umbria (Italy) to estimate their environmental efficiency and emission reduction potential. In addition, the dual model of the SBM-DEA was used to quantify the marginal CO2 reduction costs. Four farms resulted in no CO2-eq emission efficient, with a reduction potential ranging from 45.7% to 26.3% of CO2-eq. An average abatement cost of (sic) 243.08 in terms of lower milk production per ton of CO2-eq reduced, was estimated for the whole sample. A positive relationship between marginal abatement costs and CO2-eq efficiency scores was estimated. Marginal abatement costs knowledge could allow assessing the economic impacts of different farms strategies aimed at reducing polluting emissions, as well as the introduction of incentive mechanisms by public decision makers.

AB  - The environmental factors controlling soil biodiversity along resource gradients remain poorly understood in wet tropical ecosystems. Aboveground biodiversity is expected to be driven by changes in nutrient availability in these ecosystems, however, much less is known about the importance of nutrient availability in driving soil biodiversity. Here, we combined a cross-continental soil survey across tropical regions with a three decades' field experiment adding nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) (100 kg N ha(-1)y(-1) and 100 kg P ha(-1)y(-1)) to Hawai'ian tropical forests with contrasting substrate ages (300 and 4,100,000 years) to investigate the influence of nutrient availability to explain the biodiversity of soil bacteria, fungi, protists, invertebrates and key functional genes. We found that soil biodiversity was driven by soil acidification during long-term pedogenesis and across environmental gradients, rather than by nutrient limitations. In fact, our results showed that experimental N additions caused substantial acidification in soils from Hawai'i. These declines in pH were related to large decreases in soil biodiversity from tropical ecosystems in four continents. Moreover, the microbial activity did not change in response to long-term N and P additions. We concluded that environmental filtering drives the biodiversity of multiple soil organisms, and that the acidification effects associated with N additions can further create substantial undesired net negative effects on overall soil biodiversity in naturally tropical acid soils. This knowledge is integral for the understanding and management of soil biodiversity in tropical ecosystems globally.

The assessment was conducted based on agro-ecological indicators and environmental burden (material pressure). The analysis was conducted according to a classification into agricultural holding types: field crops, dairy cattle, and mixed holdings. The factor with the strongest impact on the agro-ecological sustainability of the studied agricultural holdings was the holding type. Field crop and mixed holdings achieved more favorable environmental sustainability indicators. Holdings specializing in dairy cattle breeding pose a threat to the natural environment due to their excessive number of livestock.

AB  - Foodservice is a key contributor to environmental impacts of the healthcare sector, in particular hospitals. Driving towards sustainable solutions in foodservices can bring financial and social benefits, whilst allowing hospitals to position themselves as leaders towards a sustainable food system and healthcare sector. Such a change depends on those working directly or indirectly with foodservices. Staff possess valuable knowledge, ideas, motivation and responsibility for improving the environmental sustainability of the foodservice system. The aim of this study was to explore the perspectives of staff working across the hospital food supply chain towards: (1) sustainable practices in hospital food provision; (2) existing barriers and enablers; and (3) recommendations for implementing sustainable foodservice practices in the future. Through qualitative inquiry, semi-structured interviews were conducted with individuals at operational and management levels responsible for policy, purchasing, production, onsite plating and delivery and waste disposal at three hospitals in Australia. Framework analysis was used to synthesise transcribed data into practices, barriers and enablers, and recommendations. Interviews (n=46 participants) identified current sustainable practices including those related to recyclable packaging, effective equipment and technology and efficient processes. Unsustainable practices included restrictions on sourcing food, packaging that cannot be separated or recycled, rigid foodservice models and menu, waste production and processes. Enablers to improve sustainability included the power of individuals to influence change, education on recycling, knowledge generation, audits and grants for innovative research, rebates and quality improvement processes. Barriers included competing priorities, poor communication, lack of training opportunities and knowledge, infection control restrictions, lack of policy, funding, and time between meal ordering and delivery. Participants proposed practice changes across the food supply chain and recommended generation and sharing of knowledge, leadership and policy support. Perspectives of individuals within foodservice reveal shared motivation and desire for sustainable foodservices, with support needed from leaders and policy. Future research should use a co-design approach involving staff to create and implement sustainable strategies within hospitals. To see widespread and timely change, action is needed towards effective and meaningful policy. (C) 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biorefineries are expected to play a major role in a future low carbon economy and substantial investments are being made to support this vision. However, it is important to consider the wider socio-economic impacts of such a transition. This paper quantifies the potential trade, employment and land impacts of economically viable European biorefinery options based on indigenous straw and wood feedstocks. It illustrates how there could be potential for 70-80 European biorefineries, but not hundreds. A single facility could generate tens of thousands of man-years of employment and employment creation per unit of feedstock is higher than for biomass power plants. However, contribution to national GDP is unlikely to exceed 1% in European member states, although contributions to national agricultural productivity may be more significant, particularly with straw feedstocks. There is also a risk that biorefinery development could result in reduced rates of straw incorporation into soil, raising concerns that economically rational decisions to sell rather than reincorporate straw could result in increased agricultural land-use or greenhouse gas emissions.

AB  - This study investigates how exposure to short and long-term measures of rainfall shocks and past crop diversification decisions influence subsequent diversification in Malawi and Tanzania. We use balanced household panel data combined with corresponding historical monthly weather data to achieve our aim. Crop diversification is studied as a state-contingent risky investment decision that households make before the state of nature is revealed. We model crop diversification decisions using correlated and dynamic random effects panel Poisson and Tobit models that control for unobserved heterogeneity in household crop diversification decisions plus initial conditions that may influence crop diversification across space and time. We establish that smallholder farmers in Malawi and Tanzania respond to rainfall shocks by diversifying their crop portfolios and that crop diversification decisions are state-dependent. Thus, farmers with knowledge and experience gained from past crop diversification have elevated chances to intensify subsequent crop diversification and adapt to recurrent rainfall shocks. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the relatively better-off farmers with sufficient land and non land household assets to a greater extent diversify the crop portfolio post-drought shock exposure. Pro-poor policies addressing seed access constraints are needed to support diversification and adaptation to shocks.

AB  - Soil salt accumulation and salt leaching are very important issues for a long-term irrigation-dominated oasis with shallow groundwater in arid land. The critical ratio of drainage to irrigation (CRDI) was defined and determined to help the guide drainage and irrigation practices and maintain sustainable oasis agricultural development. This study aimed to identify the soil salinity evolution under long-term irrigation and to determine the threshold of irrigation to drainage with land-use change and groundwater depth by regression, water and salt balance, and geostatistical analysis. The results showed that the soil salinity in 0-20 cm soil depth has decreased greatly in the Weigan Oasis over the past 60 years, with an annual average decrease of 0.68 g.kg(-1) in the Weigan Oasis. The soil salt content generally increases from inside to outside of the region and varies from the upperstream to downstream. In the past 30 years, land-use change has caused a sharp reduction in the salinity in the region, and the process of irrigation and drainage has made a decrease in the total salt of the irrigated district of 207.38 x 10(5) t. Meanwhile, shallow groundwater depth and salinity are the main factors influencing soil salinization in this fluvial oasis. A CRDI is determined to be 8.20% in the Weigan Oasis. In conclusion, our study provides scientific support for the prevention and control of regional soil salinization, as well as a managerial basis for the rational allocation of water resources in long-term irrigation-dominated oasis.

AB  - Climate change affects crop production by distorting the indestructible productive power of the land. The objective of this study is to examine the economic impacts of climate change on net crop income in Nile Basin Ethiopia using a Ricardian fixed effect approach employing the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) household survey data for Ethiopia in 2015 and 2016. The survey samples were obtained through a three-stage stratified sampling technique from the five regions (Amhara, Tigray, Benishangul Gumuz, Oromia, and Southern Nation Nationality and People (SNNP) along the Nile basin Ethiopia. There are only 12-14% female household heads while there are 80-86% male households in the regions under study. In the regions, more than half of (64%) the household heads are illiterate and almost only one-tenth of them (12%) had received remittance from abroad from their relatives or children. Crop variety adoption rate is minimal, adopted by the 31% of farmers. Only 30% of the surveyed farmers mentioned that they planted their crop seeds in row whereas the rest 70% had not applied this method. The regression results from the fixed effect least square dummy variable model showed that literacy, household size, remittance, asset value, and total land holdings have significant and positive impacts on the net crop income per hectare. The regional dummy variables estimate indicated that all the regions are negatively affected by climate change at varying levels. Strategies to climate change adaptation have significant and positive contributions in leveraging the damaging effects of climate change. The results also showed that increased winter and summer temperature and rainfall increase net crop income per hectare. The estimated coefficient of the interaction term of spring temperature and rainfall is significant and negative. On the other hand, while the mean annual temperature is damaging to crops, annual rainfall is beneficial. It can be deduced that, while increased temperature and rainfall in summer and winter increase the net crop income, the converse is true for winter and spring seasons. The study also proposes a specific, context-dependent, farm-level adaptation analysis of how farmers cope with the different climatic impacts of the Nile Basin and maintain the income levels that they have previously enjoyed.

AB  - Aquatic foods, including fish, are a substantial component of animal source foods globally, and make a critical nutritional contribution to diets in many contexts. In the global North, concern among consumers and regulators over the safety and environmental sustainability of seafood, particularly in developed nations, has led to the development of increasingly stringent seafood safety standards. While such standards may constitute regularity, logistical, and economic barriers to participation in export markets by small-scale producers, they have in other contexts catalysed upgrades to production and post-harvest handling practices within value chains associated with both capture fisheries and aquaculture. The health burden of foodborne illnesses is a major concern in developing countries. As incomes rise, consumers in developing countries are increasingly willing to pay a premium for safer and environmentally sustainable foods. However, there is little empirical evidence on consumers' willingness to pay for seafood safety in developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Data on demand for seafood safety and environmental sustainability certification in African countries are largely unavailable in the public domain. In this paper, we describe data collected in Lagos State, Nigeria in October and November 2019. Experiments in the form of Becker-DeGroote-Marschak (BDM) auction mechanism, and post experiment surveys were conducted with 200 fish consumers in fish markets. These data can be used to assess whether consumers' demand for safe and healthy seafood from local markets can be harnessed to generate positive economic returns to producers. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - CONTEXT: Agriculture plays a vital role in African countries, driving economic growth, employment, and nonagricultural sector improvements. However, persistent food insecurity and poverty among smallholder families raise concerns. Land fragmentation compounds these issues, limiting agricultural productivity and pushing farmers towards off -farm activities, despite Africa's potential agricultural markets. OBJECTIVE: The study's focus is Donomade<acute accent>, a remote village in southern Togo. This study pursues a dual objective. Firstly, it investigates how household characteristics, including family size and resource availability, influence farmers' resource management decisions. Secondly, the research employs serious games to comprehend farmers' livelihood strategy choices within constrained real -world -like conditions. METHODS: The iterative and participatory Companion Modelling (ComMod) approach was utilized for the codesign and co -development of a serious game. This involved close collaboration with a local research team from the University of Lome<acute accent>, a local NGO, and Donomade<acute accent> village farmers. Various farming systems were characterized, and collective insights into Donomade<acute accent>'s agricultural dynamics were gathered through surveys, interviews, and workshops. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of their in -game roles, farmers prioritize fulfilling basic family needs, such as food security and education instead of investing in agriculture. The study underscores the significance of household composition and resource availability when designing technology interventions or support mechanisms for farmers. Aligning interventions with farmers' overarching goals and challenges can enhance technology adoption. Furthermore, addressing food security remains crucial for sustainable development, as it not only improves human welfare and alleviates hunger but also forms the foundation for comprehensive solutions in the face of climate change, resource constraints, and population growth. SIGNIFICANCE: This research highlights that heavy investment in agriculture is not the priority for many farmers in southern Togo, despite it being their main source of sustenance and income. Addressing immediate family needs, especially food security, education, and housing, takes precedence over long-term agricultural investments. Given the persistent challenge of food security amidst global uncertainties, addressing these priorities is paramount to stimulate more significant interest in agricultural investment.

AB  - Introduction The struggle against climate change in agriculture requires an increased understanding of greenhouse gas emissions, mainly from cattle farming. Through precise and accessible methods to monitor the methane (CH4) emissions of these animals, it is possible to assess the influence of several factors.Therefore, this study evaluates CH4 emissions from Catrina cattle, an autochthonous breed from the Azores, and Holstein-Friesian cattle, aiming to assess the potential environmental impact and sustainability of this native breed. Materials and methods The present study was performed on a total of 15 dry cows, seven Catrina and eight Holstein-Friesian, housed by breed, in groups of five animals. The laser methane detector was used to assess the repeatability and reproducibility of CH4 values, including peaks and respiration. Descriptive statistics for raw data, CH4 breath and peaks, and the amount of CH4 emitted per day and year were calculated. Results From the Catrina breed, the average of CH4 emissions were 37.04 +/- 40.09 ppm x m for raw data, 33.15 +/- 28.59 ppm x m for CH4 breath, and 218.65 +/- 67.13 ppm x m for CH4 peaks. From the Holstein-Friesian, the values obtained were 65.62 +/- 87.11 ppm x m, 57.57 +/- 52.59 ppm x m, and 514.19 +/- 266.02 ppm x m, respectively. Linear mixed models, the Chisquare method and ANOVA, which showed a significant breed effect (p < 0.001) across all datasets, with trends favoring higher emissions in Holstein-Friesian were also applied. Similarly, Pearson correlation analyses yielded consistent trends, however, with no statistical significance (p > 0.05). Discussion and conclusion The findings underscore the importance of preserving cultural and genetic heritage while addressing climate change and environmental challenges. Furthermore, the study highlights the adaptive capacity of autochthonous breeds to their local environments, suggesting their role in sustainable systems. However, methane emissions will be influenced by several factors, besides breed variable, so this study emphasizes the need to integrate the assessment of the microbiome, which depends on the composition of the diet, genetic characteristics, and other aspects, for the development of methane mitigation strategies, with the inclusion of native breeds in sustainable resource management and climate adaptation efforts.

AB  - Given the relevance of producer cooperatives in policy debates around rural development, agricultural sustainability and inclusive business, there is surprisingly little information on whether these cooperatives are inclusive of smallholders. This paper reviews conceptual discussions and empirical evidence on the notion of a producer cooperative as an inclusive business. Three organisational characteristics may affect the inclusiveness of producer cooperatives: community-orientation versus market-orientation; open versus closed membership; who is represented in the governance of the cooperative. When cooperatives evolve from community-orientation towards market-orientation, they are likely to become less inclusive.

AB  - It is of paramount importance to have sustainable agriculture since agriculture is the backbone of many nations' economic development. Majority of agricultural professionals rarely capture the cropping patterns necessary to promote Good Agricultural Practises. Objective of this research is to explore the potential of mapping cropping patterns occurring on different field parcels on small-scale farmlands in Zimbabwe. The first study location under investigation are the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) research station and a few neighboring fields, the second is Middle Sabi Estate. Fourier time series modeling was implemented to determine the trends befalling on the two study sites. Results reveal that Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time series allow detection of subtle changes that occur to the crops and fields respectively, hence can be utilized to detect cropping patterns on small-scale farmlands. Discrimination of the main crops (maize and soybean) grown at CIMMYT was possible, and crop rotation was synthesized where sowing starts in November. A single cropping of early and late crops was observed, there were no winter crops planted during the investigation period. At Middle Sabi Estate, single cropping on perennial sugarcane fields and triple cropping of fields growing leafy vegetables, tomatoes and onions were observed. Classification of stacked images was used to derive the crop rotation maps representing what is practised at the farming lands. Random forest classification of the multi-temporal image stacks achieved overall accuracies of 99% and 95% on the respective study sites. In conclusion, Sentinel-1 time series can be implemented effectively to map the cropping patterns and crop rotations occurring on small-scale farming land. We recommend the use of Sentinel-1 SAR multi-temporal data to spatially explicitly map cropping patterns of single-, double- and triple-cropping systems on both small-scale and large-scale farming areas to ensure food security.

AB  - The increased number of development cooperation and sustainable agriculture partnerships brings with it new challenges for professionals who are asked to facilitate these partnering processes. In this article we shed more light on the world of development cooperation and we explore questions that facilitators working with North - South partnerships face. The main research questions are: What are the distinguishing characteristics of North - South partnership dynamics; what insights and lessons can we draw from the management of these partnerships, and what recommendations or advice can we offer to those facilitating such partnerships? On the basis of a deductive research process we reveal a number of characteristics that mark the process of building partnerships within the context of development cooperation. Through two cases of sustainable agriculture partnerships-biological cotton and responsible soy-we discuss how professionals confront these specific characteristics and how they address these. The material from the two cases was made more complete by drawing on other experiences and relevant literature. The revealed characteristics creating challenges for professionals facilitating partnerships are the following: ideology and values; politically loaded relationships; unilateral financial dependence; cultural and physical distance; and fragile social trust. We end with some essential operational guidelines for professionals managing or advising partnerships. As partnerships in development cooperation are becoming ever more important, there is a need for more professionalization. However, few studies have paid attention to the challenges professionals face and the way they can deal with them.

AB  - We examined the occurrence of Dactylorhiza majalis, the most abundant terrestrial orchid species growing in rapidly disappearing wet meadows, at 50 historical sites for 3 years. We aimed to find the most frequent reasons for its recent extinction at many sites. We found that the main reasons for its extinction were absence of mowing, intensive fertilisation and washouts of fertilisers from fields nearby. At extant sites, we studied its biometric characteristics and composition of surrounding vegetation, to determine factors affecting its persistence. Bad performance of persisting populations of this species was associated with prevalence of grasses, low May temperatures and absence of mowing. This confirms, at metapopulation level, what has previously been observed at the level of individual populations. We suggest that the system of agricultural subsidies in the country should change towards more sensitive allocation of funds to those farmers, who will adopt the appropriate management of wet meadows and their surroundings.

AB  - Increasing pressure for food security and sustainability as well as a need to halt environmental degradation has focused attention on increasing the efficient use of farm resources. One answer to aspects of that problem is the use of precision agricultural technologies (PATs). To facilitate their adoption, initiatives have been fostered in developed countries since the 1980s. Despite a low rate of adoption elsewhere, similar efforts in recent years have been initiated in developing countries. Given this, understanding those underlying factors that influence the adoption of PATs is vital. It is timely to review these factors and to draw policy implications from that review for future actions. This review, based on studies investigating the limited adoption of PATs in 'experienced' countries, extrapolates their findings to explain why farmers have or have not adopted PATs. At the same time, this review summarizes the key insights for more effectively targeting 'new' followers: e.g. it provides some answers to the question of who is more likely to adopt PATs. Additionally, the review points to the limitations of current research in the area and suggests a robust economic model or multidisciplinary approach be adopted for future investigation.

AB  - Adoption of climate-smart agriculture practices are believed to have significantly lessened the devastating impact of climate change on agriculture. However, in countries like Ethiopia, the adoption and use level of climate-smart agriculture practices remains low. The understanding of farmers' levels of CSA practice adoption and influencing factors is therefore crucial. The goal of the study is to evaluate the degree to which various CSA practices were being used in the study area, as well as adoption determinants. The study was conducted in Welmera district, Oromia, Ethiopia. Three kebeles were chosen from the district, and a random sample of 306 farmers was picked. We used a cross-sectional household survey, a focus group discussion, and interviews with key informants. A multivariate probit model was employed to investigate the factors influencing the adoption of multiple climate-smart agriculture practices. According to the result, conservation agriculture, integrated soil fertility management, and crop diversification are the most often used CSA practices. The results also revealed that male farmers outperformed female farmers in terms of crop diversity and improved animal feed and feeding practice adoption. The age of farmers has a considerable and unfavorable impact on their likelihood of adopting improved soil fertility management and crop diversification practices. However, it has a positive and considerable impact on the adoption of agroforestry practices. With regards to economic factors, having a relatively big farmland area considerably enhances the adoption of conservation agriculture, enhances soil fertility management and crop diversity, and improves livestock feed and feeding methods and post-harvest technology practice. Improved livestock feed and feeding are more likely to be used with higher farm income. Having a significant number of animals strongly promotes the adoption of conservation agriculture, and access to financial services positively impacts agroforestry, diversification of crops, and postharvest technology practice adoption. Furthermore, institutional factors including access to agricultural extension services and training were discovered to be important and beneficial for crop diversification; similarly, access to field day participation was discovered to have a significant and positive impact on the adoption of conservation agriculture and improved soil fertility management practices. It is critical to raise awareness about climate change among farmers and experts, as well as to incorporate location-specific CSA practices into agricultural programs.

AB  - Adopting conservation tillage technology can promote sustainable agriculture development. There have been many studies on all farmers' conservation tillage behaviors, but few studies are based on a farmer's multidimensional heterogeneity perspective. Given the background, we conduct an empirical evaluation using micro survey data from 819 households in the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River Basin. This paper uses the entropy method to classify farm households into three types: economically dominant, resource dominant, and socially dominant. Furthermore, we use the Heckman sample selection model to discuss the factors that affect the adoption of conservation tillage technology by different types of farmers. The results show that land fragmentation degree can inhibit economically dominant farmers conservation tillage technology adoption behavior. Social relations can positively influence resource dominant farmers. The share of non-farm income will positively impact socially dominant farmers. This paper further proposes policy implications, based on the findings that different types of farmers have various factors influencing conservation tillage technology adoption behavior.

AB  - Agricultural systems face increasing challenges due to climate change, necessitating effective adaptation and mitigation strategies. This study investigates smallholder farmers' perceptions of the efficacy of these strategies in The Gambia, employing a mixed-method approach that includes a perception index (PI), effectiveness score (ES), importance-performance analysis (IPA), and statistical analysis. A structured survey was conducted among 420 smallholder farmers across three agricultural regions. Farmers rated adaptation and mitigation strategies using a Likert scale, and a PI was developed to quantify their responses. The index was 0.66, indicating a moderate level of perceived effectiveness. Additionally, ES was calculated to assess the performance of various strategies, while IPA categorized strategies based on their adoption and perceived impact. Chi-square tests and factor analysis were applied to explore differences in perceptions. The findings reveal that strategies such as crop diversification, pesticide application, irrigation, and the use of inorganic fertilizers are widely adopted and perceived as effective. The IPA matrix identified key strategies needing improvement, particularly those with high importance but low performance. Barriers to adoption include limited financial resources (77%), lack of government support (64%), and insufficient knowledge (52%), with no significant gender-based differences in perceptions. This study underscores the need for policy interventions that integrate farmers' perceptions to enhance climate resilience. Targeted investments in adaptive technologies, financial support, and knowledge-sharing platforms can improve adoption and effectiveness. This research provides valuable insights into the interplay between farmer perceptions, adaptation strategies, and agricultural sustainability in The Gambia.

AB  - Objective: Education is a crucial social determinant of health. Food insecurity can be detrimental to children's academic achievement, potentially perpetuating a cycle of poverty and food insecurity. We aimed to assess the relationship between food insecurity and academic achievement in Canadian school-aged children. Design: Cross-sectional study of children and parents. Parents completed the short-form Household Food Security Survey Module and questions about income and education level (socio-economic status). Children completed FFQ. Data were prospectively linked to children's performance on standardized exams written one year later. Mixed-effect logistic regression was employed to assess the relationship between food insecurity and likelihood of meeting academic expectations adjusting for socio-economic status, diet quality and potential confounders. Setting: Nova Scotia, Canada in 2011-2012. Subjects: Students (n 4105) in grade 5 (10-11 years; 2167 girls) and their parents. Results: Low food security was reported by 9.8 % of households; very low food security by 7.1 % of households. Students from low-income households and reporting poor diet quality were less likely to do well in school. Children who lived in households reporting very low food security had 0.65 times the odds (OR=0.65; 95 % CI 0.44, 0.96) of meeting expectations for reading and 0.62 times the odds (OR=0.62; 95 % CI 0.45, 0.86) of meeting expectations for mathematics. Conclusions: Very low household insecurity is associated with poor academic achievement among children in Nova Scotia.

AB  - Forests strongly affect climate through the exchange of large amounts of atmospheric CO2 (ref. 1). The main drivers of spatial variability in net ecosystem production (NEP) on a global scale are, however, poorly known. As increasing nutrient availability increases the production of biomass per unit of photosynthesis(2) and reduces heterotrophic(3) respiration in forests, we expected nutrients to determine carbon sequestration in forests. Our synthesis study of 92 forests in different climate zones revealed that nutrient availability indeed plays a crucial role in determining NEP and ecosystem carbon-use efficiency (CUEe; that is, the ratio of NEP to gross primary production (GPP)). Forests with high GPP exhibited high NEP only in nutrient-rich forests (CUEe = 33 +/- 4%; mean +/- s.e.m.). In nutrient-poor forests, a much larger proportion of GPP was released through ecosystem respiration, resulting in lower CUEe (6 +/- 4%). Our finding that nutrient availability exerts a stronger control on NEP than on carbon input (GPP) conflicts with assumptions of nearly all global coupled carbon cycle-climate models, which assume that carbon inputs through photosynthesis drive biomass production and carbon sequestration. An improved global understanding of nutrient availability would therefore greatly improve carbon cycle modelling and should become a critical focus for future research.

AB  - Atmospheric chemistry depends on nitrogen compounds: NO and NO2 are tropospheric ozone precursors, N2O is a greenhouse gas. A significant source for these compounds is the use of nitrogen fertilizer in agriculture. Emissions of NH3, NO and N2O were measured on irrigated maize fields, after fertilization with urea or under pressure anhydrous ammonia, in the Landes de Gascogne. Nitrous oxide emissions were also observed in winter. The imbalance of the nitrogen budget might be explained by gaseous losses, water-table pollution remaining low. This is a specificity of this agrosystem.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assess and explain the trust situation in EU agri-food supply chains in the context of the assumption that the existence of well-functioning trust-based supplier-buyer relationships enables a secure and safe food supply. Design/methodology/approach - Using structural equation modelling (SEM) and survey data (n = 1,430) on supplier-buyer relationships from six different countries, two commodity supply chains (meat and cereals) and two supply chain stages (farmer-processor and processor-retailer), main trust determinants are identified and discussed. By simultaneously covering two supply chain stages the analysis adopts a perspective beyond the dyad. Findings - The SEM results indicate that trust in supply chain partners can be significantly improved by effective communication and by positive past collaboration. The existence of personal bonds (ties) between partners does not seem to play a direct role in the retailer-processor relationship but is important when dealing with farmers. In both supply chain stages positive past collaboration as well as the existence of personal bonds also indirectly enhance trust by promoting effective communication which in turn positively impacts on trust levels, thus proofing communication to be a powerful mediator variable. Practical implications - This study's findings can be used by practitioners to learn how to improve trust in their supply chain relationships and how to communicate effectively. Originality/value - The results provide large-scale empirical evidence on trust drivers in European agri-food supply chains thus confirming earlier studies on the topic from other industries.

AB  - This paper presents a case study in which the effects of agri-envirorimental policy on two Mediterranean-type farming systems, grazing dominant and cropping dominant, are contrasted. Two greenhouse gas abatement policies are examined; an emissions taxation policy and an emissions restrictions policy. The study seeks to determine firstly, how the policy impacts on the farming systems, and from that, how the nature of the farming systems impact on the effectiveness of the policy. It is shown that relative costs of abatement are higher for the grazing-dominant farming system. However, in the absence of technological change to aid abatement, the cost of substitution from high emitting enterprises, such as livestock, to low emitting enterprises, such as crop production, will determine the cost of abatement. For both farming systems the restriction policy is found to be more effective and economically efficient than the taxation policy. The analysis found that crediting trees as carbon sinks can significantly reduce the costs of abatement. At predicted emissions permit prices, trees would be adopted by both farming systems to offset farm greenhouse gas emissions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - On 4 June 2017, Qatar was suddenly put under an embargo by its regional neighbors - an effort spearheaded by Saudi Arabia and the UAE, who cut off most of its existing land, sea, and air traffic routes. With no domestic agriculture to speak of, Qatar's external logistics networks are essential for maintaining its food supply. The country's 2.6 million residents, many of whom flooded the grocery stores, were understandably concerned about their ability to secure food when news about the embargo broke. Eventually, new food supply chains were established, primarily with the assistance of partners in Iran and Turkey. The ongoing rift between Qatar and its neighbors in the Arabian Peninsula, manifested only in part by this effort to undermine the country's material supply networks raises a number of questions about an old idea: that of food as a 'weapon'. This article puts this concept in historical and regional perspective in the Arabian Peninsula through the lens of critical geopolitics, tracing the securitizing discourses about food security and their intertwining with narratives about territorial sovereignty, nationalism, and essentialist understandings of geography to explain the causes and effects of the food embargo in the ongoing Qatar-Gulf rift.

AB  - Purpose Global lockdowns and restrictions linked to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have affected food environments and consumption patterns. Conflict-affected countries are disproportionately affected from economic and food security perspectives. In this regard, the Palestinian territories (namely West Bank and Gaza Strip), which face a number of issues such as Israeli military and economic control, overcrowded cities and refugee camps (especially in Gaza Strip), rising poverty and food insecurity, are an especially interesting case study. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to analyze the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on the selection and intake of foods and drinks, as well as consumer behavior and attitude toward food in the Palestinian territories. Design/methodology/approach The paper draws upon an online survey in the Palestinian territories administered in Arabic through the Survey Monkey platform from September 15 to October 10, 2020, with 322 adults. The survey findings were analyzed using descriptive statistics and several nonparametric tests. Particularly, the U-Mann Whitney test was used in dichotomous, categorical independent variables (e.g. gender), while the Kruskal-Wallis test was run to analyze multi-choice responses (e.g. occupation). Findings The results reveal that food attitudes and consumer behavior towards food have been widely affected. First, they reveal that Palestinians try to have healthier diets but ate more between meals (e.g. snacks). Second, the pandemic transformed respondents' shopping behavior and induced panic buying, negatively affecting food affordability due to increased prices of some foods (e.g. fruits and vegetables). Some food behaviors were shaped by negative psychological determinants (e.g. depression and anxiety). The pandemic effects are moderated by different sociodemographics (age, education and income). COVID-19 negatively affected food security but also opened a "window of opportunity" to trigger the transition towards more sustainable diets. Originality/value The paper results show that the eventual effects of COVID-19 will most likely vary from country to country, based not only on the epidemiological circumstances but also, among other factors, on the baseline socioeconomic situation and shock resilience. The findings contribute to the clarification and critical analysis of the impacts of COVID-19 on food behaviors in the Palestinian territories, which would have several policy implications.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Traditional food markets are essential in urban food environments in Kenya and other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). They provide affordable fresh food, particularly for low-income urban communities, and are vital places of livelihoods and local economic activities. Despite their importance, associations between market-related factors and diet quality for vendors and consumers are underexplored. This study explores these relationships to inform policies aimed at improving diets and nutrition in LMICs. Methods: Survey data were collected from 1042 vendors and 876 consumers in five urban markets in Kenya. The survey assessed market-related factors, consumer purchasing behavior, socioeconomic factors, and dietary outcomes using the Kenya Diet Quality Questionnaire. Linear regression models were employed to evaluate associations between the availability of foods, consumers' purchase of foods, proximity to the market, reported sickness from food, and diet quality indicators, including the Dietary Diversity Score (DDS), Global Dietary Recommendations (GDRs), NCD-Protect, and NCD-Risk scores. Results: Vendors' own dietary outcomes were characterized by lower DDS, NCD-Protect, and NCD-Risk scores but higher GDR scores compared to consumers. Significant associations were identified between the purchase of specific food groups (e.g., vegetables, legumes, and nuts) and improved diet quality for consumers. Longer travel times were linked to lower diet quality for both vendors and consumers. Socioeconomic factors, such as gender, age, and education, significantly influenced diet quality. Conclusions: Traditional markets play a pivotal role in urban food environments. Policies that enhance market access and support vendors and consumers, particularly women, young adults, and low-income groups, are essential to improving diets and nutrition outcomes in LMICs.

AB  - The study of food systems is a quickly growing field. In high demand by postsecondary students, new food systems studies programs are emerging from a range of disciplines. Food systems are inherently complex and are best understood from a range of academic perspectives and practical contexts. We review current scholarship on food systems pedagogy and present approaches for developing and implementing food systems curricula. A literature review and our experience indicate that effective food systems program approaches include emphasizing interdisciplinarity and a systems approach and balancing experience, theory, and practical skills acquisition. We discuss strategies, challenges and opportunities for building food systems curricula.

AB  - African American (AA) individuals experience food insecurity at twice the rate of the general population. However, few patients are screened for these measures in the oncology setting. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate associations between food insecurity and dietary quality in AA patients with gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies. The secondary aim was to evaluate differences in dietary quality and the level of food insecurity between the participants at Temple University Hospital (TUH) vs. Fox Chase Cancer Center (FCCC). A single-arm, cross-sectional study was conducted, in which 40 AA patients with GI malignancies were recruited at FCCC and TUH between February 2021 and July 2021. Participants completed the US Adult Food Security Survey Module to assess the level of food security (food secure vs. food insecure). An electronic food frequency questionnaire (VioScreen (TM)) was administered to obtain usual dietary intake. Diet quality was calculated using the Healthy Eating Index 2015 (HEI-2015). Dietary quality and food insecurity were summarized using standard statistical measures. Overall, 6 of the 40 participants (15%) reported food insecurity, and the mean HEI-2015 score was 64.2. No association was observed between dietary quality and food insecurity (p = 0.29). However, we noted that dietary quality was significantly lower among patients presenting at TUH (mean HEI-2015 = 57.8) compared to patients at FCCC (mean HEI-2015 = 73.5) (p < 0.01). Food insecurity scores were also significantly higher in the TUH population vs. the FCCC population (p < 0.01).

AB  - Objective: To assess associations between household food security status and indicators of food skills, health literacy and home meal preparation, among young Canadian adults. Design: Cross-sectional data were analysed using logistic regression and general linear models to assess associations between food security status and food skills, health literacy and the proportion of meals prepared at home, by gender. Setting: Participants recruited from five Canadian cities (Vancouver (BC), Edmonton (AB), Toronto (ON), Montreal (QB) and Halifax (NS)) completed an online survey. Participants: 1389 men and 1340 women aged 16-30 years. Results: Self-reported food skills were not associated with food security status (P > 0 center dot 05) among men or women. Compared to those with high health literacy (based on interpretation of a nutrition label), higher odds of food insecurity were observed among men (adjusted OR (AOR): 2 center dot 58, 95 % CI 1 center dot 74, 3 center dot 82 and 1 center dot 56, 95 % CI 1 center dot 07, 2 center dot 28) and women (AOR: 2 center dot 34, 95 % CI 1 center dot 48, 3 center dot 70 and 1 center dot 92, 95 % CI 1 center dot 34, 2 center dot 74) with lower health literacy. Women in food-insecure households reported preparing a lower proportion of breakfasts (beta = -0 center dot 051, 95 % CI -0 center dot 085, -0 center dot 017), lunches (beta = -0 center dot 062, 95 % CI -0 center dot 098, -0 center dot 026) and total meals at home (beta = -0 center dot 041, 95 % CI -0 center dot 065, -0 center dot 016). Men and women identifying as Black or Indigenous, reporting financial difficulty and with lower levels of education had heightened odds of experiencing food insecurity. Conclusions: Findings are consistent with other studies underscoring the financial precarity, rather than lack of food skills, associated with food insecurity. This precarity may reduce opportunities to apply health literacy and undertake meal preparation.

AB  - Food safety is linked to food security through health and livelihoods, and improving food safety is necessary to address food security. An international consensus has emerged that the best way to address food safety is through a risk-based, farm-to-table approach that focuses on cost-effective prevention. In developing countries, this approach has been implemented in supply chains for high-value markets, particularly exports. Evidence shows that improvements are possible where market incentives exist, and where market institutions can ensure that risk reduction practices are followed. To address food safety for food insecure consumers in developing countries, public efforts should focus on the most important risks and cost-effective controls, provide support for capacity building and supply chain coordination, and improve incentives for food safety management.

AB  - Food insecurity and other nutritional risks in infancy pose a lifelong risk to wellbeing; however, their effect on diet quality in Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and Filipino (NHPIF) infants in Hawai'i is unknown. In this cross-sectional analysis, the association between various indicators of food security and NHPIF infant diet quality were investigated in 70 NHPIF infants aged 3-12 months residing on O'ahu, Hawai'i. The dietary assessments of the infants were collected using a mobile food record(TM). Foods consumed across four days were categorized into seven food groups. Indicators for food security were examined through an adapted infant food security index and other indicators. Data were analyzed using chi-square tests, independent sample t-tests, multinomial logistic regression, and linear regression models. In models adjusting for age and sex, infants defined as food insecure by the adapted index were found to consume foods from more food groups and consume flesh foods on a greater proportion of days. Of the indicators examined, the adapted index was shown to be the best indicator for food group consumption. Further work is needed on a more representative sample of NHPIF infants to determine the impact that food security has on nutritional status and other indicators of health.

AB  - Access to food as a critical factor in determining individuals' well-being in low income countries is of grave importance both in theory and public policy. Therefore this study, designed to enhance our understanding of food (in)security's impact on quality of life, presents a micro-level analysis of factors associated with food provision, food satisfaction, and happiness in Ghana. Our empirical analysis first investigates the patterns and variations of food provision among Ghanaian households, and then evaluates how the provision factors, along with other socio-economic status and reciprocal behaviors, affect avowed well-being as measured by (1) the household heads' subjective sense of being nonpoor and (2) reported feelings of happiness. The data are drawn from the Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ) survey conducted in 2003, with a sample of 40,481 households. Regression outcomes reveal that the usage of land, owning of livestock and amount of food spending particularly favor male-headed households' food security, which in turn leads men not to endorse "feeling poor" and, instead, to report greater happiness than is the case, in most instances, for women. Familial reciprocity also strengthens subjective well-being by way of increasing food security among Ghanaians. Family values as such, rather than decline in significance, appear to play a critical role in food security in Ghana.

AB  - This study to investigated food security and productivity among urban farmers' in Kaduna State Two-stage sampling procedure was used to select 213 respondents for the study. Interview schedule was used to collect data. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics (food security index, food insecurity/surplus gap index and productivity index) and multiple regression model. The results show that 54.5% of the households were food insecure. The average daily per capita calorie intake for food secure households was 65516.28 kcal. The mean age of the respondents was 46 years old, 46% had tertiary education and average farm size was 1.25 ha. Regression model predicted food security status at 70.3% accuracy with MacFadden R-square of 0.13. This implies that all variables were able to explain 64% of the variation in food security status of the households, implying that on average, the probability of urban farming households will be food secure at 51%. The log-likelihood was significant at 1% and the average marginal effect was 0.51. All the variables included were able to explain 64% of the variation in food security status of the households. Therefore, it recommended that viral extension services and appropriate measures to be implemented to change behaviour of urban farmers and boost their productivity, thereby reducing food insecurity and increase income of urban farmers in the area.

If from these it were possible to produce estimates of the likely changes in commodity flows to different population groups, the effects of short run fluctuations in food supply could be anticipated. How this might be done using a Food Accounting Matrix (FAM) as a data base is demonstrated. The simulations are based on proportional change. The limitations of proportionality assumptions are discussed.

AB  - The global food system has been subject to a multitude of shocks in recent years, drawing renewed attention to food insecurity vulnerabilities. Extreme weather events, economic crises, a global pandemic and wars have caused significant disruptions, compromising food security for significant portions of the population. Shocks impacting upon food systems bear additional adverse outcomes where populations are already vulnerable to poverty and other social inequalities, and increasingly, shocks are affecting populations not previously considered food insecure. This paper, and the Symposium it introduces, articulates an emerging field of study that explores the dynamic interplay of food system shocks and food security through multiple disciplinary perspectives. The articles in this Symposium address the impacts of and responses to shocks such as weather events and the COVID-19 pandemic and consider these through the theoretical lenses of actor perspectives, governance, and transitions. This Symposium looks beyond the short-term acute event and contributes to a systemic understanding of 'food shocks' by reflecting on how enduring and persistent disruptions reverberate through multiple layers of food systems, how they are experienced and addressed across global and local scales, and how they may deeply transform food systems and impact people over time.

AB  - Introduction: Increasing food and nutritional inequities are apparent in urban settings across Low-and Middle -Income Countries (LMICs), along with nutrition transition towards ultra-processed diets high in fat, sugar, and salt. In urban informal settlements, characterized by insecurity and inadequate housing and infrastructure, food systems dynamics and their nutritional implications are poorly understood. Objectives: This paper explores the food system determinants of food and nutrition security in urban informal settlements in LMICs with the goal of identifying effective approaches and entry points for policy and program. Methods: Scoping review. Five databases were screened spanning the period 1995 to 2019. A total of 3748 re-cords were assessed for inclusion based on title and abstract followed by 42 full text reviews. At least two re-viewers assessed each record. Twenty-four final publications were included, coded, and synthesized. Results: Factors influencing food security and nutrition in urban informal settlements can be organized into three interconnected levels. Macro-level factors include globalization, climate change, transnational food corporations, international treaties and regulations, global and national policies such as SDGs, insufficient social aid programs, and formalization or privatization. Meso-level factors include gender norms, inadequate infrastructure and services, insufficient transportation, informal food retailers, weak municipal policies, marketing strategies, and (lack of) employment. Micro-level factors comprise gender roles, cultural expectations, income, social networks, coping strategies, and food (in) security.Conclusions: Greater policy attention should focus at the meso-level, with priority investments in services and infrastructure within urban informal settlements. The role and engagement of the informal sector is an important consideration in improving the immediate food environment. Gender is also crucial. Women and girls have a central role in food provisioning but are more vulnerable to various forms of malnutrition. Future research should include context-specific studies in LMIC cities as well as promoting policy change using a participatory and gender transformative approach.

AB  - In response to food contamination scandals worldwide, retail giant Walmart is tackling food safety in the supply chain using blockchain technology. In 2016, it established the Walmart Food Safety Collaboration Center in Beijing and plans to invest $25 million over five years to research global food safety (Yiannas and Liu, 2017). Using IBM's blockchain solution based on Hyperledger Fabric, Walmart has successfully completed two blockchain pilots: pork in China and mangoes in the Americas (IBM, 2017). With a farm-to-table approach, Walmart's blockchain solution reduced time for tracking mango origins from seven days to 2.2 seconds and promoted greater transparency across Walmart's food supply chain (Yiannas, 2017). IBM called it "complete end-to-end traceability" (McDermott, 2017). This case study highlights the challenges of implementing blockchain technology in the food supply chain and the opportunities for deploying blockchain solutions throughout the global food ecosystem to increase safety and reduce waste.

AB  - Food waste is a vast issue global, including in Malaysia. Food waste brings negative impacts, including increasing food production costs, impact on human health, and environmental degradation. Malaysian's animal- and plant-based diet preferences affected the desired food waste decomposition method as most of the methods only allow plant-based material to be utilized as food waste compost. The objectives of this study were to understand Malaysians' awareness of food waste behaviour and the food waste component for the decomposition. Malaysians usually produce more plant-based food waste than animal-based food waste. Most Malaysians have a high awareness of causes and impact of food waste, but they lack action on food waste reduction. Bio-compost is believed to be the most effective method to manage food waste, and most of them were willing to have it at home. However, some of them are unwilling to have a compost pile at home because there is no time to take care of it.

AB  - The growing world population and the growing need for food are raising the importance of more efficient and sustainable food production systems. Food loss is a significant global challenge and a major stressor on natural resources. True assessment of food loss is a precursor to its reduction. This study aimed to assess the actual food loss in the Norwegian farmed salmon production system in the year 2019 by quantifying the protein flows and stocks in the system. Protein served as an indicator substance of the true systemic food loss. This study highlights the system's qualitative value-adding conversion of plant protein into higher quality marine animal protein, with deposited vital trace minerals harvested from the sea and carried to the human food chain. However, it takes a lot of protein from multiple sources to produce salmon. We found that the total invested feed protein is about four times more than the harvested salmon protein, and about 40% of that harvested protein in the salmon biomass departs the human food chain by flowing to other non-food industries. The current post-harvest practices, material trade-offs, and waste management solutions could be adjusted to a context that prioritizes human food security. An alternative scenario is presented in this study, based on a hypothetical new food product in parallel to the main salmon fillet product. The alternative scenario turned 99% of the harvested protein into food and adjusted the ratio between the invested marine protein and the human food product protein. The originality of this research is in its approach to food loss assessment at the industrial level by means of a systemic macronutrient (protein) inventory.

AB  - Globally, approximately one billion people benefit from contributions of wild foods to their food security and dietary diversity. Wild foods are known to be important in rural communities in terms of food and micronutrient provision, diversifying diets, reducing vulnerability to non-communicable diseases and overall health. However, the potential contribution of wild foods towards food security and dietary diversity in urban food systems has been largely overlooked. This study examined the contribution of wild foods to household dietary diversity in two towns in South Africa, based on a survey of 137 households. Household diets were quite diverse, with half (51%) having consumed >= 8 food groups, 39% consumed 6 or 7 food groups, and only 10% recorded <= 5 food groups in the previous 48 h. Wild foods were prevalent across the sample, with 62% of the households consuming them to some degree. Wild vegetables and fruits were the most common wild foods, consumed by 96 and 79% of the households, respectively. Although wild foods had limited significance on overall dietary diversity, they exhibited substantial contributions within particular food groups. For example, the consumption of vegetables and oil and fats was most prevalent among households consuming wild foods than those who did not. The findings show that wild foods could contribute towards diversifying urban diets at a micro-level, within particular food groups consumed, such as vegetables and fruits. Hence, wild foods are important in ameliorating the monotonous diets of some households and in turn promoting dietary diversity.

AB  - It is recognized that human activities, such as fossil fuel burning, land-use change, and forest harvesting at a large scale, have resulted in the-increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere since the onset of the industrial revolution. The increasing amounts of greenhouse gases, particularly CO2 in the atmosphere, is believed to have induced climate change and global warming. With the ability to remove CO2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, forests play a critical role in the carbon cycle and carbon sequestration at both global and local scales. It is necessary to understand the relationship between forest soil carbon dynamics and carbon sequestration capacity, and the impact of forest management practices on soil CO2 efflux for sustainable carbon management in forest ecosystems. This paper reviews a number of current issues related to (1) carbon allocation, (2) soil respiration, and (3) carbon sequestration in the forest ecosystems through forest management strategies. The contribution made by forests and forest management in sequestrating carbon to reduce the CO2 concentration level in the atmosphere is now well recognized. The overall carbon cycle, carbon allocation of the above- and belowground compartments of the forests, soil carbon storage and soil respiration in forest ecosystems and impacts of forest management practices on soil respiration are described. The potential influences of forest soils on the buildup of atmospheric carbon are reviewed.

AB  - Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) are widely recognized for their support of biodiversity conservation and forest restoration in tropical developing countries. In the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHTs) of Bangladesh, ethnic forest-dependent communities have long maintained the Village Common Forest (VCF), an ancestral forest managed for community well-being. In recent years, some VCFs in the CHT have received support from local and international NGOs due to their perceived role in supporting biodiversity, ecosystem services, and improving local livelihoods. Although such support remains limited, its impacts on forest restoration and vegetation are not yet fully investigated. In the present study, we used remote sensing techniques and field surveys to measure vegetation cover changes and tree diversity in selected VCFs in the area. Our findings indicate that vegetation condition and tree diversity were better in NGO-supported VCFs compared with those without NGO intervention. Based on our study, we recommend increasing NGO involvement in VCF management with a more holistic and ecosystem-based approach, fostering institutional cooperation addressing land ownership issues, developing a market for forest ecosystem services, and improving local capacity for science-based forest management and ecosystem restoration in the CHT.

AB  - In Ukraine, the problem of providing food to the population is particularly acute today. Because of the decline in the food supply potential of the agro industrial complex, there was a fall in production and a decrease in the quality of agricultural products. This situation has led to the fact that imported agricultural products are gradually displacing domestic products from the market, which leads to higher prices and a shortage of high quality products. One of the main reasons that impedes the proper functioning of the market is the problem of managing food flows in the sales area. In this situation, there is a certain threat to food security in the regional market, so to meet the needs of the population in food products it is necessary to form a methodology for studying the regional food market based on the principles of logistical management of food flows. At the same time, the external environment of agricultural producers is becoming more dynamic, uncertain and complex, requiring a high level of adaptation and stability of the formed flow control systems. That is why the current practice of flow management in agricultural enterprises characterized by an intensive transition from coordination of individual logistics functions or operations to integrated management of logistics business processes, as well as ensures the development of production and logistics management in the direction of concentration and increase the value chain of agribusiness products.

AB  - Land-use change frequently reduces local species diversity. Species losses will often result in loss of trait diversity, with likely consequences for community functioning. However, the converse need not be generally true: management approaches that succeed in retaining species richness could nevertheless fail to maintain trait diversity. We evaluated this possibility using bee communities in a California agroecosystem. We examined among site patterns in bee species diversity and functional-trait diversity in a landscape composed of a mosaic of semi-natural habitat, organic farms and conventional farms. We sampled bees from all three habitat types and compiled a data base of life-history (functional') traits for each species. Although species richness was higher on organic farms than conventional farms, functional diversity was lower in both farm types than in natural habitat. Nesting location (below-ground vs. above-ground) was the primary trait contributing to differences in functional diversity between farms and natural habitat, reflecting observed differences in availability of nesting substrates among habitat types. Other traits, including phenology and sociality, were also associated with species' occurrences or dominance in particular site types. These patterns suggest that management practices common to all farms act as environmental filters that cause similarly low functional diversity in their bee communities.Synthesis and applications. Although our results support the value of organic farming in maintaining abundant and species-rich bee communities, components of bee functional diversity are not well supported in farmed landscapes, regardless of farming practice. Maintenance of natural habitat, and/or the addition of natural habitat elements to farms, is therefore important for the retention of functionally diverse bee assemblages in agroecosystems. Although our results support the value of organic farming in maintaining abundant and species-rich bee communities, components of bee functional diversity are not well supported in farmed landscapes, regardless of farming practice. Maintenance of natural habitat, and/or the addition of natural habitat elements to farms, is therefore important for the retention of functionally diverse bee assemblages in agroecosystems.

AB  - This article reviews the current landscape regarding food fortification in the United States; the content is based on a workshop sponsored by the North American Branch of the International Life Sciences Institute. Fortification of the food supply with vitamins and minerals is a public health strategy to enhance nutrient intakes of the population without increasing caloric intake. Many individuals in the United States would not achieve recommended micronutrient intakes without fortification of the food supply. The achievement and maintenance of a desirable level of nutritional quality in the nation's food supply is, thus, an important public health objective. While the addition of nutrients to foods can help maintain and improve the overall nutritional quality of diets, indiscriminate fortification of foods could result in overfortification or underfortification in the food supply and nutrient imbalances in the diets of individuals. Any changes in food fortification policy for micronutrients must be considered within the context of the impact they will have on all segments of the population and of food technology and safety applications and their limitations. This article discusses and evaluates the value of fortification, the success of current fortification efforts, and the future role of fortification in preventing or reversing nutrient inadequacies.

AB  - Inequalities by gender and intersecting sources of social differentiation in access to resources, exercise of agency, and desirable outcomes persist in agri-food systems in low- and middle income countries. Despite decades of development and theoretical assessment efforts calling for multiscale approaches to addressing inequalities in agri-food systems, common approaches remain specific to a scale rather than holistic. In this paper, we make the case that achieving lasting equality and empowerment in agri-food systems requires transformative change. This depends on fostering an enabling environment by relaxing 'deeper' - often interrelated - institutionalized constraints to equality and empowerment across multiple nested scales of the state, markets, communities, household and individuals. Based on a review of recent literature focused on agri-food systems in low- and middle income countries, we present newly emerging thinking and a status update of key structural constraints to equality at different scales - rooted in policy and discriminatory, formal and informal, social and economic institutions, including norms. We give examples that show how structural constraints to equality at different nested scales are interdependent and mutually reinforcing; demonstrating the need for holistic approaches tackling constraints at multiple scales to foster transformative change in agri-food systems. We recommend designing holistic policy and development programs that combine strategies for relaxing constraints to equality and empowerment at multiple scales using inclusive processes of tailoring and prioritizing. To inform the design of such programs, we present recent evidence of effective or promising strategies for addressing structural constraints to equality that relate to policy, market systems, collectives and norms.

AB  - This study presents a current status and future trends of innovative and environmentally sustainable technological solutions for the post-harvest food supply chain and the food industry, in terms of ecological packaging, active, and/or intelligent packaging. All these concerns are currently highlighted due to the strong increase in the purchase/sale of products on online platforms, as well as the requirements for stricter food security and safety. Thus, this study aims to increase the global awareness of agro-industrial micro, small, and medium size enterprises for the adoption of innovative food solutions though industry digitalization (Industry 4.0), associated logistics and circular economy, with a concern for cybersecurity and products information, communication and shelf-life extension. The adoption of these guidelines will certainly foster along the complete food chain (from producer to consumer, with all intermediary parties) the awareness on environmentally sustainable technological solutions for the post-harvest food supply chain, and thus, promoting the future food sustainability required by the population increase, the climate change, the exodus of rural population to urban areas, and food loss and waste.

AB  - Over the years, food supply chains (FSCs) have faced various challenges, including supply chain interruptions. Previous studies focused only on household food waste. In this study, the FSCs risks is connected with food wastage to develop sustainable framework to reduce food waste. A Pareto analysis is developed for risk identification based on feedback from 130 experts from food companies. Finally, a blended grey-based Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) model has been proposed to assess the relationships among the identified major risks in FSCs. The five risks of greatest priority include: lack of skilled personnel, poor leadership, failure within the IT system, capacity, and poor customer relationship. The risk mitigation strategies for these risks are also presented. The proposed model is applied to food processing companies in Bangladesh to establish a sustainable business policy to minimize food wastage. These results can guide managers and practitioners to formulate resilient strategies to mitigate the identified risks, thereby minimizing food wastage and lead to food safety, security and sustainability across the food supply chain. The proposed model can be extended to address sustainability risk and be integrated to the internet of things for planning, monitoring, controlling, and optimizing supply chains in real time.

AB  - We present a compelling rationale for defining agroecology as the ecology of food systems. Our purpose is to provide a framework that will guide research, education, and action in the multiple and interacting facets of an increasingly complex global agriculture and food system. To accomplish such goals, it is essential to build bridges and connections among and beyond our disciplines in production agriculture, as well as beyond the farm gate into the rural landscape and community. Fields of sociology, anthropology, environmental sciences, ethics, and economics are crucial to the mix. They provide additional vantage points from which we can view the food system anew, as well as insights on how to establish valuation criteria beyond neoclassical economics. Examples from Mexico, California, and the Nordic Region are used to illustrate the successful implementation of this educational strategy in universities. Design of individual farms using principles of ecology is expanded to the levels of landscape, community, and bioregion, with emphasis on uniqueness of place and the people and other species that inhabit that place. We conclude that defining agroecology as the ecology of food systems will foster the development of broader interdisciplinary research teams and attractive systems-based courses for tomorrow's best students. In contrast to the narrow focus on crop-soil interactions, this definition will help us raise higher-level research questions whose solutions will advance the development of a sustainable agriculture and food system.

AB  - The livelihood changes due to the COVID-19 policies in low-income and transitional economies serve as a lever for gauging the structural resilience of national food systems. Yet, few studies have addressed the cascading effects of the pandemic policies on the livelihood changes of farming system actors or modeled and provided coherent hypotheses about the transitory structural shifts at the micro-level. Other studies on the subject have either captured the early impacts of the pandemic on food systems with limited or no insight into the sub-Saharan African context or have used macro-level data, due to sparsely available micro-level data. These early insights are relevant for the design of early warning systems. However, an ongoing and deeper insight into the effects of pandemic policies is critical, since new and more comprehensive policies are needed to address the economic fallout and the extenuating effects of COVID-19 on food supply chain disruptions. The overriding questions are as follows: what are the effects of the pandemic policies on the livelihoods of food system actors and are there spatial-economic variations in the effects of the pandemic policies on the livelihoods of the farming system actors? Using 2019 and 2020 primary data from 836 farming system actors in Ghana, we offer fresh insights into the transitory micro-level livelihood changes caused by the COVID-19 anticontagion policies. We analyzed the data using the generalized additive, subset regression, classical linear, and logistic regression models in a machine learning framework. We show that the changes in the livelihood outcomes of the food system actors in Ghana coincide with the nature of pandemic mitigation policies adopted in the spatial units. We found that the lockdown policies had a negative and significant effect on the livelihoods of the farming system actors in the lockdown areas. The policies also negatively affected the livelihoods of the farming system actors in distant communities that shared no direct boundary with the lockdown areas. On the contrary, the lockdown policies positively affected the livelihoods of the farming system actors in the directly contiguous communities to the lockdown areas. We also document the shifts in the livelihood outcomes of the farming system actors, such as income, employment, food demand, and food security in the different spatial policy areas.

AB  - The current contribution of wild animal proteins has been poorly quantified, particularly in the rapidly growing urban centers of tropical forests. Lack of such evidence impairs food security strategies to include the diversity of food supply inherent to traditional food systems. In this study we focus on wild sources of animal protein: wild fish and bushmeat, which have traditionally been important in people's diets in the Amazon. We compare the consumption of wild and non-wild (domestic, processed) sources of animal proteins in a rural to urban gradient in the Colombian Amazon. In rural areas, most people are indigenous from the Ticuna ethnical group, while in urban areas, the population is a result of a mixture of different indigenous groups, mestizos and colonos. Our results show that, despite its geographical position, the region is increasingly dependent on domestic and industrialized sources of animal protein. The frequency of wild fish and bushmeat consumption decreases from rural to urban areas to the advantage of domestic and processed meat/fish. Patterns of animal protein consumption for indigenous children indicate that indigenous families adopt non-indigenous consumption patterns when they move to town. Bushmeat consumption in urban areas is more frequent in wealthier families and could be considered as a luxury product. In urban areas, chicken is the protein of the poor and beef replaces chicken for the families that can afford it. In rural settings, chicken replaces wild sources of animal protein as people increase their income and move away from forest/agriculture dependent livelihoods. Despite, the low importance of bushmeat and wild fish in urban areas measured in terms of consumption frequencies, we show that these foods continue to play an important role in terms of dietary diversity, which is fundamental to eradicate energy and micronutrient deficiencies. The increased consumption of industrial chicken in rural communities poses important food security issues because it provides less nutritional balance than wild foods and access to this protein is dependent on the availability of cash in rural communities. While the harvest of wild proteins poses a sustainability problem, industrial foods also carry a heavy ecological footprint. In conclusion our results call for a better attention to the changes observed in diets in the Amazon, given their potential food security and ecological consequences.

AB  - In Guyana, the coastal plains dominate agricultural production, while the hinterland is an emerging agricultural frontier. The coastal and hinterland regions have differing agro-climatic conditions, but share immediate climate change and environmental degradation pressures, including soil degradation. Even though climate change adaptation is prioritized over greenhouse gas mitigation in Guyana, soil-focused farming, otherwise known as sustainable soil management (SSM), can provide a system that creates synergies between these two facets of climate-smart agriculture and, also, promotes soil security. This article proposes a bottom-up planning process for SSM in Guyana by assessing its underlying psycho-social and physical facilitators and barriers. The main questions addressed are: what are the attitudes of Guyanese farmers to climate change? What are their capabilities for SSM, in terms of education, technology and government support? In answering these questions, inductive-derived thematic analysis of transcripts derived from in-depth telephone interviews with seventeen (17) farmers, from coastal and hinterland regions, provides an initial basis for ground truthing on the local appropriateness of SSM. Results show that hinterland farmers are more emotive and value-driven about their environment, while coastal farmers, instead, prioritize access to markets and gaining favorable prices for their commodities. Additionally, the lack of education and training are identified as severe limitations to the capabilities of farmers to practice SSM. In conclusion, a weak marketing environment is seen as a binding constraint of sustainable intensification as surplus goods attract low prices. Stronger linkages to dynamic markets, as well as increased investment opportunities are needed for sustainable farming to become economically feasible. Therefore, psychosocial capital must be strengthened before any natural capital is improved under Guyana's various agro-environmental policies.

AB  - Domestication of novel crops from the wild is a key process that ensures food security by addressing adaptability to changing environments. These wild plants offer broader and unique health benefits beyond basic nutrition. Salinization resulted in a drastic reduction of arable land and freshwater intended for cultivation. Thus, the global food production is currently under a risk of meeting the demands. Salt-tolerant plants (i.e., halophytes) are potential food candidates that can be used to increase the productivity of salinized land and also to enhance the diversification of food production. Salicornia can survive under hypersaline and extreme climatic conditions and deliver tender shoots and dried seeds that can be used as a food with a unique taste, texture, and therapeutic benefits. Although Salicornia is not equally popular among all the food cultures globally, it has been consumed over centuries, and it is now making its way to the shelves of supermarkets in some countries such as the United States, UAE, South Korea, and Mexico. Despite being an underutilized crop, Salicornia possesses an array of chemical compounds or basic derivatives that can enhance antioxidant, anti-obesity, antidiabetes, anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, and neuroprotective properties of human nutrition. The presence of considerable amounts of nutritional elements and various functional bioactive phytochemicals have opened up avenues of using Salicornia as a functional food. The present paper reviews the recognition of Salicornia as a functional food and a potential cash crop in saline agriculture to enhance agricultural productivity and also to diversify the current food supply chain.

AB  - Providing universal food security and conserving biodiversity are prominent challenges facing humanity in the 21st century. Typically, these challenges are believed to involve a trade-off, especially in farming landscapes of the Global South. We conducted a multivariate analysis of social-ecological data from 110 landscapes in the Global South, and found that different system characteristics lead to partly predictable outcomes, resulting either in trade-offs or, unexpectedly, in synergies (mutual benefits) between food security and biodiversity. Specifically, these synergies are fostered by social equity, by reliable access to local land, and by increasing social capital (eg maintenance of traditions) and human capital (eg health). In contrast, we also found high degrees of food security in landscapes with adequate infrastructure, market access, and financial capital, but this increased security came at the expense of biodiversity. Our findings demonstrate that a social-ecological systems perspective can help to identify previously unrecognized synergies between food security and biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Halal food supply chain is unique as it is based on Islamic teachings and hence different from other kinds of supplier management. However, research in this specific field has been scarce, particularly empirical research. Conversely, many empirical researches on conventional supply chain management have focused mainly on supply risks. Therefore, it is important to explore supplier management in halal food supply chains by applying an existing framework of supplier management from other fields. With this in mind, as a preliminary case study, this paper explores supplier management of a small and medium-sized enterprise producing halal foods in Malaysia. The main aim is to identify risk consequences, risk drivers, supply risk sources, and risk mitigating strategies for supplier management in halal food supply chains. Future research needs to include and investigate more cases in which factors such as the size of companies, the capacity and role of halal certification bodies, and the location of operation are operationalized in order to develop the framework discussed in this study

AB  - This article analyzes how trade liberalization in Mexico, particularly following the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), has transformed that nation's cattle economy into a feedlot system manifesting multiple telecouplings and based on the transnational provision of inputs. A conceptual model is presented that suggests how environmental effects involving land use and GHG emissions emerge from changes in the beef supply chain. The article then presents an empirical analysis establishing that the production of corn and beef has intensified in the wake of NAFTA, and that deforestation rates have declined over the same period. Evidence is also presented showing that this has not precipitated a land sparing effect, given the leakage of deforestation into Central America, which supplies Mexican feedlots with 36 % of their source materials. The article calculates associated GHG emissions and establishes that enteric fermentation dominates deforestation as a source, and that ~14% of GHGs produced by the post-NAFTA Mexican supply chain are emitted in Central America. This raises accounting questions for signatories to the Paris Climate Treaty, given commitments are nation-based.

AB  - Extensive livestock production is a major deforestation driver in the Brazilian Amazon. This study presents an assessment of the economic and environmental feasibility of sustainable livestock intensification in Sao Felix do Xingu municipality, a deforestation frontier with an area of more than 8.5 million hectares, and home to the largest cattle herd in Brazil. Proposed intensification was limited to approximately three animal units per hectare to avoid negative environmental impacts. Transition costs to sustainable cattle intensification were estimated for thirteen pilot farms taking into account adoption of good agriculture practices, pasture maintenance/restoration, and restoration of environmental liabilities. To move to sustainable intensification practices, a mean total annual investment of US$ 1335/ha +/- US$ 619/ha would be necessary, varying from US$ 750 to US$ 2595/ha. Internal rate of return and net present value estimates indicated that the sustainable livestock intensification approach proposed was profitable in farms with more than 400 hectares of pastureland, but not in those where the pasture areas were smaller than 150 hectares. Livestock sustainable intensification also had the potential to promote social and environmental benefits, including a 54% increase in the number of contract workers, improvement of landowners' managerial skills, and workers' training, in addition to avoiding emission of 1.9 Mt CO(2)eq and sequestration of 0.36 Mt CO(2)eq. We conclude that the sustainable intensification of pasture areas has the potential to prevent further deforestation in the Amazon while generating social and other environmental benefits.

AB  - Land-cover types were analyzed for 1970, 1990 and 2000 as the bases for determining land-use systems and their influence on the resilience of tropical rain forests in the Tehuantepec Isthmus, Mexico. Deforestation (DR) and mean annual transformation rates were calculated from land-cover change data; thus, the classification of land-use change processes was determined according to their impact on resilience: a) Modification, including landcover conservation and intensification, and b) Conversion, including disturbance and regeneration processes. Regeneration processes, from secondary vegetation under extensive use, cultivated vegetation under intensive use, and cultivated or induced vegetation under extensive use to mature or secondary vegetation, have high resilience capacity. In contrast, cattle-raising is characterized by rapid expansion, long-lasting change, and intense damages; thus, recent disturbance processes, which include the conversion to cattle-raising, provoke the downfall of the traditional agricultural system, and nullify the capacity of resilience of tropical rain forest. The land-use cover change processes reveal a) the existence of four land-use systems ( forestry, extensive agriculture, extensive cattle-raising, and intensive uses) and b) a trend towards the replacement of agricultural and forestry systems by extensive cattle-raising, which was consolidated during 1990 - 2000 (DR of evergreen tropical rain forest = 4.6%). Only the forestry system, which is not subject to deforestation, but is affected by factors such as selective timber, extraction, firewood collection, grazing, or human-induced fire, is considered to have high resilience ( 2 years), compared to agriculture ( 2 - 10 years) or cattle-raising ( nonresilient). It is concluded that the analysis of land-use systems is essential for understanding the implications of land-use cover dynamics on forest recovery and land degradation in tropical rain forests.

AB  - Crop and livestock production have become spatially decoupled in existing commercial agricultural regimes throughout the world. These segregated high input production systems contribute to some of the world's most pressing sustainability challenges, including climate change, nutrient imbalances, water pollution, biodiversity decline, and increasingly precarious rural livelihoods. There is substantial evidence that by closing the loop in nutrient and energy cycles, recoupling crop and livestock systems at farm and territorial scales can help reduce the environmental externalities associated with conventional commercial farming without declines in profitability or yields. Yet such integrated crop and livestock systems remain rare as a proportion of global agricultural area. Based on an interdisciplinary workshop and additional literature review, we provide a comprehensive historical and international perspective on why integrated crop and livestock systems have declined in most regions and what conditions have fostered their persistence and reemergence in others. We also identify levers for encouraging the reemergence of integrated crop and livestock systems worldwide. We conclude that a major disruption of the current regime would be needed to foster crop-livestock reintegration, including a redesign of research programs, credit systems, payments for ecosystem services, insurance programs, and food safety regulations to focus on whole farm outcomes and the creation of a circular economy. An expansion of the number of integrated crop and livestock systems field trials and demonstrations and efforts to brand integrated crop and livestock systems as a form of sustainable agriculture through the development of eco-labels could also improve adoption, but would likely be unsuccessful at encouraging wide-scale change without a more radical transformation of the research and policy landscape.

AB  - Climate change and land use change are two forces influencing the hydrology of watersheds and their ability to provide ecosystem services, such as clean and well-regulated streamflow and control of soil erosion and sediment yield. The Soil Water Assessment Tool, SWAT a distributed, watershed-scale hydrological model was used with 18 scenarios of rainfall, temperature and infiltration capacity of land surface to investigate the spatial distribution of watershed services over the 3587 km(2) Nyando basin in Western Kenya and how it is affected by these two forces. The total annual water yield varied over the 50 sub-basins from 35 to 600 mm while the annual sediment yield ranged From 0 to 104 tons ha(-1). Temperature change had a relatively minor effect on streamflow and sediment yield compared to change in rainfall and land surface condition. Improvements in land surface condition that result in higher infiltration are an effective adaptation strategy to moderate the effects of climate change on supply of watershed services. Spatial heterogeneity in response to climate and land use change is large, and hence it is necessary to understand it if interventions to modify hydrology or adapt to climate change are to be effective.

AB  - Accurate predictions of the impacts of future land use change on species of conservation concern can help to inform policy-makers and improve conservation measures. If predictions are spatially explicit, predicted consequences of likely land use changes could be accessible to land managers at a scale relevant to their working landscape. We introduce a method, based on open source software, which integrates habitat suitability modelling with scenario-building, and illustrate its use by investigating the effects of alternative land use change scenarios on landscape suitability for black grouse Tetrao tetrix. Expert opinion was used to construct five near-future (twenty years) scenarios for the 800 km(2) study site in upland Scotland. For each scenario, the cover of different land use types was altered by 5-30% from 20 random starting locations and changes in habitat suitability assessed by projecting a MaxEnt suitability model onto each simulated landscape. A scenario converting grazed land to moorland and open forestry was the most beneficial for black grouse, and 'increased grazing' (the opposite conversion) the most detrimental. Positioning of new landscape blocks was shown to be important in some situations. Increasing the area of open-canopy forestry caused a proportional decrease in suitability, but suitability gains for the 'reduced grazing' scenario were nonlinear. 'Scenario-led' landscape simulation models can be applied in assessments of the impacts of land use change both on individual species and also on diversity and community measures, or ecosystem services. A next step would be to include landscape configuration more explicitly in the simulation models, both to make them more realistic, and to examine the effects of habitat placement more thoroughly. In this example, the recommended policy would be incentives on grazing reduction to benefit black grouse.

AB  - This study considers expanding beyond the current collective understanding of research on the impact of global food and agriculture laws on Africa's food security. This paper aims to answer two basic questions: are the current global food and agriculture laws capable of facilitating and supporting the goal of ending hunger in Africa and increasing food security; will the existing global food law promote fair and equitable food production and supply practices to benefit all who need it? This paper will answer the questions by using a qualitative approach to Africa's experience in dealing with the existing global food and agriculture laws. This will provide insight into understanding the law, the behaviour of society and the outcome of the application of the law in real life. This will enable us to identify the gap in the global food law addressing food security. The qualitative data in the study will help the in-depth explanation, exploration and understanding of the root cause of food insecurity. This is significant because of the growing tension between population growth and the demand for food which are incompatible, especially in Africa. Currently, Africa's population is estimated to be 1.3 billion people(1) and food production is not sufficient to feed the people. Of the almost 800 million people who are considered to be living with chronic hunger globally, the majority are from Africa.(2) A contemporary study suggests that the population growth in Africa is expected to double to 2.4 billion by 2050.(3) The question we have to ask here is if we cannot feed the current population, how can we feed the ever growing population and what can be done to overcome the deficit? This paper has sought to expose the primary gaps in the existing global food and agriculture laws, weakness and constrains. It is argued that the primary failing of the current global food and agriculture law in addressing food security should be tackled with great concern. It was found that negotiations on agriculture and food at various international forums should bear partial responsibility for the lack of commitment, consistency and transparency in addressing food security. In order to resolve the issue, it is argued that appropriate change in the system is needed, to ensure the fair distribution of benefits and burdens in society. The global food and agriculture law should, therefore, be able to provide a clear method to determine the future global food security.

AB  - This study examined the effects of agricultural intensity, various farming practices, landscape composition and vegetation cover on the abundance and species richness of wintering farmland birds, assessed simultaneously across seven European regions. The abundance and species richness of wintering farmland birds were negatively affected by agricultural intensity. The effects of yield and farm type were interlinked. Of the 10 farming practices assessed, mechanical weeding and the amount of organic fertilizer applied negatively affected farmland birds, presumably due to reduced food availability on arable fields. Positive effects of organic farming on farmland birds proved to be limited to simplified landscapes. More farmland birds were observed in areas with more stubble, pasture and green manure crops. Species richness was higher in areas with more pasture. The results of this study show that farm management, vegetation cover and landscape composition all influence wintering farmland birds. Heterogeneous landscapes comprising arable crops as well as grasslands support most species of farmland birds in winter. The effectiveness of organic farming and agri-environment schemes depends on landscape composition. Therefore, different agri-environment schemes should be designed for different landscape types.

AB  - This article examines the sustainability of livelihoods through urban agriculture (UA): gender dimensions in Accra, Ghana. The population used for the study was the vegetable producers within and around Accra, Ghana. A mix of sampling techniques was followed in choosing UA producers. While a random sampling technique was employed in choosing male UA producers, all female producers who were willing to be interviewed were chosen. In all, 92 male producers and 8 female producers gave consistent responses that were analyzed. The results show that the mean age for male producers is 39.4 years. Female producers are more elderly with a mean age of 49.8 years. The mean year of schooling is 6.4 years for male producers and 7.1 years for female producers. While all the households are involved in irrigated farming, only 13% male and 25% female managed farms practiced irrigated farming alone. The majority of the male and female farmers indicated that high contribution of urban agriculture to their livelihoods. Farm size and access to credit were significant determinants of income from. urban agriculture among the respondents.

AB  - We applied an ecological-economic modelling procedure to analyse the impact of organic versus conventional management of meadows on endangered bird and butterfly species in Saxony, Germany. Applying the modelling procedure enables us to focus on two aspects that hitherto have been neglected in analysing the impact of organic farming on biodiversity. (1) Possible differences in the timing of land use between organic and conventional farming, and (2) differences in the uptake of agri-environment schemes (AES) by organic and conventional farmers. We found that for the species considered the difference in the impact of conventional and organic farming is minor, because in our case study region the timing of land use on most areas with organic farming is very similar to the timing on areas with conventional farming. We also found that in comparison with conventional farmers, organic farmers generally face lower opportunity costs when implementing AES measures. Additionally, organic farmers are offered lower payments for such measures. These factors influence organic farmers' decisions to take part in AES, which in turn has an important impact on biodiversity conservation. In order to better conserve species it may be necessary to adapt the payment structure of AES with respect to organic farming.

AB  - Global food security depends on the continual improvement of a relatively small number of food and feed crops. Today's food supply is heavily dependent on the movement of seed and other forms of plant germplasm for these crops across national and regional borders. As occurred during the Green Revolution, facilitated and widespread exchange of the major food crops is critical for food security. Plant breeders, molecular biologists, and agronomists, using scientifically guided processes and working collaboratively around the world, are achieving greater gains in crop yields and quality in shorter times than in the past. However, newer policies emerging from international environmental negotiations are giving rise to restrictions that are limiting access and exchange of germplasm and threatening food security. We argue that these evolving policies and practices are having far-reaching and negative impacts on plant breeding, agriculture, and food security. We provide some ideas on how to steer future policy negotiations to encourage germplasm exchange and thereby support food security and other important environmental objectives.

AB  - Background: In 1995, a study was conducted to identify the effects of traditional and westernized environments on the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Pima Indians (Pimas) in Mexico and the United States. The study concluded that the more traditional lifestyle in Mexico had a protective effect against this metabolic disorder. In the ensuing 15 years, the environmental circumstances of the Mexican Pimas changed, and a follow-up study was conducted to determine the role environmental change plays in the development of diabetes in this genetically susceptible population. A major element of environmental transition relates to land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes that could affect physical activity and promote an obesogenic environment. This study examined changes in the region's LULC to determine whether there have been transitions in agricultural land use and urbanization that would be consistent with a more sedentary lifestyle. Changes were assessed from 1994 aerial photographs and 2007 satellite images. Results: The land-cover analysis showed that mixed vegetation and dense trees cover most of the study area. It suggested a rural environment that includes a low percentage of impermeable areas, and it indicated that the area experiencing human intervention covers 7% of the total area. The land-use-change findings showed a decrease or no change in agricultural or ranching areas and a decrease in farmland due to reforestation or revegetation. Three variables from the land-use-change analysis were examined as proxies for lifestyle change: urban development, dwelling-unit density, and variation in the road network. Two of the measures-the amount of urbanization and the number and density of dwelling units-showed increases, most notably in the town of Maycoba. There were only minor changes in the road network: most of the road segments are short and concentrated in Maycoba where most of the buildings, points of interest (e.g., church, stores), and cars are located. Conclusions: The LULC in Maycoba and surrounding settlements had changed during the study period. LULC change was used as a proxy to examine lifestyle changes that can affect levels of physical activity.

AB  - Deforestation is a main driver of climate change and biodiversity loss. An incentive mechanism to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) is being negotiated under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Here we use the best available global data sets on terrestrial biodiversity and carbon storage to map and investigate potential synergies between carbon and biodiversity-oriented conservation. A strong association (r(S) = 0.82) between carbon stocks and species richness suggests that such synergies would be high, but unevenly distributed. Many areas of high value for biodiversity could be protected by carbon-based conservation, while others could benefit from complementary funding arising from their carbon content. Some high-biodiversity regions, however, would not benefit from carbon-focused conservation, and could become under increased pressure if REDD is implemented. Our results suggest that additional gains for biodiversity conservation are possible, without compromising the effectiveness for climate change mitigation, if REDD takes biodiversity distribution into account.

AB  - The number of hungry people is on the rise and more efforts are needed to improve the global food security status. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) proposes more investment in the agricultural sector to boost production and alleviate hunger. However, there are fewer papers that distinguish enterprises investment from public investment. In this case, we take advantage of detailed investment data in the fDi Markets database to explore the global patterns of agricultural investment. In particular, we identify the top destination countries based on aggregate and sub-sectoral agricultural investment data. Then we investigate the relationship between agricultural investment and food security, which is measured by per capita protein intake. Finally, we propose some suggestions from the investment motivation perspective to help food-insecure countries to attract overseas investment. We find that developed countries are the primary sources of global agricultural investment and these sources have been becoming more diverse in the past decade. It implies the trend towards a more inclusive investment environment worldwide. However, the global distribution of agricultural investment is uneven as food-insecure countries only receive 20% of the global agricultural investment. The top three destination countries, USA, China, and Russia, have a relatively high food security level. In contrast, countries suffering from food insecurity receive fewer investment projects, and most of which are on a small scale. Given the limited socio-economic development status in food-insecure countries, it is essential for all levels of society to help them and contribute to ending hunger.

AB  - Meeting the anticipated 50% increase in global food demand by 2050 requires a crucial reassessment of agricultural practices, particularly in terms of nitrogen fertilizers inputs. This study analyzes the technical potential of nitrogen recovery from livestock manure and crop residues, bringing attention to the often-overlooked resource of digestate derived from anaerobic digestion. Our analysis highlights the significant capacity of the anaerobic digestion process, yielding approximately 234 +/- 5 million metric tons (Mt) of nitrogen annually, sourced 93% from livestock manure and 7% from crop residues. Additionally, we estimated that substituting synthetic nitrogen with nitrogen from anaerobic digestion has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 70% (185 Mt CO2-eq yr-1). Lastly, 2.5 billion people could be sustained by crops grown using nitrogen from anaerobic digestion of manure and crop residues rather than synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. Although agricultural residues have double the technical potential of current synthetic nitrogen fertilizer production, 30% of croplands encounter difficulties in satisfying their nitrogen needs solely through crop residues and anaerobic digestion manure. This deficiency primarily results from inefficient reuse attributed to geographical mismatches between crop and livestock systems. This underscores the urgent need to reconnect livestock and cropping systems and facilitate the transport and reuse of manure in crop production. In conclusion, the mobilization of these large amounts of nitrogen from livestock manure and crop residues will require to overcome the nitrogen from anaerobic digestion green premium with incentives and subsidies.

AB  - Biodiversity is known to be influenced by agricultural practices in many ways. However, it is necessary to understand how this relation takes place in particular agroecosystems, sociocultural contexts and for specific biological groups, especially in highly biodiverse places. Also, in order to systematically study and track how biodiversity responds or changes with agricultural practices, it is necessary to find groups that can be used as practical indicators. We conduct a study of beetle (Coleoptera) diversity in maize-based agricultural plots with heterogeneous management practices in the Central Valleys of Oaxaca, Mexico, a region with outstanding biodiversity and a long agricultural history. We use a mixture of local knowledge and multivariate statistics to group the plots into two broad and contrasting management categories (traditional vs. industrialized). Then, we present an analysis of Coleopteran diversity for each category, showing higher levels across different diversity indexes for the traditional plots. Specifically, Coleopteran guilds associated with natural pest control and soil conservation are more common in traditional plots than in industrialized ones, while herbivorous beetles are more abundant in the second. Also, our results let us postulate the Curculionidae family as an indicator of both management type and overall Coleopteran diversity in the agricultural lands of the study site. We discuss our results in terms of the agricultural matrix quality and its role in strategies that favor the coexistence of culturally meaningful agricultural systems and local biodiversity.

AB  - Agricultural policy is an important determinant of agricultural incomes in developed countries. In this light. policy change is expected to have a significant effect on agricultural incomes and thus on agricultural asset values. This analysis addresses the role of policy in determining agricultural land values in six important wheat-producing regions: the states of Kansas and North Dakota in the United States; the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan in Canada; and the regions of Centre and Picardie in France. The results indicate a strong relationship between support through agricultural policies, as measured by producer subsidy equivalents, and land values. Dynamic simulations of alternative policy scenarios suggest that policy reform to reduce subsidies of current policies will reduce land values in the EC and bring about modest increases in the U.S. and Canada.

AB  - The densely populated, intensively cropped subtropical highlands of the world have agricultural sustainability problems from soil erosion and fertility decline. In 1991, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) initiated a long-term field experiment at its semi-arid highland experiment station in Mexico (2240 masl; 19.31 degrees N, 98.50 degrees W; Cumulic Phaeozem) to investigate the long-term effects of tillage/seeding practices, crop rotations, and crop residue management on maize and wheat grown under rainfed conditions. Soil ecology status contributes to agricultural system sustainability, and evaluations were made to determine the effect of different management practices on soil microbial biomass (SMB) (substrate-induced respiration (SIR) and chloroform fumigation incubation (CFI)) and micro-flora physiological and catabolic diversity (BIOLOG (TM) ecoplate well system). SMB-C (CFI, SIR) was significantly and respectively 1.2 and 1.3 times higher for residue retention (average 387 mg C kg(dry soil)(-1) and 515 mg C kg(dry soil)(-1), respectively) compared to residue removal. SMB-C (CFI) was significantly higher for wheat (369 mg C kg(dry soil)(-1)) compared to maize (319 mg C kg(dry soil)(-1)). SMB-N (CFI) was significantly 1.3 times higher for residue retention (average 28 mg N kg(dry soil)(-1)) compared to residue removal. The average well color development (AWCD) obtained by the BIOLOG (TM) ecoplate essay indicated there were large differences in the catabolic capability of soil microbial communities after 15 years of contrasting management practices. While maize and wheat rotation under conventional tillage with residue retention showed a significantly higher overall AWCD value compared to the other treatments, AWCD of maize with zero tillage and residue removal was significantly lower than in the other treatments. AWCD was significantly higher for residue retention compared to residue removal and for wheat as compared to maize. For maize, the management practices were divided into two groups; zero tillage with residue removal was separate from all other treatments. For wheat, conventional tillage was separate from all zero tillage treatments. This study suggests that in the target area, a cropping system that includes zero tillage, crop rotation, and crop residue retention can increase overall biomass and micro-flora activity and diversity compared with common farming practices. in the long term, zero tillage combined with residue retention creates conditions favourable for the development of antagonists and predators, and fosters a new ecological stability. Zero tillage without residue retention is an unsustainable practice that leads to poor soil health in the long run. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Protected areas in tropical countries are managed under different governance regimes, the relative effectiveness of which in avoiding deforestation has been the subject of recent debates. Participants in these debates answer appeals for more strict protection with the argument that sustainable use areas and indigenous lands can balance deforestation pressures by leveraging local support to create and enforce protective regulations. Which protection strategy is more effective can also depend on (i) the level of deforestation pressures to which an area is exposed and (ii) the intensity of government enforcement. We examine this relationship empirically, using data from 292 protected areas in the Brazilian Amazon. We show that, for any given level of deforestation pressure, strictly protected areas consistently avoided more deforestation than sustainable use areas. Indigenous lands were particularly effective at avoiding deforestation in locations with high deforestation pressure. Findings were stable across two time periods featuring major shifts in the intensity of government enforcement. We also observed shifting trends in the location of protected areas, documenting that between 2000 and 2005 strictly protected areas were more likely to be established in high-pressure locations than in sustainable use areas and indigenous lands. Our findings confirm that all protection regimes helped reduce deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon.

AB  - Tillage information is crucial in environmental modelling as it has a direct impact on water holding capacity, evapotranspiration, carbon sequestration and water quality. In this study, a set of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)-based linear logistic models were developed for mapping tillage practices and verified with an independent dataset. For data collection purposes, 35 and 41 commercial fields were randomly selected in Moore and Ochiltree counties, respectively, in the Texas Panhandle. Tillage survey was planned and conducted to coincide with Landsat 5 satellite overpasses during the 2005 planting season and two TM scenes were acquired. Using the Moore County dataset, seven logistic regression models were developed and these were evaluated with the data collected from Ochiltree County. The overall classification accuracy of the models varied from 86% to 91% with the Moore County dataset. These models were evaluated against independent Ochiltree County dataset and resulted in somewhat less accurate (classification accuracy of 67-85%) but still useful results. Analysis of these results indicates that logistic regression models that have indices derived from the combination of TM band 5 with bands 4 or 6 may provide consistent and acceptably accurate results when they are applied in the same geographic region.

AB  - Small-scale fisheries are important for the livelihoods and food security of millions of people in low-income countries. Sustainably managing these dynamic social-ecological systems requires understanding links between ecosystems and human well-being: the focus of ecosystem service approaches. However, in-depth exploration of how co-production and temporal dynamics shape ecosystem benefits in small-scale fisheries remain nascent. There is thus an opportunity to better investigate pathways through which small-scale fisheries support food security. To address this gap, we ask how households allocate seafood landings across different uses, depending on supply and season. Using a daily survey, we collected panel data on landings from 15 households on Atauro Island, Timor-Leste, over six 1-week periods across three seasons, representing 630 survey days and 179 fishing trips. We found households mediate the pathways through which seafood contributes to food security. Specifically, the proportion of landings eaten, sold or shared changed with the amount landed and across seasons. As landings increased, households ate a smaller proportion and sold a greater proportion. The greatest proportion of landings were sold in the preparation season, when households save money to buy staple foods. Landings were shared with family and kin, reflecting the importance of seafood for social capital and community food security. Put broadly, households shaped a dynamic and non-linear (not directly proportional) relationship between service supply and benefits. Our findings demonstrate that seasonal context and livelihood priorities shape seafood provisioning benefits in small-scale fisheries. Careful consideration of temporal scale in ecosystem service assessments is critical for sustainable management of small-scale fisheries.

AB  - The livestock sector, especially in its intensive form, is considered highly relevant in the context of climate change due to its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. However, livestock production is necessary to feed the population and to conserve ecosystems services and cultural landscapes. On the other hand, extensive livestock farming can help to mitigate climate change through grazing. This study analyses how the combination of shrub clearing and grazing contributes to reducing forest fires and increasing organic carbon (SOC) storage in the soil. The study was conducted in the Northwestern Iberian System (Spain), a sparsely populated Mediterranean mid-mountain region. In the landscape predominates shrubs in different stages of plant succession after rural abandonment, with extensive livestock farming being the main economic activity. Since 1986, the regional government has cleared approximately 30% of shrublands, reducing the amount of available combustible material. The burned area has decreased from an average of 1,060 ha/year in the period 1968-1986 to 222.6 ha/year between 1987 and 2023. It has also been found that pastures regenerated after clearing, as well as managed forest plantations (thinning and grazing), accumulate more SOC than the shrublands. In these marginalized mountains there are people who want to continue living off local resources. Extensive livestock farming can help retain the population, while also contributing to climate change mitigation and providing ecosystem services to society.

AB  - Green technological progress (GTP) is crucial for environmental protection and economic growth in China. Over the past decades, China made huge GTP which exerts a far-reaching consequence on economic and social development. However, a paucity of research investigates the distributional effect of GTP. Meanwhile, we incorporate agricultural producer service sector into a three-sector general equilibrium model to reflect the modernization of small-scale agriculture. The agricultural producer service sector that acts as an intermediate sector can facilitate the utilization of intermediate inputs indirectly. To desalinate this process, a two-layer vertical production structure is established: parts of manufacturing goods are utilized by the service sector, outputs of which are intermediate inputs that could substitute labor in agriculture. Theoretical analysis shows that GTP increases both wage of skilled labor and unskilled labor. Nevertheless, GTP generates a greater impact on the wage of skilled labor than unskilled labor, leading to widening income disparity. Then, we examine the impact of GTP on wage inequality using a balanced panel data covering 30 provincial units in China during 2000-2019. In line with our theoretical conjecture, we find strong supportive evidences that GTP significantly widens the wage inequality.

AB  - The increasing global demand for sustainable agricultural practices and the quest for food security has intensified the need for alternative solutions to promote healthy growth in farm animals. One potential strategy is the use of probiotics derived from diverse sources, which remains relatively uncharted. In this context, this study aimed to assess the probiotic potentials of Bacillus velezensis D01Ca and Bacillus siamensis G01Bb, strains sourced from the gut of ducks and goats. Using two completely randomized experimental designs with 150-day-old broiler chickens, two distinct set-ups were implemented. In the first, broilers were subjected to either a control condition, a single dose of B. velezensis D01Ca at 2.4 x 107 cfu/ml, or its double dose. The second set-up followed a similar setup, but with B. siamensis G01Bb at 2.29 x 107 cfu/ml. Throughout the 42-day trial, all broilers consumed a commercial ration ad libitum and accessed water freely, with specific groups receiving the supplemented water based on the treatment. Results show that the feed intake of broilers remained unaffected by the probiotic supplementation, with no significant difference (P <= 0.05). However, broilers in the supplemented groups exhibited a noticeable increase in body weight and body weight gain when compared to the control. The feed conversion ratio, crucially, was consistent across all test groups. Conclusively, our findings suggest that B. velezensis D01Ca and B. siamensis G01Bb hold promise as viable probiotics for broiler chickens, offering potential strides toward sustainable agricultural practices and enhanced food security.

AB  - Given the need for scientific information to make better decisions to counteract pollution and environmental degradation, this research aimed to compare the maize-agroecosystem from an energy and economic perspective under two management practices: conservation and conventional in the Frailesca region of Chiapas, Mexico. Qualitative and quantitative variables were related through a factorial analysis of principal components. An interdisciplinary research methodology with socio-agronomic and economic approaches was used. Semistructured interviews were applied in 75 communities to 300 maize farmers who were grouped according to the type of practices implemented in the maize system: conventional or conservation agriculture. The variables analyzed for energy efficiency were: grain yield (t.ha(-1)), consumed energy (MJ), produced energy (MJ.ha(-1)), energy intensity and energy efficiency. Economic variables analyzed were net income, net outflow and income/cost ratio. Additionally, some land use variables were also analyzed. In the economic aspect, it was found that the main difference between both practices is the costs arising from soil preparation and stubble management which are higher for conventional maize management. In the energy aspect. conservation management differs from the conventional one by a more energy-use of efficiency expressed in the total energy required for production (5,854.55 MJ and 6,422.19 MJ, respectively). This efficiency comes mainly from the inputs used in the maize production process.

AB  - This research intended to evaluate to what extent the managers in family farms tend to adopt practices of organic farming and identify the possible factors that might be associated with those choices. For that, a survey was undertaken in Portuguese and Spanish municipalities. The participation, by direct interview, was voluntary and 125 valid responses were obtained distributed as: 30 in Viseu (PT), 30 in Braga (PT), 30 in Barcelos (PT), 16 in Pontevedra (SP) and 19 in Padron (SP). For the treatment of the data, basic descriptive statistics tools were used in combination with crosstabs and chi square tests. Also tree classifications were conducted following the Classification and Regression Trees algorithm. In all tests a level of significance of 5% was considered. The results identified factors that influenced the behaviour of the managers in family farms towards an approximation to organic farming practices, which were the level of education and municipality, found as major determinants of the level of compliance with organic farming practices. Also, other factors like age or gender influence, although to a lesser extent, the compliance with organic farming. These results were the same for the chisquare tests or the tree classification analysis, and they thus indicate that improvements could be achieved towards a more expressive adoption of organic farming practices if planned to target the influential factors identified.

AB  - In times of climate change, growing world population, and the resulting scarcity of resources, efficient and economical usage of agricultural land is increasingly important and challenging at the same time. To avoid disadvantages of monocropping for soil and environment, it is advisable to practice intercropping of various plant species whenever possible. However, intercropping is challenging as it requires a balanced planting schedule due to individual cultivation time frames. Maintaining a continuous harvest throughout the season is important as it reduces logistical costs and related greenhouse gas emissions, and can also help to reduce food waste. Motivated by the prevention of food waste, this work proposes a flexible optimization method for a full harvest season of large crop ensembles that complies with given economical and environmental constraints. Our approach applies evolutionary algorithms and we further combine our evolution strategy with a sophisticated hierarchical loss function and adaptive mutation rate. We thus transfer the multi-objective into a pseudo-single-objective optimization problem, for which we obtain faster and better solutions than those of conventional approaches.

AB  - Access to reliable and affordable energy is vital for sustainable development. In the off-grid areas of developing countries, decentralized energy solutions have received increasing attention due to their contributions to reducing poverty. However, most of the rural population in many developing countries still has little or no access to modern energy technologies. This paper assesses the factors that determine the successes and failures of decentralized energy solutions based on local harmonized case studies from heterogeneous contexts from Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and South America. The case studies were analyzed through the coupled lenses of energy transition and the Water-Energy-Food Security (WEF) Nexus. The findings indicate that access to modern decentralized energy solutions has not resulted in complete energy transitions due to various tradeoffs with the other domains of the WEF Nexus. On the other hand, the case studies point at the potential for improvements in food security, incomes, health, the empowerment of women, and resource conservation when synergies between decentralized energy solutions and other components of the WEF Nexus are present.

AB  - Introduction Owing to the increased transmissibility of the Omicron virus, Shanghai implemented a citywide lockdown in 2022. This measure disrupted the normal functioning of the city's food system and led to incidents related to food insecurity within the city. To mitigate these challenges, the local government and various stakeholders devised various solutions.Methods In this context, we adopted a root cause analysis to report the disruptions caused by the lockdown on Shanghai's food system.Results According to disruptions, we listed the challenges faced by Shanghai' food system and solutions implemented by the government and stakeholders.Discussion We discussed the underlying reasons behind food system disruptions and listed advantages of Shanghai's solutions. We further scrutinized the sustainability of the solutions implemented in Shanghai. Finally, we discussed how to promote the urban food system resilience building based on research findings. The findings of this research are anticipated to provide valuable insights for other areas that may encounter similar challenges in the future while fortify their urban food systems.

AB  - Pollinators are sensitive to agricultural intensification at both local and landscape scales. High configurational landscape heterogeneity due to small fields and a high amount of field boundaries is hypothesized to enhance farmland biodiversity. Here, we investigated the effects of organic vs. conventional farming in large- vs. small-scale agricultural landscapes on wild bee communities and their floral resources to improve conservation schemes for pollinators. We sampled bees in Central Germany at the field boundaries of 18 pairs of conventionally and organically managed winter wheat fields along the former iron curtain using pan traps and trap nests. Around traps, we surveyed species richness and flower cover of insect-pollinated forbs. Compared to conventional farming, organic farming was related to higher insect-pollinated forb species richness and flower cover in the field boundaries, presumably due to the lack of herbicide use. Interestingly, small-scale agriculture did not counteract the loss of floral resources under conventional management, as the difference to organic management was even larger in Western small-scale agriculture. Organic farming, but not small-scale agriculture, enhanced species richness of solitary bees, which is in line with their small home ranges. In contrast, bumblebees benefitted only from small-scale agriculture, which matches with their high dispersal ability. Despite similar levels of abundance and diversity of trap-nesting bees in the two landscape types, brood cell parasitism was also higher in small-scale agriculture. Both organic farming and small-scale agriculture directly and indirectly supported different groups of wild bees, suggesting long-term benefits for conservation. Agri environment schemes should acknowledge the so far neglected benefits of small-scale agriculture for biodiversity and its potential services.

AB  - The current paradigm of agricultural research and extension in support of rural development in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is to disseminate improved technologies designed to increase the generally low crop yields per hectare on individual farms. Using data from a baseline survey (n = 7,539) from a large rural development programme implemented in five countries in SSA, we calculate the increases in yield per hectare required to significantly contribute to poverty alleviation for households managing such farms. We estimate the gap between current crop productivity and the productivity required to reach a poverty line of $1.90 per capita per day adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). We find this gap to be very large, both in percentage and absolute terms. Median additional gross crop productivity required to reach this poverty threshold was: $324/ha/year (254% increase) in Mali; $1,359/ha/year (1,157% increase) in Niger; $4,989/ha/year (665% increase) in Ethiopia; $1,742/ha/year (818% increase) in Burkina Faso; $2,893/ha/year (1,297% increase) in Kenya. The required additional productivity taking account of production costs including the opportunity cost of family labor would need to be even higher. Given that (a) values of net productivity of improved rainfed crop technologies reported in the literature rarely exceed $1,000/ha/year; and (b) the majority of arable farms in SSA are two hectares or less with increasing trends toward land fragmentation, we argue that closing the yield gap among smallholder farmers in SSA will never-alone-be sufficient to meaningfully alleviate the high levels of poverty and deprivation many currently experience.

AB  - The problem of agricultural waste pollution has aroused wide concern around the world. An effective measure to solve this problem is to implement the compensation policy so as to encourage people to participate in agricultural waste recycling. This paper seeks to estimate households' willingness to accept compensation in terms of agricultural waste recycling adopting the contingent valuation method, and to calculate the compensation standard for households' participation in agricultural waste recycling by methods of non-parametric and parametric estimate. It aims to answer two questions: how much the compensation should be given for encouraging households to participate in agricultural waste recycling? Which factors would affect willingness to accept compensation value of households for participating in agricultural waste recycling? The results show that most households recognize the value of agricultural waste recycling and a certain amount of compensation which is about 1.08%-1.31% of average family annual income does encourage households to participate in agricultural waste recycling. Household's willingness to accept compensation and household's expected value of compensation are affected by personal or family characteristics (such as gender, household income) as well as the non-economic variables (such as environmental knowledge and environmental attitude). According to this research, reasonable compensation standard is the cornerstone of the effectiveness and efficiency of compensation policies. Household income inequality and capital allocation in terms of households' willingness to accept compensation should be taken into consideration when compensation policies about agricultural waste recycling are formulated. Environmental education for households is an effective measure to enhance their environmental consciousness, while raising the strength of government's waste management is turned out to be effective for improving the rural ecological environment. Conclusions of this study provide an important scientific basis for developing countries and regions to formulate compensation policies in terms of inspiring their agricultural waste recycling.

AB  - Background In 2019, the EAT- Lancet Commission proposed a global reference dietary pattern. Although research on the EAT- Lancet reference diet and its associations with mortality, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, dietary environmental impacts, and cost of diets is increasing, studies done in low-income and middle-income countries remain scarce. This study aimed to assess the health outcomes, environmental impacts, and dietary costs of adherence to the EAT- Lancet reference diet in China. Methods In this health and nutrition survey study, 16 029 participants from the China Health and Nutrition Survey cohort (1997-2015) were included at baseline. All-cause mortality was reported by family members and risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes was self-reported. 3-day 24 h recall was used to assess adherence to the EAT- Lancet reference diet (Eat- Lancet Diet Index [ELDI]), diet-related environmental impacts (greenhouse-gas emissions [GHGE]), total water use (TWU), land use, and dietary costs in each survey round. Hazard ratios (HRs) for the ELDI-score were obtained by Cox models with time-varying covariates, adjusted for potential confounders. Multilevel mixed-effects linear regression was used to assess the association of environmental impacts and dietary costs to the ELDI score. Findings During a median follow-up of 9<middle dot>86 years, 803 new cases of incident type 2 diabetes, 563 new cases of cardiovascular disease, and 908 cases of all-cause mortality were recorded. At baseline, the ELDI score ranged from 9<middle dot>4 points to 110<middle dot>8 points on a scale of 0 to 140, with a mean of 55<middle dot>3 points (SD 11<middle dot>8). With each SD increase in the ELDI score, there was an 8% decreased risk of mortality (95% CI 2<middle dot>2-14<middle dot>1), a 16<middle dot>1% decreased risk of cardiovascular disease (9<middle dot>2-20<middle dot>3), and a 25<middle dot>3% decreased risk of type 2 diabetes (19<middle dot>5- 28<middle dot>4). Each SD increase in the index was associated with a decrease of 2<middle dot>2% (95% CI -2<middle dot>6 to -1<middle dot>8) in GHGE, 2<middle dot>3% (-2<middle dot>6 to -2<middle dot>0) in land use, no association with TWU, but an increase in diet costs of 3<middle dot>3% (2<middle dot>8 to 3<middle dot>8). Interpretation High adherence to the ELDI was associated with a lower risk of mortality, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. However, the association with diet-related GHGE and land use was modest, and adherence was also linked to higher diet costs. The study advocates for the integration of sustainable indicators into future Chinese dietary guidelines. Additionally, policy measures such as agricultural subsidies on fruit and vegetable and carbon taxes on red meat are recommended to increase affordability, reduce environmental impact, and enhance the overall sustainability of dietary practices in China.

AB  - Individuals' food choices are typically based on recipes, not specific ingredients. This study compares almost 600 dinner recipes from the UK, the USA and Norway in terms of healthiness and environmental impact-including adherence to dietary guidelines and aggregate health indicators, as well as greenhouse gas emissions and land use. Contrary to food ingredients, little is known about recipes' healthiness or environmental impact. Here we examine 600 dinner recipes from Norway, the UK and the USA retrieved from cookbooks and the Internet. Recipe healthiness was assessed by adherence to dietary guidelines and aggregate health indicators based on front-of-pack nutrient labels, while environmental impact was assessed through greenhouse gas emissions and land use. Our results reveal that recipe healthiness strongly depends on the healthiness indicator used, with more than 70% of the recipes being classified as healthy for at least one front-of-pack label, but less than 1% comply with all dietary guidelines. All healthiness indicators correlated positively with each other and negatively with environmental impact. Recipes from the USA, found to use more red meat, have a higher environmental impact than those from Norway and the UK.

AB  - Background Organic farming is a production technique that imposes major restrictions on the use of fertilizers, pesticides, feed additives and veterinary drugs and for this reason consumers perceive organic foods to be healthier. The content of health-promoting molecules such as ascorbic acid, beta-carotene, lycopene and salicylic acid are important aspects of the nutritional quality of organic foods. Aim To evaluate health promoting substances and the heavy metal content of tomato berries grown using conventional, integrated pest management (IPM) and organic farming techniques. Methods Moisture was determined by drying, crude protein by the Kjeldhal method, and ashes by incineration at 550 degrees C. Ergosterol, ascorbic acid, beta-carotene, lycopene and salicylic acid were determined by HPLC. The levels of heavy metals were measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Results Compared to crops grown using conventional and IPM methods, organic tomatoes contained more salicylic acid but less vitamin C and lycopene. Organic tomatoes had higher Cd and Pb levels but a lower Cu content. Organic fruits had a slightly higher protein content than conventionally cultivated fruits, but the difference was minimal and consequently the nutritive significance was poor. Conclusions Farming techniques may have an impact on the quality of tomatoes. Their higher salicylate content supports the notion that organic foodstuffs are more wholesome. However, the lower lycopene and ascorbic acid levels of organic tomatoes are not to be regarded as positive. No residues of pesticides and ergosterol were detected.

AB  - This study examined the food security status of a mother at risk for child protective service involvement in Missouri. Participants were recruited through a statewide prevention program utilizing Nurturing Parenting Program for families of infants, toddlers, and preschoolers (n = 129). These mothers reported food security status over the previous year, information on community food access and quality, use of formal and informal food assistance programs, and fresh fruit and vegetable consumption. Half (51%) reported very low food security and another 25% reported low food security. Mothers also reported high use of formal food assistance programs (63%-75%), and 45% had utilized a soup kitchen or food pantry in the previous three months. Quality of food in the community was rated as poor by one in five. Very low food security was associated with decreased child consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables. Although in need of replication, the results support prevention efforts to target the lack of food as a potentially modifiable antecedent to abuse and neglect.

AB  - PurposeTo improve human health and environmental sustainability, red meat consumption should decrease and legume consumption increase in diets. More information on food motives, however, is required when developing more tailored and effective interventions targeting legume and meat consumption. We aimed to examine the associations between food motives and red meat and legume consumption, and whether these associations differ between different subgroups (gender, age groups, marital status, education, BMI).MethodsTen food motives (health, mood, convenience, sensory appeal, natural content, price-cheap, price-value, weight control, familiarity and ethical concern measured with Food Choice Questionnaire) were studied in 3079 Finnish adults in the population-based DILGOM study. Food consumption was assessed with Food Frequency Questionnaire. The adjusted estimates from multivariable regression models are reported.ResultsHigher relative importance of natural content (& beta; = - 0.275, 95% CI - 0.388; - 0.162) and ethical concern (& beta; = - 0.462, 95% CI - 0.620; - 0.305) were associated with lower red meat consumption, and higher appreciation of sensory appeal (& beta; = 0.482, 95% CI 0.347; 0.616) and price-cheap (& beta; = 0.190, 95% CI 0.099; 0.281) with higher red meat consumption. Higher importance of health (& beta; = 0.608, 95% CI 0.390; 0.825) was associated with higher legume consumption, and higher appreciation of convenience (& beta; = - 0.401, 95% CI - 0.522; - 0.279), price-value (& beta; = - 0.257, 95% CI - 0.380; - 0.133) and familiarity (& beta; = - 0.278, 95% CI - 0.393; - 0.164) with lower legume consumption. The associations of particularly ethical concern, weight control, sensory appeal and mood varied according to gender, age, marital status or BMI.ConclusionThe development and implementation of actions to decrease red meat and increase legume consumption should focus on several food motives across different subgroups.

AB  - The contributions of climate-smart agriculture to the transformation of agri-food systems as well as reducing the vulnerability of smallholder agriculture production to climate change in sub-Saharan Africa have been acknowledged in the sustainable development literature. However, studies on the impacts of adoption of climatesmart agriculture (CSA) have not thoroughly explored the impact of greenhouse technology (GHT) adoption as a CSA practice on household welfare. This study attempts to fill-in this knowledge gap by analysing the drivers of GHT adoption as well as the heterogeneous impacts of GHT adoption as CSA practice on household welfare using the marginal treatments effect (MTE) model and a unique data on greenhouse and conventional farmers from southern Ghana. The findings from the study indicate that GHT adoption as a CSA practice assisted smallholder vegetable farmers to improve their crop yields, net farm returns and per capita consumption expenditures by 21%, 15% and 13%, respectively. Further evidence from policy relevant treatment effects (PRTE) of the MTE model suggests that having access to market and climate information tend to boost GHT adoption, which consequently improve household welfare. Hence, development agencies and practitioners should make conscious efforts to accelerate the promotion of GHT as a sustainable agricultural technology that could minimize the negative effects of climate change.

AB  - Healthy insect populations are vital for maintaining natural ecosystems and essential to global food security. The ongoing dramatic loss of insect species and biomass is thus a global cause for concern, with much focus on this topic in the media. Yet, determining the mechanism behind these declines remains difficult, particularly when attempting to differentiate between anthropogenic drivers of biodiversity loss and long-term natural fluctuations. In a From the Cover manuscript in this issue of Molecular Ecology, Crossley et al. (2022) examined the long-term impact of land use change on freshwater insects by estimating levels of genetic diversity with publicly available data for the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) mitochondrial locus from >700 aquatic insect species across the United States. Contemporary genetic diversity measures reflect both current and past demography and therefore are related to both past and present habitat change. Crossley et al. found that environments with greater cropland extent over the last 200 years were associated with lower genetic diversity in contemporary aquatic insect populations. This indicates that historical land use is an important factor in contemporary population dynamics. Most critically, in regions of historical cropland cover that have been converted towards other uses (such as urban environments) more recently, aquatic insect populations exhibited higher levels of genetic diversity, indicating a possible rebound in insect populations after cessation of agricultural activity. This study highlights the power of using publicly available data to answer crucial questions regarding the current biospheric emergency.

AB  - Recent technological advancements have revolutionized agriculture in Asia, leading to significant changes in crop yield stability. This study examines the changing face of crop yield stability in Asia resulting from the increasing adoption of innovative technologies in agriculture. Through a review of current research and case studies, the impact of technology-driven changes on yield levels, variability, and predictability is explored. The study applies a yield stability index (YSI) to evaluate the yield stability of six crops in seven Asian countries during two periods (1961-1994 and 1995-2020), comparing the countries, crops, and stability changes between the two segments. The novelty of the research is the application of YSI, which, contrary to usual stability metrics, can distinguish between rare large extreme yields and frequent minor fluctuations, and based on this feature, evaluates the suitability of the prevailing technologies to local environmental conditions. The YSI is used to evaluate the stability of technologies, indicating whether the technologies can respond well to the annual variations of environmental conditions. Positive YSI values indicate stable technologies that can respond well to the annual variations of environmental conditions, and the concept of a well-technologized crop is used for crops in countries with stable positive YSI values, indicating the suitability of the actual crop to the actual geographical environment. These results can guide production technology developments and the introduction or abandonment of certain crops in certain geographical zones, especially regarding the implications of climate change and global warming. This study highlights the transformative power of technology in improving crop yield stability and food security in Asia, while discussing the potential challenges associated with these changes and the need for continued research to address them.

AB  - Ecological engineering is an agroecological approach to pest management that has been adopted by thousands of rice farmers in the Mekong Delta Region of Vietnam. Farmers adopted the intervention as part of a heuristic approach to developing the technology. This study assesses the knowledge, attitudes and practices related to ecological engineering among participating and non-participating farmers. Interviews with 315 farmers revealed a diversity of practices under the umbrella of ecological engineering, all of which were associated with the establishment of linear vegetation strips as habitat for natural enemies. As a restoring service from society to the rice ecosystem, ecological engineering incorporated significant positive-feedback loops, particularly regarding the production of supplementary foods (provisioning services) and the aesthetic value (cultural services) of planted rice bunds. Participating farmers reported fewer insecticide applications to their main rice crop; they applied insecticides at a later crop growth stage (protecting pest regulating services); and they reported higher rice yields. However, a high dependency on government support, the role of agrochemical extensionists in providing information, a tendency to apply pesticides to vegetation strips and little change in the appreciation of wildlife-related services all threaten the social sustainability of the intervention. We recommend greater attention to optimizing linear strips to not only support natural enemies but to also enhance supplementary farm incomes while reducing material and labor costs.

AB  - Food security is threatened by the global increase of human population, climate change, inequality of wealth distribution, the state of natural resources, peace and sustainability, among others. Aquaculture has become an important part of the food supply, hence contributing to food security. Sustainable fish production, which represents an important affordable protein supply, should therefore involve feed formulation and production techniques that are not dependent on fish meal as the protein source. It is on this basis that bioeconomy becomes very important to promote the resourceful use of biomass for feed, food, biomaterials, and bioenergy. This study presents housefly maggot meal as an efficient alternative protein source to fishmeal and a valuable bioresource. Clarias gariepinus fingerlings (male and female) were fed maggot meal supplemented diets for 24 weeks and we assessed their growth and gonadal development. The findings of this study revealed that maggot-meal-enhanced diets promoted growth and faster gonadal development in fish. Maggot meal represents a quality alternative protein source to fish meal and an excellent bioresource, which can help us attain sustainable aquaculture production.

AB  - Adequate diet during pregnancy has positive effects on the mother and pregnancy outcome. Assessment of diet quality during pregnancy is particularly important in areas where household food security is suboptimal, to enable appropriate targeting and intervention. This study assessed diet quality and identified predicting factors among pregnant women in northern Ghana. A cross-sectional study involving 403 pregnant women was conducted in May 2018. Pregnant women attending antenatal care clinics (ANC) were selected using simple random sampling technique. We assessed socio-demographic characteristics, 24-h recall and household food security. The minimum dietary diversity for women (MDD-W) was used as a proxy measure for diet quality based on Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) guidelines. Logistic regression models were fitted to determine the predictors of diet quality. The mean dietary diversity score (DDS) of 10 food groups was 4.4 +/- 1.1 (95% CI: 4.3-4.5). Logistic regression showed that women of high educational level (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.42; 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.21-4.84]; P = 0.01), women of high household wealth index (AOR = 1.78; 95% CI [1.14-2.77]; P = 0.01], none/mild household hunger (AOR = 2.71; 95% CI [1.26-5.82]; P = 0.01), medium household size (6-15 members) (AOR = 1.66; 95% CI [1.04-2.66]; P = 0.03) and women of gestational age 20-35 weeks (AOR = 1.89; 95% CI [1.05-3.40]; P = 0.03) were more likely to have quality diets after adjusting for potential confounding variables. Diet quality among pregnant women was low and was predicted by educational level, household wealth, gestational age and food security. Women education and improvements in household food security could impact diets of pregnant women in northern Ghana.

AB  - The COVID-19 crisis has not only increased socio-economic inequalities globally but it also severely affected people's everyday lives. This study explores the impacts of COVID-19 on household income, food security, and food consumption patterns in the urban slums of Punjab, Pakistan. Using a multistage random sampling method, cross-sectional data was collected from 257 households through face-to-face interviews. Respondents were chosen randomly applying the random walk method. The data were analysed using Probit regression models. The household food security situation was estimated using the food insecurity experience scale (HFIES) developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Results show that household income and food security situations during the COVID-19 pandemic were significantly affected by education level, household size, daily-wage earnings, salaried employment, and household income slot-I. Household participation in social safety programs appears to help mitigate income shocks and decrease food insecurity. Due to the COVID-19 crisis, 73.92% and 54.86% of the surveyed households faced income shocks and worsened food security, respectively. The consumption of meat, poultry products, and seafood decreased by 21.01%, 17.50%, and 14.39%, respectively, during the pandemic, in comparison to the pre-pandemic period. The study recommends that authorities should consider continuously focusing on supporting existing national social safety programs and designing new ones by providing responsive packages during such adversities. Further, structuring robust financial institutions to aid business recovery and to ensure the availability of food to marginalised communities, particularly in urban slums, could sustain the masses.

AB  - Relatively a few studies assess the impact of climate change (CC) policies on effective farmers' agronomic practices and associated agro-technical performance. This study aimed at characterizing how CC policies can help farmers to combine CC with other environmental issues to support the design of more effective policies at the farm level. It was conducted in Guadeloupe, where farming systems are highly vulnerable to CC. We analyzed the Agro-Environmental and Climate Measures (AECM) proposed by the European Union. We made surveys with 39 farmers and used an existing whole-farm simulation tool to assess practices promoted by the current AECM. The tool was also used to assess the new AECM under discussion by stakeholders. Structural characteristics allowed identifying various types of farms. These characteristics may affect farmers' capacity to implement the current AECM given that they are labour-intensive. New AECM focused on the decrease in pesticides and do not properly address CC since most of them lead to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and are very different from the current farmers' CC adaptation strategies. Synergies can be found between the reduction of pesticide use and CC if the alternatives proposed also permit to decrease in the use of synthetic fertilizers.

AB  - In Bangladesh, vulnerable groups including women and food security are severely impacted by climate change. Due to their lack of means for unequal climate adaptation, the impoverished and marginalized in developing countries are more exposed and vulnerable. This research study looks at how Bangladesh's food security and the status of disadvantaged women are affected by climate change. Gender-based vulnerability is rising as a result of expanding catastrophe consequences, such as decreased agricultural productivity, rising costs, joblessness, food insecurity, post-hazardous illnesses, etc., according to the literature review findings. The assessment highlights the significant risks that climate change poses to Bangladesh's food security and vulnerable women, including increased susceptibility to food shortages and post-disaster issues, given that women in Bangladesh are more susceptible to these issues due to their social, economic, and political circumstances. The literature review demonstrates that disadvantaged groups, particularly women, are negatively impacted by climate change. Profound policy implications should propose for enhancing system performance, coordinating regional agricultural output, and fortifying resistance to climate change.

AB  - The scientific revelation of the mechanism underlying land fragmentation's influence on agricultural technical efficiency is extremely important. This study utilized survey data from 305 villages across 12 provinces in Southern China in 2020 to assess technical efficiency through the application of the stochastic frontier production function. Moreover, we investigated the direct impact of land fragmentation on technical efficiency and the indirect impact transmitted through crop diversification and part-time farming by employing Tobit and mediating effect models, respectively. The key findings are as follows: (1) The sampled farmers, on average, operated 0.614 hectares of land with 17.395 plots, and the mean of their technical efficiency was 0.630. (2) The overall effect of land fragmentation on technical efficiency demonstrated a "U"-shaped relationship. (3) Crop diversification and part-time farming were mediating factors in the impact of land fragmentation on technical efficiency. Specifically, an "inverted U"-shaped relationship existed between land fragmentation and crop diversification, whereas a negative linear relationship was observed between land fragmentation and part-time farming. Conversely, crop diversification presented a positive linear relationship with technical efficiency, and part-time farming had an "inverted U"-shaped relationship with technical efficiency. (4) The impact of land fragmentation on technical efficiency varied across altitude zones. It is recommended to control land fragmentation based on local conditions, encourage crop diversification, and strengthen employment guidance and skills training for farmers to ensure the orderly transfer of land.

AB  - Food insecurity is a compelling global problem with compound causation in population expansion, industrialization of agriculture and food marketing, and environmental deterioration. The United Nations system has addressed the need for food and nutrition security from a foundation of human rights law and expressed the requirement for all people to be food secure with sustainable food systems and diets. Food biodiversity is a component of the sustainable food systems that are practiced by Indigenous Peoples living in intact ecosystems. This paper describes the evolution of the principles of food and nutrition security within the United Nations, explores current issues, and highlights a program with Indigenous Peoples' food systems that includes health promotion interventions using biodiverse local foods. Highlighted are the roles of ethnobiologists in understanding the principles and concepts underlying food and nutrition security, in promoting food biodiversity and healthy food systems, and in contributing to policies protecting food biodiversity and food and nutrition security.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between perceptions of brands advertising claims of environmental sustainability, intention to purchase such brands and the role of trust. Design/methodology/approach - Adapted scales were used to measure perceptions of price-value perception, environmental concern, brand trust and purchase intention. Relationships were tested using simple regression and structural equations modeling. Findings - The results suggest that consumers who did not report high environmental concern had high brand trust but no significant purchase intention; consumers who reported high environmental concern had significant intention to purchase green products, but negative trust in brands which were advertised with a claim to be green. Research limitations/implications - Efforts to advertise green claims may only be effective for consumers without an intention to purchase green products, and may alienate consumers who are interested in purchasing such products. Structural equations modeling was tested on a post hoc basis with a sample size that did not warrant very good fit ratios. Originality/value - The present study indicates that green claims may be misguided, and that products that have genuine green benefits may need to find alternative methods of communicating those benefits to consumers who intend to engage in sustainable consumption behavior.

AB  - Cointegration was tested between organic and conventional corn and soybean markets in several locations throughout the U.S. using a unique dataset. Organic prices were found to behave like pure jump processes rather than diffusions. A simple specification for pure jump processes is introduced and used with Monte Carlo methods to compute appropriate critical values for unit-root and cointegration tests. The findings indicate that no long-run relationship exists between organic and conventional prices, implying that price determination for organic corn and soybean is independent from that of the conventional crops. This suggests that organic corn and soybean prices are driven by demand and supply forces idiosyncratic to the organic market. For each crop, cointegrating spatial relationships are found between prices at the main organic markets. However, such relationships are generally weaker than the ones for the corresponding conventional prices, implying that organic markets are more affected by idiosyncratic shocks than conventional markets.

AB  - With the implementation of the Farm to Fork Strategy, the European Union aims to drastically reduce the use of synthetic chemical inputs and convert at least 25% of land to organic farming, which is the main alternative to the industrial/intensive production model, with many positive implications also in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.Currently, the agri-food system is facing market problems caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, with increases in production costs, prices of agricultural products and their volatility, affecting the most vulnerable actors in the supply chain, namely farmers and consumers.The objective of the paper is to analyse the effectiveness of organizational innovations in facilitating the process of converting agribusinesses to organic farming, with a focus on the supply chain, territorial coordination, and advisory services.

AB  - Conceptualized by the Food and Agriculture Organization in 2010, climate-smart agriculture aims to simultaneously tackle three main objectives. These are increasing food security, building the resilience of agricultural systems for adaptation to climate change and mitigation of GHG. As much research focuses on one of these three objectives, our understanding of how agricultural systems address these three challenges simultaneously is limited by the lack of a comprehensive evaluation tool. In order to fill this gap, we have developed a generic evaluation framework that comprises 19 indicators that we measured in a sample of 12 representative farms of the North Basse-Terre region in Guadeloupe. The evaluation revealed clear differences in the performance of these farming systems. For example, nutritional performance varied from 0 to 13 people fed per hectare, the average potential impact of climatic conditions varied from 27% to 33% and the GHG emissions balance varied from +0.8 tCO(2eq)center dot ha(-1) to +3.6 tCO(2eq)center dot ha(-1). The results obtained can guide the design of innovative production systems that better meet the objectives of climate-smart agriculture for the study region. The evaluation framework is intended as a generic tool for a common evaluation basis across regions at a larger scale. Future prospects are its application and validation in different contexts.

AB  - Increased livestock production in developing countries is seen as one way to improve world food supply. However, I the impact of increased livestock production on household health and nutrition is unknown. This paper examines linkages between commercialization of livestock production and household nutrition. Linkages include income, resource allocation, food consumption, and human disease risk. Data from Uasin Gishu district Kenya, show higher consumption of animal products for large commercialized farms along with greater control of milk spies by men. Effects of livestock development may thus differ by gender, and may include both positive and negative impacts.

AB  - In developing countries, incomplete and/or asymmetric information contributes to inefficiencies in food supply chains. Various products and services have emerged that rely on Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to facilitate information flows between agro-input providers, farmers, traders, and consumers. However, not all initiatives are equally effective and many struggle to reach scale. In this article, I review some of the earlier services that generally targeted farmers with price information to reduce search costs and increase their bargaining power vis-a-vis traders. I reflect on the reasons why these initiatives often led to disappointing results and provide examples of (complementary) interventions that look more promising. Furthermore, I highlight some of the dangers of relying too much on ICT-mediated information, such as exclusionary networks, bias in crowdsourced data, and "fake news." Finally, I explore why ICT applications that address information inefficiencies seem to be less successful than innovations that address other barriers to efficient and inclusive food supply chain development, such as risk or credit constraints.

AB  - Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is an approach to help agricultural systems worldwide, concurrently addressing three challenge areas: increased adaptation to climate change, mitigation of climate change, and ensuring global food security - through innovative policies, practices, and financing. It involves a set of objectives and multiple transformative transitions for which there are newly identified knowledge gaps. We address these questions raised by CSAwithin three areas: conceptualization, implementation, and implications for policy and decision-makers. We also draw up scenarios on the future of the CSA concept in relation to the 4 per 1000 Initiative (Soils for Food Security and Climate) launched at UNFCCC 21st Conference of the Parties (COP 21). Our analysis shows that there is still a need for further interdisciplinary research on the theoretical foundation of the CSA concept and on the necessary transformations of agriculture and land use systems. Contrasting views about implementation indicate that CSA focus on the "triple win" (adaptation, mitigation, food security) needs to be assessed in terms of science-based practices. CSA policy tools need to incorporate an integrated set of measures supported by reliable metrics. Environmental and social safeguards are necessary to make sure that CSA initiatives conform to the principles of sustainability, both at the agriculture and food system levels.

AB  - The identification of water stress is a major challenge for timely and effective irrigation to ensure global food security and sustainable agriculture. Several direct and indirect methods exist for identification of crop water stress, but they are time consuming, tedious and require highly sophisticated sensors or equipment. Image processing is one of the techniques which can help in the assessment of water stress directly. Machine learning techniques combined with image processing can aid in identifying water stress beyond the limitations of traditional image processing. Deep learning (DL) techniques have gained momentum recently for image classification and the convolutional neural network based on DL is being applied widely. In present study, comparative assessment of three DL models: AlexNet, GoogLeNet and Inception V3 are applied for identification of water stress in maize (Zea mays), okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) and soybean (Glycine max) crops. A total of 1200 digital images were acquired for each crop to form the input dataset for the deep learning models. Among the three models, performance of GoogLeNet was found to be superior with an accuracy of 98.3, 97.5 and 94.1% for maize, okra and soybean, respectively. The onset of convergence in GoogLeNet models commenced after 8 epochs with 22 (maize), 31 (okra) and 15 (soybean) iterations per epoch with error rate of less than 7.5%.

AB  - Managing agricultural environments in a way that maximises the provision of multiple ecosystem services is a significant challenge in the development of sustainable and secure food systems. Advances in network ecology provide a way forward, particularly in arable landscapes, as they incorporate mutualistic and antagonistic interactions associated with crop production. Here, we present an approach to identify mixes of non-crop plant species that provide multiple ecosystem services while minimising disservices. Genetic algorithms were applied to the Norwood Farm ecological network-a comprehensive dataset of antagonistic and mutualistic species interactions on an organic farm in the United Kingdom. We aimed to show how network analyses can be used to select plants supporting a high diversity of insect pollinators and parasitoids of insect pests, but low diversity of herbivores. Further to this, we wanted to understand the trade-offs in ecosystem service provision associated with conventional management practices that focus on individual ecosystem services. We show that multilayer network analyses can be used to identify mixes of plant species that maximise the species richness of pollinators and parasitoids (natural enemies of insect pests), while minimising the species richness of herbivores. Trade-offs between ecosystem processes were apparent with several plant species associated with a high species richness of both positive (pollinators and parasitoids) and negative (herbivores) functional taxonomic groups. As a result, optimal plant species mixes for individual ecosystem services were different from the mix simultaneously maximising pollination and parasitism of pest insects, while minimising herbivory. Synthesis and applications. Plant mixes designed solely for maximising pollinator species richness are not optimal for the provision of other ecosystem services and disservices (e.g. parasitism of insect pests and herbivory). The method presented here will allow for the design of management strategies that facilitate the provision of multiple ecosystem services. To this end, we provide a protocol for practitioners to develop their own plant mixes suitable for farm-scale management. This avenue of predictive network ecology has the potential to enhance agricultural management, supporting high levels of biodiversity and food production by manipulating ecological networks in specific ways.

AB  - Growing concern over food security has drawn worldwide scholarly attention. Addressing food security issues highlights the vulnerability of agricultural yield to the complexity of agriculture inputs. Therefore, this study considers the intricacies of cultivation inputs and their effect on cereal production across 20 developing Asian countries from 1990 to 2022. First, advanced machine learning algorithms are employed to investigate the combined impact of the farming Product Complexity Index on agricultural yields. Second, the Granger causality test was used to uncover the causality direction between agricultural yield and exogenous variables. Both the causal inference neural network (CINN) and deep neural network (DNN) models show a rapid initial decrease in loss during the early epochs, followed by a more gradual decline, indicating effective learning and convergence. Notably, the CINN model consistently starts with a lower loss compared to the DNN model, suggesting superior performance in minimizing the training loss. These machine learning techniques have successfully predicted the synergistic relationships, leading to significant improvements in cereal yield forecasting. The Granger causality results revealed feedback causality between the agricultural Product Complexity Index and crop yields and the use of fertilizer and agricultural yields on different lags. These results emphasize the potential for targeted guidelines that harness the interactions between complexities in agriculture and the application of fertilizer to improve cereal yields.

AB  - This review paper synthesizes the current understanding of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from field cropping systems. It examines the key factors influencing GHG emissions, including crop type, management practices, and soil conditions. The review highlights the variability in GHG emissions across different cropping systems. Conventional tillage systems generally emit higher levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) than no-till or reduced tillage systems. Crop rotation, cover cropping, and residue management can significantly reduce GHG emissions by improving soil carbon sequestration and reducing nitrogen fertilizer requirements. The paper also discusses the challenges and opportunities for mitigating GHG emissions in field cropping systems. Precision agriculture techniques, such as variable rate application of fertilizers and water, can optimize crop production while minimizing environmental impacts. Agroforestry systems, which integrate trees and crops, offer the potential for carbon sequestration and reducing N2O emissions. This review provides insights into the latest research on GHG emissions from field cropping systems and identifies areas for further study. It emphasizes the importance of adopting sustainable management practices to reduce GHG emissions and enhance the environmental sustainability of agricultural systems.

AB  - Rice (Oryza saliva L.), is the staple food for more than half of the world population and an important target to secure food security and livelihoods for millions. The production of rice to mitigate the consumption requirement needs huge amount of water. Direct seeded rice (DSR) technique is becoming popular nowadays because of its low-input demands and potential to maximize the water productivity under deficit soil moisture. Rice variety, Pusa 1121 is important variety in major rice growing areas of Indo Gangetic Plain that occupies more than 70% area. The population of planthoppers and stem borers were significantly higher and appeared early in direct seeding crop as compared with transplanted rice (TPR). The mean seasonal incidence of stem borers in 2014 were 9.58 and 5.29% in direct seeding whereas in 2015 it was 9.36 and 4.97%. The damage (white ears) was observed maximum on 42nd week in October. The result revealed that incidence of leaffolder was significantly higher in direct seeding than transplanting. The population/ incidence of pests showed positively significant correlation with biotic factors during the study. The grain yield in transplanting crop was also significantly higher than direct seeding. So, management practices in direct seeding should be practiced earlier as compared to transplanted rice to maximize yield by reducing pest population pressure for sustainable agriculture and to conserve natural resources.

AB  - The productivist model implemented after the second world war has succeeded in improving production to meet growing demands for food, but it has also deeply affected soil physicochemical properties, as well as of aboveground and belowground biodiversity. Alternative farming systems such as organic farming, biodynamic farming and soil conservation farming are actually developing to enhance the sustainability of farming systems. Although the impact of agricultural practices on soil ecological quality is well known, there is little knowledge on the impact of the different farming systems as a whole. Here, we analysed the impact of the main farming systems on soil biodiversity and functioning, reported in about 100 scientific publications. We found that conventional, organic, and biodynamic systems are the most widely studied, whereas soil conservation farming is poorly documented. Soil biological indicators are improved by ca. 70% in organic farming and biodynamic farming relative to conventional farming. 43% of soil bioindicators are improved in biodynamic farming relatively to organic farming. Soil conservation farming scores better than conventional farming for 57% of the indicators. Therefore, biodynamic farming displays the highest soil ecological quality, followed by organic farming, soil conservation farming and, last, conventional farming. Organic fertilisation and longer crop rotations are the most favourable practices, whereas pesticides and soil tillage are the most deleterious ones. The review also evidences a lack of studies on soil conservation farming and on bioindicators of the soil fauna.

AB  - The establishment of Forest Management Units (Kesatuan Pengelolaan Hutan/ KPH) represents one of Indonesia's most significant forest governance reforms, covering the 120 million hectares of designated Forest Areas. Sharing features with the Landscape Approach, KPHs are expected to reduce deforestation and forest degradation through improved forest planning, oversight, open access avoidance, and fire prevention and response. This paper assesses the impact of KPHs on the reduction of forest loss, including forest loss due to fire, and the factors that influence this impact (e.g. KPH's primary objective, deforestation risk). We use remotely sensed data to estimate difference-in-differences models accounting for differences in baseline characteristics and multiple time periods. Our case study, Sulawesi Island, is primarily shaped by smallholder farmer land use, where KPHs can exert significant influence. We do not find evidence of an overall effect of KPHs on deforestation. However, we observe intriguing heterogeneous effects depending on the year, including significantly less deforestation in already-established KPHs during the El Nino years of 2015-16, and a notable impact on the reduction of forest loss due to fire in some early-established KPHs. These findings warrant further investigation.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the causal relationship between technological innovation and sheep farm's results, based on a Structural Equation Modeling Approach (SEM) in dairy sheep systems in the center of Spain. Different from traditional multiple-trait models, SEM analysis allows assessment of potential causal interrelationships among outcomes and can effectively discriminate effects. Information from 157 dairy sheep farms in Castilla La Mancha was used. The questionnaires included 38 technological innovations and 188 questions on productive, economic and social data. Four hypotheses were formulated oriented to understand how the farm's technological innovation will affect the productive structure and farm's performance. The results derived from the SEM analysis showed a positive relationship between the technological indicator and the farm's structure, productivity, and economic results. The variable technological adoption could be regarded as a predictable measure of structure, productivity, and economic performance. Technology is associated with the productive structure. Independent of sheep farms' size, dairy sheep farms can be positioned in the growing returns area as a consequence of a proper use of it. SEM approach to observational data in the context of dairy sheep system suggests that there is not a single optimal structure. The model built constitutes a tool of great utility to make decisions, as it allows predicting the impact of technologies on final results ex-ante.

AB  - Land-cover degradation affects the ability of forests to provide water ecosystem services (ESw). This study explores the forest-water nexus and provides an overview of the water management related to potential hy-drological impacts of land-use and land-cover change in the Rio Grande de Comitan-Lagos de Montebello watershed in southeastern Mexico. A combination of methods recommended by the Toolkit for Ecosystem Service Site-based Assessment (TESSA), as well as scenario modelling based on an ecological index of riparian quality, were used to assess how alternative reforestation or deforestation scenarios can affect water provision and water quality at different scales. The results indicate that water quality is positively related to forest cover. The effects of terrain and forest-cover conditions on fog inputs and actual evapotranspiration were relevant to increase the water yield under reforestation scenarios. However, strategies for improving the efficient consumption of both green and blue water resources must be considered at a local scale. Deteriorated ESw are also related to inadequate management of water resources in the study area, so water security for local populations requires land use policies that should consider forest-based solutions, sustainable agricultural practices, and the development of efficient distribution networks for water.

AB  - Mineral carbonation is a promising strategy for mitigating carbon emissions and combating climate change. This study investigates the efficacy and sustainability of MgO-based stabilization techniques for soft marine soils, incorporating supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) such as biochar and slag. A combination of laboratory experiments and rigorous analyses was utilized to elucidate the complex interplay between the additives and their impacts on soil hydraulic characteristics, carbon sequestration potential, embodied energy, and economic viability. Mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) was employed to characterize pore structure changes induced by carbonation, while X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to correlate mineral formations. The results indicate that MgO-biochar-treated soils exhibit enhanced soil air content, pore connectivity, and carbon sequestration efficiency compared to MgO-slag-treated soils, exhibiting reduced pore volumes and limited CO2 diffusion. Integrating biochar with MgO enhanced brucite and nesquehonite precipitation due to biochar's porous structure and functionalized surface area, facilitating gas diffusion and nucleation for mineral formation. Sustainability assessments highlight the environmental and economic trade-offs, positioning MgO-biochar and MgO-slag combinations as cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternatives. This research provides theoretical guidance for sustainable soil stabilization and efficient CO2 mineralization, offering valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers addressing climate change challenges. MgO-based binders enhance soil stability and CO2 sequestration. This study examines soft dredged marine soils treated with MgO, integrated with biochar or slag, demonstrating significant improvements in soil properties and environmental benefits.

AB  - Food prescription programs (Food Rx) have the potential to improve management of diet-related chronic diseases or underlying conditions such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, and high body mass index (BMI) among food-insecure patients. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a Food Rx program implemented in two community-based clinics in Florida. Data were collected through researcher-administered surveys (food insecurity, demographics, and socio-economic variables) and biometric data (HbA1c, blood pressure, and BMI). Key results include the following: (1) Hispanic patients are more likely to utilize the program than their Black and White counterparts (p < 0.001); (2) older patients (>= 50 years) have a higher food redemption rate when compared to younger patients (36-49.9 years); (3) food redemption rate is negatively associated with food security scores indicating improvements in food security status over time (r(2) = -0.184, p = 0.036); (4) diabetic patients with higher baseline HbA1c (>9%) have significant reductions in glycated hemoglobin (p = 0.011) over time as compared to patients with lower baseline values (<7%); and (5) patients enrolled in the program for at least 6 months have a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (p = 0.051). Changes in BMI were not significantly associated with redemption rates. This study is significant as it offers insights into the potential benefits and challenges of implementing Food Rx programs to address diet-related chronic diseases among underserved populations.

AB  - Food systems are plagued by the grand sustainability challenge of food waste, which represents a urging issue from economic, environmental and social point of view. dThe Circular Economy paradigm can open up different actions which are framed within the so-called Food Waste Hierarchy (FWH). In these regards, scholars recommend to leverage on those practices that are able to prevent the generation of surplus food, preserving a higher share of the sustainable value. For these pre-harvest and post-harvest practices that go under the name of prevention or reuse strategies in different FWH, technology plays a crucial role. Through a set of 34 semi-structured interviews with technology providers as well as with companies in the agri-food supply chain, the present work investigates extensively the range of the available technologies and the detailed objectives of such technologies for food loss and waste prevention (i.e., fore-casting, monitoring, grouping, shelf life extension, product quality and value upgrading). Moreover, different forms of collaboration enable to reach these objectives in different ways. Collaboration with technology providers can be based on continuous technical assistance and consulting for data elaboration and data analysis as well as on full data sharing and co-design, allowing to achieve a different impact on food loss and waste prevention. Finally, our study reveals that the adoption of different technological options can represent the engine to establish vertical collaborations between the adopter of the technology and another stage in the agri-food supply chain, in order to fight food waste and loss with a coordinated supply chain effort.

AB  - Land-use change can have significant impacts on soil and aboveground carbon (C) stocks and there is a clear need to identify sustainable land uses which maximize C mitigation potential. Land-use transitions from agricultural to bioenergy crops are increasingly common in Europe with one option being Short Rotation Forestry (SRF). Research on the impact on C stocks of the establishment of SRF is limited, but given the potential for this bioenergy crop in temperate climates, there is an evident knowledge gap. Here, we examine changes in soil C stock following the establishment of SRF using combined short (30cm depth) and deep (1m depth) soil cores at 11 sites representing 29 transitions from agriculture to SRF. We compare the effects of tree species including 9 coniferous, 16 broadleaved and 4 Eucalyptus transitions. SRF aboveground and root biomass were also estimated in 15 of the transitions using tree mensuration data allowing assessments of changes in total ecosystem C stock. Planting coniferous SRF, compared to broadleaved and Eucalyptus SRF, resulted in greater accumulation of litter and overall increased soil C stock relative to agricultural controls. Though broadleaved SRF had no overall effect on soil C stock, it showed the most variable response suggesting species-specific effects and interactions with soil types. While Eucalyptus transitions induced a reduction in soil C stocks, this was not significant unless considered on a soil mass basis. Given the relatively young age and limited number of Eucalyptus plantations, it is not possible to say whether this reduction will persist in older stands. Combining estimates of C stocks from different ecosystem components (e.g., soil, aboveground biomass) reinforced the accumulation of C under coniferous SRF, and indicates generally positive effects of SRF on whole-ecosystem C. These results fill an important knowledge gap and provide data for modelling of future scenarios of LUC.

This investigation is basedResults: Analysis of soil fertility parameters data of last 15 years indicated positive trends of change in soil pH (7.7 to 7.4), organic carbon (4.0 to 5.4 g kg ) and-1 available P (9.9 to 15.4 mg kg ). These-1 changes are very much synchronised with increase in average rice-wheat yield trend (7.99 to 9.38 t ha ) in the State of Punjab.-1 Intensive cultivation also helped in higher soil carbon sequestration (3.73 t ha-1).Interpretation: improved soil fertility/health, including increased soil carbon sequestration in the Indian Punjab. The long-term trends of change in different soil fertility parameters will help to regulate the fertilizers usage to sustain the soil health as well as crop yields in this region.

AB  - A growing world population with increasing levels of food consumption will lead to more dairy and swine production and increasing amount of manure that requires treatment. Discharge of excessive nutrients and carbon in untreated animal manure can lead to greenhouse gas emissions and eutrophication concerns, and treatment efforts can be expensive for small scale farmers in marginalized communities. The overall goal of this study was to determine the environmental and economic sustainability of four animal manure management scenarios in Costa Rica: (1) no treatment, (2) biodigesters, (3) biodigesters and struvite precipitation, and (4) biodigesters, struvite precipitation, and lagoons. Life cycle assessment was used to assess the carbon footprint and eutrophication potential, whereas life cycle cost analysis was used to evaluate the equivalent uniform annual worth over the construction and operation and maintenance life stages. Recovery of biogas as a cooking fuel and recovery of nutrients from the struvite reactor reduced the carbon footprint, leading to carbon offsets of up to 2,500 kg CO2 eq/year. Offsets were primarily due to avoiding methane emissions during energy recovery. Eutrophication potential decreased as resource recovery processes were integrated, primarily due to improved removal of phosphorus in effluent waters. Resource recovery efforts led to equivalent uniform annual benefits of $825 to $1,056/year, which could provide a helpful revenue source for lower-income farmers. This research can provide clarity on how small-scale farmers in marginalized settings can utilize resource recovery technologies to better manage animal manure, while improving economic and environmental sustainability outcomes.

AB  - Degraded hillsides in Northern Pakistan are rehabilitated through social forestry campaigns using fast growing exotic trees. These plantations on former scrublands curtail access by livestock owned by landless pastoralists and create social tension. This study proposes an alternative strategy of planting indigenous fodder trees and shrubs that are well-suited to the local socio-ecological characteristics and can benefit all social segments. The choice of fodder tree species, their nutritional value and distribution within the complex socio-ecological system is explained. This study also explores the suitability of these trees at different elevations, sites and transhumant routes. Providing mobile herders with adequate fodder trees could relax social tensions and complement food security.

AB  - The authors show increased negative extremes in gross primary productivity in northern midlatitude ecosystems, particularly over grasslands and croplands, attributed to impacts of warm droughts. This highlights the vulnerability of terrestrial carbon sinks and food security to increasing extreme events. Climate extremes such as droughts and heatwaves have a large impact on terrestrial carbon uptake by reducing gross primary production (GPP). While the evidence for increasing frequency and intensity of climate extremes over the last decades is growing, potential systematic adverse shifts in GPP have not been assessed. Using observationally-constrained and process-based model data, we estimate that particularly northern midlatitude ecosystems experienced a +10.6% increase in negative GPP extremes in the period 2000-2016 compared to 1982-1998. We attribute this increase predominantly to a greater impact of warm droughts, in particular over northern temperate grasslands (+95.0% corresponding mean increase) and croplands (+84.0%), in and after the peak growing season. These results highlight the growing vulnerability of ecosystem productivity to warm droughts, implying increased adverse impacts of these climate extremes on terrestrial carbon sinks as well as a rising pressure on global food security.

AB  - Organic farming is expected to contribute to conserving national biodiversity on farms, especially remnant, old, and undisturbed small biotopes, forests, and permanent grassland. This objective cannot rely on the legislation of organic farming solely, and to succeed, farmers need to understand the goals behind it. A set of indicators with the purpose of facilitating dialogues between expert and farmer on wildlife quality has been developed and tested on eight organic farms. "Weed cover in cereal fields," was used as an indicator of floral and faunal biodiversity in the cultivated land, and "uncultivated biotope area" on the farm was used as a general measure of wildlife habitats. Functional grouping of herbaceous plants (discriminating between "high conservation value" plant species and "competitive"/"ruderal" species) and low mobility butterflies were used as indicators of conservation value, especially focusing on the few sites left with considerable remnant conservation value. The dialog processes revealed that the organic farmers' ideas and goals of conservation of wildlife quality were not necessarily the same as for biologists; the farmers expressed very different opinions on the biological rooted idea, that wildlife quality is related to the absence of agricultural impact. However, farmers also stated that the information given by the indicators and especially the dialogue with the biologist had influenced their perception and awareness of wildlife. We conclude that, combined with a dialogue process, using these indicators when mapping wildlife quality could be an important key component of a farm wildlife management advisory tool at farm level.

AB  - To ensure long-term food production in a changing world, it is critical to identify field management practices that increase crop yields and maintain soil health. Additionally, sustainable agriculture needs to provide experimental evidence to support the use of traditional agricultural practices. In this study, a 20-year investigation of the effects of different combinations of fertilizer types (control, chemical fertilizer, organic fertilizer, and bio-fertilizer) and fertilization amount (conventional dosages and high dosages) on wheat yield and soil health, including soil enzyme activity and microbial biomass, soil microbial diversity, and crop yield. Our long-term study indicates that the use of high dosages of bio-fertilizer can increase the fertilizer yield contribution rate by a minimum of 76.7% compared to other management combinations. Furthermore, this practice can improve soil biological quality, including the concentration of soil microbial biomass carbon, promote bacterial biodiversity, and enhance the soil health index. The effect of high dosages fertilizer was greater than that of conventional dosages fertilizer. The highest soil health index was 0.88 in high dosage bio-fertilizer, and the lowest was 0.12 in chemical fertilizer. In summary, these results suggested that the use of bio-fertilizer can help maintain soil health and crop productivity in the long term.

AB  - Smart packaging provides one possible solution that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In comparison with traditional packaging, which aims to extend the product's useful life and to facilitate transport and marketing, smart packaging allows increased efficiency, for example by ensuring authenticity and traceability from the product's origin, preventing fraud and theft, and improving security. Consequently, it may help to reduce pollution, food losses, and waste associated with the food supply chain. However, some questions must be answered to fully understand the advantages and limitations of its use. What are the most suitable smart packaging technologies for use in agro-industrial subsectors such as meat, dairy, fruits, and vegetables, bakery, and pastry? What are the opportunities from a perspective of life extension, process optimization, traceability, product quality, and safety? What are the future challenges? An up-to-date, systematic review was conducted of literature relevant to the application of indicator technologies, sensors, and data carriers in smart packaging, to answer these questions.

AB  - As a dynamic process in the soil, soil aggregation has a direct impact on several vital functions, including microbial activity, greenhouse gas emissions, water storage, and nutrient availability. Biochar as a recalcitrant soil amendment could potentially regulate soil functions, especially aggregation. However, there have been conflicting studies regarding the effectiveness of biochar, its variations, and how it interacts with various soil conditions to affect aggregate status. In this regard a thorough meta-analysis was conducted, considering six categories of significant variables: soil texture, soil organic carbon (SOC), application rate, pyrolysis temperature, feedstock type, and various biochar use methodologies as well as various soil aggregation indices as impacted factors. Based on the results, wood-based biochar showed the highest efficiency above straw and manure-based biochar with a positive effect size of 15.4 % and 17.7 % for mean weight diameter (MWD) and macro-aggregate. The highest geometric mean diameter (GMD) was obtained from biochars pyrolyzed at 550< degrees C with 19.9 % effect size. Also, low pyrolysis temperature (<450 degrees C) resulted in the maximum formation of micro-aggregates with a positive effect size of 14.9 %. The moderate application of biochar (10-20 t ha- 1) resulted in the lowest micro-aggregates (-8.9 %) and the highest macro-aggregates (24.2 %). The single application of biochar resulted in a positive effect size in the case of macro-aggregate (17.2 %) significantly higher than the combined application of biochar with fertilizer (8.1 %). The highest MWD (12.8 %) and GMD (7.1 %) were obtained from biochar-treated soils with loamy texture. Also, the high availability of SOC (2<%) caused the highest macro-aggregate formation with a positive effect size of 28.2 %. Expanding our knowledge of biochar capability and soil functions could change soil aggregation scenarios, as the variety of biochar pyrolysis processes and its application strategies could directly modify soil's dynamic structure, through inducing functional groups, carbon linkage, and soil particle rearrangement.

AB  - Ensuring higher productivity and profitability, gainful employment and adequate supply of food, feed, fodder and fiber for a growing human and livestock population, along with maintaining environmental sustainability are major challenges in agricultural production systems of arid and semi-arid regions. Integrated farming systems (IFS) comprising of many agri-innovations have the potential to meet such requirements. An association of individual and interdependent components of farming on a given piece of land, taking cognizance of available natural resources and the differential requirement of a wide range of farming community, remains the guiding principle of IFS. Research conducted across arid and semi-arid regions is reviewed here in order to understand the role of IFS in enhancing production, income and livelihood; minimizing risk associated with farming in arid and drier semi-arid regions; utilizing and conserving the resources; and in enhancing mitigation and adaptation to climate change. It has been conclusively established that IFS involving integration of different enterprises (crop, livestock, horticulture, forestry, poultry and fish) enhanced productivity, profitability, resource use efficiency, generated more employment and minimized resources degradation and risks. IFS, therefore, could be a key form of farming intensification needed for achieving future food security and environmental sustainability in arid and semi-arid regions. Promoting adoption of the location-specific IFS in future is linked directly with coherent policy, institutional commitment, infrastructure development, better coordination among different agricultural and rural development programme and agencies, and a stimulus package of incentives. The relevance of IFS in adaptation to and mitigation of climate change is also discussed.

AB  - A decision-aiding methodology for agricultural groundwater management is presented; it is based on the combination of a watershed model, a groundwater flow model, and an optimization model. This methodology was applied to an agricultural watershed in northeastern Greece. The watershed model used was the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), which provided recharge rates for the aquifers. These recharge rates were imported in the well-known MODFLOW groundwater flow model. Both models were calibrated and verified using field data. Then, the nonlinear optimization problem was solved by a piecewise linearization process, in which the Simplex algorithm was applied sequentially. Apart from several pumping and climate change sensitivity scenarios, a land use change scenario and a climate change scenario, combining the three models, were tested, showing the ability of this methodology to be used in the decision-making process.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Farmers are faced with a wide range of pest management (PM) options that can be adopted in isolation or alongside complementary or substitute strategies. This paper presents the results of a survey of UK cereal producers, focusing on the character and diversity of PM strategies currently used by, or available to, farmers. In addition, the survey asked various questions pertaining to agricultural policy participation, attitude towards environmental issues, sources of PM advice and information and the important characteristics of PM technologies. RESULTS: The results indicate that many farmers do make use of a suite of PM techniques, and that their choice of integrated PM (IPM) portfolio appears to be jointly dictated by farm characteristics and government policy. Results also indicate that portfolio choice does affect the number of subsequent insecticide applications per crop. CONCLUSIONS: These results help to identify the type of IPM portfolios considered to be adoptable by farmers and highlight the importance of substitution in IPM portfolios. As such, these results will help to direct R&D effort towards the realisation of more sustainable PM approaches and aid the identification of potential portfolio adopters. These findings highlight the opportunity that a revised agri-environmental policy design could generate in terms of enhancing coherent IPM portfolio adoption. (C) 2009 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - As global agricultural systems face increasing challenges from pest pressures and environmental degradation, a paradigm shift towards more sustainable and resilient practices is imperative. The field of biosecurity, encompassing strategic and integrated approaches to managing risks to human, other animal, and plant life, has gained prominence as globalization facilitates the movement and spread of invasive species. This paper presents a comprehensive biosecurity framework that seamlessly integrates integrated pest management (IPM) strategies with sustainability principles to enhance the effectiveness of pest control strategies. By combining proactive and preventive measures, biosecurity practices, and IPM methodologies, we can create a holistic approach to safeguarding ecosystems, agriculture, and public health. This review outlines the key components of the biosecurity framework, benefits, challenges, and practical applications of incorporating IPM into biosecurity measures. A medida que los sistemas agr & iacute;colas globales enfrentan desaf & iacute;os cada vez mayores debido a la presi & oacute;n de las plagas y la degradaci & oacute;n ambiental, es imperativo un cambio de paradigma hacia pr & aacute;cticas m & aacute;s sostenibles y resilientes.

AB  - In agricultural production systems with shade trees, such as coffee, the increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from production intensification can be compensated for, or even outweighed, by the increase in carbon sequestration into above-ground and below-ground tree biomass. We use data from a long-term coffee agroforestry experiment in Costa Rica to evaluate the trade-offs between intensification, profitability and net greenhouse gas emissions through two scenarios. First, by assessing the GHG emissions associated with conversion from shaded to more profitable full-sun (un-shaded) systems, we calculate the break-even carbon price which would need to be paid to offset the opportunity cost of not converting. The price per tCO(2)e of emissions reduction required to compensate for the coffee production revenue foregone varies widely from 9.3 to 196.3 US$ amongst different shaded systems. Second, as an alternative to intensification, production area can be extended onto currently forested land. We estimate this land-use change required to compensate for the shortfall in profitability from retaining lower intensity coffee production systems. For four of the five shade types tested, this land-use change causes additional GHG emissions >5 tCO(2)e ha(-1) yr(-1) resulting in net emissions >8 tCO(2)e ha(-1) yr(-1) for the whole system. We conclude that instead, by intensifying production, mechanisms similar to REDD that are based on reducing emissions through avoided land-use change (REAL) could play a major role in increasing the climate change mitigation success of agroforestry systems at the same time as aiding REDD through reducing pressure for further forest conversion to agriculture.

AB  - The challenge of feeding the current and future world population is widely recognized, and the management of plant diseases has an important role in overcoming this. This paper explores the ways in which international plant pathology has contributed and continues to support efforts to secure adequate, safe and culturally appropriate nourishment and livelihoods for present and future generations. For the purposes of this paper, "international plant pathology" refers to the work that plant pathologists do when they work across international borders, with a focus on enhancing food security in tropical regions. Significant efforts involve public and philanthropic resources from the global North for addressing plant disease concerns in the global South, where food security is a legitimate and pressing concern. International disease management efforts are also aimed at protecting domestic food security, for example when pathogens of major staples migrate across national borders. In addition, some important crops are largely produced in tropical countries and consumed globally, including in industrialized countries; the diseases of these crops are of international interest, and they are largely managed by the private sector. Finally, host-microbe interactions are fascinating biological systems, and basic research on plant diseases of international relevance has often yielded insights and technologies with both scientific and practical implications.

AB  - The interplay between nitrogen fertilization (N), yield, nitrous oxide emissions (N2O), and diesel fuel utilization associated with harvest and transport logistics of biomass crops remains poorly understood. In this research, we show that intensification (in terms of N) of bioenergy cropping to maximize yield supports not only minimized land use but also maximized logistics efficiency in terms of diesel use. This paradigm was examined within the scope of the billion-ton biofuels vision and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 using potential yields on marginal and prime agricultural land. Sixteen scenarios were investigated that considered the primary factors with agriculture bioenergy; biomass yield (11.2 and 22.4 Mgha(-1)yr(-1)), two nitrogen fertilizer application rates (50 and 100kg N ha(-1)yr(-1)), two Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHGE) factors for synthetic nitrogen to nitrous oxide (1.5 and 5%), and three harvest/transportation efficiencies (50, 65, and 80%). These scenarios resulted in energy consumption between 747 and 1351 MJ Mg-1 and GHGE between 72 and 311 kg CO2 eq Mg-1. GHGE emissions are strongly related to the emission of nitrous oxide from soils due to nitrogen fertilization and could represent over 80% of the GHGE relative to biomass harvest logistics. These data imply that synthetic N supplementation to maximize yield could reduce the burden due to diesel fuel for harvest, but would rapidly become the most significant contributor to GHGE. Minimizing the impact of N fertilization will be critical for reducing the GHGE associated with biomass production.

AB  - As part of a themed section, this introductory paper provides critical insights into important social science debates associated with food security and animal/plant diseases. Continued volatility in the price of basic foodstuffs on international commodity markets has ensured that food security will be one of the 'master frames' of early twentieth century public policy. While increasing food production through 'sustainable intensification' characterises the essentially scientific solution to food (in)security issues, other 'framings' of food security are also important. These include providing access to affordable and good quality food, reducing food waste and encouraging more urban-based agriculture. Animal/plant diseases are a considerable threat to food security because of growing trade, travel, transport and tourism. A range of national/international and scientific control measures help to reduce the risk of disease spread, but micro-scale studies are needed to help understand the practicalities of applying biosecurity controls at local geographical scales.

AB  - Proper nourishment is fundamental for satisfactory crop growth and production. However, for efficient crop production, it is important to understand the soil environment, to recognize the limitations of that environment, and to ameliorate them where possible without damaging the soil quality. Soil testing and fertilizer recommendation facilities (STFRF) can help farmers to achieve environmental and economic sustainability by assisting them in recognizing their soil condition, reducing agrochemicals usage, using an appropriate amount of fertilizer, minimizing input costs, and achieving higher yield. These facilities are not new in the context of Bangladesh, yet the adoption rate among farmers is low and its determinants have rarely been empirically tested based on microlevel data. Therefore, this study examined those factors underlying the adoption of soil testing and fertilizer recommendation facilities using field surveyed data of 176 individual farmers. Our evidence shows that young farmers with less farming experience are more likely to adopt these facilities. Additionally, being small-scale farmers, having higher education, having more farming income, and having more knowledge about these facilities and the fees of these facilities were found to have a significant effect on the adoption. On the other hand, gender, land ownership, and secondary income were found to be insignificant with regard to the adoption of soil testing and fertilizer recommendation facilities. Our results also revealed that most adopter farmers not only focused on profitability, but were additionally concerned with environmental well-being.

AB  - Food loss is one of the significant threats to sustainable development. Although various studies investigating food loss drivers disclosed that logistics is a significant reason for food loss, logistics-related food loss drivers have not been thoroughly studied. Thus, this paper aims to identify, classify and rank the logistics-related food loss drivers, having more influence on the amount of food loss in the fruit and vegetable supply chain, with the help of a mixed-method approach. First, a literature review was conducted to identify potential logistics-related food loss drivers. A total of 49 articles were analyzed. Second, 21 semi-structured interviews were conducted with industry experts to finalize the drivers. Third, the analytical hierarchy process was employed to rank the drivers having more influence on the amount of food loss. Five main drivers and nineteen sub-drivers were identified at the end of the literature review and interview process. Categorization of main drivers is based on the logistics activities. According to results, warehousing-related drivers and transportation-related drivers are the two most influential drivers on the amount of food loss, while lack of coordination and improper packaging material are the two most influential sub-drivers. Following the ranking of drivers and sub-drivers, mitigation strategies to diminish food loss are also discussed. The findings of this study are intended to guide fruit and vegetable supply chain actors in tackling food loss.

AB  - Conservation tillage covers a range of tillage practices, mostly non-inversion, which aim to conserve soil moisture and reduce soil erosion by leaving more than one-third of the soil surface covered by crop residues. Organic farmers are encouraged to adopt conservation tillage to preserve soil quality and fertility and to prevent soil degradation - mainly erosion and compaction. The potential advantages of conservation tillage in organic farming are reduced erosion, greater macroporosity in the soil surface due to larger number of earthworms, more microbial activity and carbon storage, less run-off and leaching of nutrients, reduced fuel use and faster tillage. The disadvantages of conservation tillage in organic farming are greater pressure from grass weeds, less suitable than ploughing for poorly drained, unstable soils or high rainfall areas, restricted N availability and restricted crop choice. The success of conservation tillage in organic farming hinges on the choice of crop rotation to ensure weed and disease control and nitrogen availability. Rotation of tillage depth according to crop type, in conjunction with compaction control measures is also required. A high standard of management is required, tailored to local soil and site conditions. Innovative approaches for the application of conservation tillage, such as perennial mulches, mechanical control of cover crops, rotational tillage and controlled traffic, require further practical assessment.

AB  - The world food supply has become dependent on synthetic fertilizer from ammonia, which comes from the Haber-Bosch process. This process consumes large amounts of fossil fuels and releases large amounts of greenhouse gases. The excessive use of synthetic fixed nitrogen fertilizers has led to severe environmental effects, but fixed nitrogen is essential to the sustainability of biofuels. Nitrogen fertilizers are also required for biotic carbon capture schemes like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), afforestation, and soil carbon sequestration. Ammonia has been proposed as a non-carbon emitting alternative fuel that has many advantages over hydrogen. Organic agriculture and nitrogen recovery from waste streams may only partially reduce the demand for synthetic fixed nitrogen. Social solutions like population stabilization may be the best solution for the food supply problem, but ammonia is an enabling technology for alternative fuels and carbon sequestration. Alternative processes for nitrogen fixation are very early in development. This paper offers the viewpoint that alternative means of nitrogen fixation and the wise use of fixed nitrogen need to be developed quickly.

AB  - Global environmental change affects the intensity and frequency of rainfall that increases the necessity for sustainable management of rainwater. It is more important for rain intensive country like Bangladesh otherwise it creates further problems like water logging, flood, soil erosion, and water borne diseases. Based on the survey of 80 rainwater harvesters in the Coastal Bangladesh in 2017, this paper evaluates whether rainwater harvesting is sustainable approach to govern rainwater or not by using social and ecological performance measures of Social Ecological System (SES) of Elinor Ostrom. This study found that rainwater harvesting does not affect environment, it is an acceptable approach in family and society, help to develop biodiversity condition, create resilience to climate change impact, improve equitable access to water, efficient use of rainwater, improve women performance regarding water supply to the family, contribute in achieving sustainable development goal, and do not overharvest of rainwater that could create environmental problem. Beyond these measures, it needs rainwater harvesting controlling mechanism like formal operation rule or policy to avoid overharvesting and ensure more sustainability in governing rainwater.

AB  - Rice is a staple food for a significant portion of the global population, making accurate classification of rice varieties essential for farming and consumer protection. This review provides a focused analysis of the current advancements and challenges in applying computer vision (CV) techniques to rice variety classification. The study examines key steps in the automation process, including image acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms, with particular emphasis on machine learning and deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which have demonstrated exceptional performance in recent research. However, practical implementation faces challenges, including the availability of high-quality datasets, the impact of environmental variations on image quality, and the computational demands of complex models. Our study discusses these obstacles and highlights the importance of developing resilient and scalable systems for real-world applications. By synthesizing findings from various studies, this review proposes future directions for advancing rice variety classification, focusing on improved feature extraction techniques, enhanced dataset management, and integrating innovative machine learning paradigms. This work is a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners aiming to advance rice classification technologies and contribute to food security and agricultural sustainability.

AB  - Background: This study integrates the diffusion of innovation, technology acceptance model and Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory to assess the role that information and communications technology (ICT) plays in ensuring food security. A survey of smallholder farmers from the iLembe district municipality of the KwaZulu-Natal Province of South Africa was conducted, and the data were used to test the proposed model. Objectives: The study evaluates the influence of ICTs in improving food security in KwaZulu-Natal Province. A theoretical framework was developed as the lens through which diffusion and adoption of ICTs can be understood. The theorised model was developed using constructs from the diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory, technology acceptance model (TAM) and Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory. Method: Survey data from 517 smallholder farmers from the district municipality of iLembe were collected using a questionnaire. A quantitative approach was followed, and the developed theorised model was analysed using structural equation modelling techniques. Results: This study proposes that ICT influence on food security is associated with culture, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. The study further finds that perceived ease of use of ICTs has the most significant effect with regard to ICT adoption and diffusion amongst smallholder farmers in iLembe district municipality. There are, however, no associations found with perceived attributes of innovation and the nature of social systems. The study consisted of a largely homogeneous social system; therefore, the researcher could not make any comparisons. Conclusion: The proposed framework for evaluating the influence of ICTs on food security put forward in this study highlights a number of issues. Firstly, there is need for further study to be conducted to understand adoption of ICTs specifically for food security. This would help in creating more accurate adoption strategies. Secondly, the study informs ICT innovation developers on the need to prioritise ease of use of ICT-based interventions when developing innovations that focus on smallholder farmers. The study also contributes to policy guidelines and suggests clear guidelines be developed to address cultural aspects such as gender imbalances.

AB  - Population pressures have led to crop cultivation taking place on steep slopes and other marginal lands in the small island developing states of the Caribbean. This threatens regional food security and can result in environmental degradation if site-specific land management practices are not adopted. AgriMaps is a mobile application developed to support decision making in the agricultural sector of Trinidad and Tobago. This application uses an evidence-based approach to making crop and mitigative land management recommendations. The app is a platform for spatial data visualization and provides a greater range of geo-spatial information than is currently available to stakeholders in the farming community. It is envisioned that this application will improve land use planning decisions and the adoption of sustainable agricultural management techniques. We provide the theoretical and technical frameworks needed to develop similar ICT tools in other territories. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate and land-use change are the two main driving forces that affect watershed hydrological processes. Separately assessing their impacts on hydrology is important for land-use planning and water resource management. In this research, the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) and statistical methods were applied to evaluate the effects of climate and land-use change on surface hydrology in the hilly-gully region of the Loess Plateau. The results showed that surface runoff and soil water presented a downward tendency, while evapotranspiration (ET) presented an upward tendency in the Yanhe watershed from 1982 to 2012. Climate is one the dominant factors that influence surface runoff, especially in flooding periods. The average contribution rate of surface runoff on stream flow accounted for 55%, of which the flooding period accounted for 40%. The runoff coefficient declined by 0.21 after 2002 with the land-use change of cropland transformed to grassland and forestland. The soil water exhibited great fluctuation along the Yanhe watershed. In the upstream region, the land-use was the driving force to decline soil water, which reduced the soil water by 51%. Along the spatial distribution, it converted from land-use change to climate variability from northwest to southeast. The ET was more sensitive to land-use change than climate variability in all sub-basins, and increased by 209% with vegetation restoration. To prevent the ecosystem degradation and maintain the inherent ecological functions of rivers, quantitative assessment the influence of climate variability and land-use change on hydrology is of great importance. Such evaluations can provide insight into the extent of land use/cover change on regional water balance and develop appropriate watershed management strategies on the Loess Plateau.

AB  - The concentration of nitrous oxide (N2O), an ozone-depleting greenhouse gas, is rapidly increasing in the atmosphere. Most atmospheric N2O originates in terrestrial ecosystems, of which the majority can be attributed to microbial cycling of nitrogen in agricultural soils. Here, we demonstrate how the abundance of nitrogen cycling genes vary across intensively managed agricultural fields and adjacent restored wetlands in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California, USA. We found that the abundances of nirS and nirK genes were highest at the intensively managed organic-rich cornfield and significantly outnumber any other gene abundances, suggesting very high N2O production potential. The quantity of nitrogen transforming genes, particularly those responsible for denitrification, nitrification and DNRA, were highest in the agricultural sites, whereas nitrogen fixation and ANAMMOX was strongly associated with the wetland sites. Although the abundance of nosZ genes was also high at the agricultural sites, the ratio of nosZ genes to nir genes was significantly higher in wetland sites indicating that these sites could act as a sink of N2O. These findings suggest that wetland restoration could be a promising natural climate solution not only for carbon sequestration but also for reduced N2O emissions.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities have resulted in extensive deforestation and forest degradation on many tropical oceanic islands. For instance, some islands in the Solomon archipelago have as little as 10% of primary forests remaining with few of these remnants protected from future land use change. We examine the plant species and functional diversity (excluding adult canopy trees) of 48 sites from four forest land use types (two types of primary forest, secondary forest and abandoned tree plantations) and two common human-maintained land use types (coconut plantations and grazed pastures) across three elevation bands on Kolombangara Island, Solomon Islands. In total, we surveyed 384 species from 86 families of which only 6.5% were non-native. Species richness was lowest in coconut plantations and grazed pastures and declined with increasing elevation across all land use types. Functional diversity was similar between primary and secondary forest (high richness, high evenness and unaltered dispersion) and lowest in coconut plantations and grazed pastures. Our results suggest that species and functional richness have had divergent responses to land use change in forest land uses indicative of a loss of functional redundancy. Despite structural and compositional similarities among primary forests and degraded forest land uses, full recovery of secondary and commercial plantations has not been achieved. We suggest that conservation of Kolombangara's forest understory flora will require reserves across the island's elevation gradient and may require active restoration in the future, particularly if degrading activities continue at the current rate.

AB  - Recent reform of the Common Agricultural Policy has led to the decoupling of direct payments to farmers from production. This policy change is expected to make farmers' production decisions more market oriented as their subsidy revenue maximization objectives become profit maximizing objectives. In this paper we explore the impact of decoupling on the productivity of Irish dairy farms using a modified version of Olley and Pakes methodology for productivity estimation. We isolate the effect of decoupling on productivity by controlling for other policy changes that have occurred alongside decoupling. We also explore the effect that uncertainties associated with increased price volatility may have had on farmers' decisions in the post-decoupled period.

AB  - In the contemporary era of nutrition science, food industries are facing myriad challenges in assuring quality food with extended shelf life and long-term preservation. Biopolymer-based sustainable and biodegradable food packaging materials have helped the industries to meet these challenges. Additionally, these eco-friendly materials are also alleviating the environmental concerns associated with plastic-related pollution due to their excellent biodegradability, renewability, bioavailability, and non-toxicity. Herein, biopolymer-based food packaging materials and their composites, their biodegradation mechanisms, and the effect of nano-additives on the food packaging properties are presented. This review also elucidates ongoing research investigations for meeting current challenges by using these environmentally benign materials in food packaging applications. It is anticipated that the implementation of green technology could help in improving food quality and safety while reducing food loss and plastic waste, which will assist in achieving environmental sustainability goals.

AB  - With the rapidly growing global population, achieving sustainable food production is a key challenge to mitigate the closely coupled environmental and nutrition crises. As demand for dairy products increases, large volumes of whey are produced - a highly polluting byproduct from food manufacturing, with strict disposal regulations. However, whey has been recognized as an attractive nutrient source; and as such, sustainable separation technologies for demineralizing the highly concentrated salts in whey waste can provide a pathway for the valorization of whey proteins from food processing waste. Herein, we propose a sustainable and energy-efficient strategy to valorize whey waste via a redox-mediated electrodialysis system. As a net-zero waste process, our system leverages reversible redox reaction for continuous desalination and salt concentration for reuse, as well as the simultaneous recovery of highly purified protein contents. The system demonstrates up to 99% salt removal with > 98% of whey proteins retained at various operating parameters: voltages, pHs, and salt concentrations. Remarkably, the performance of protein purification and salt recovery was maintained over multiple cycles, demonstrating outstanding stability and cyclability. Furthermore, a techno-economic analysis confirms the economic potential of our system with 51-73% lower energy consumptions and 51-62% lower operating expenditure than conventional desalination systems. Overall, our redox-electrochemical process offers a sustainable and electrified platform for the recovery of valuable proteins from dairy production waste, with envisioned integration with renewable electricity in the future.

AB  - Growing consumer demand for safe and affordable food as well as the need for a sustainable food supply will force the producers to explore methods for production output increasing. The poultry industry has an important role in the provision of a sustainable food supply, especially because chickens have a high feed conversion efficiency compared to other birds or livestock and, chicken meat is a low greenhouse gas emission food compared to other sources of dietary protein and has accessible source of protein with a low-fat content. The most important aspect of broiler production is feeding, and it represents about 70% of total costs. In order to facilitate the broilers, feed mixture production, it is tending to replace corn component, with a new, cheaper but high-quality component. As an alternative, it is possible to use the old bread, which would enable its remediation. Its use in broiler feeding is possible only after thermal treatment. Following this work will include the possibilities of using 5 and 10% of the old white and brown bread share in broilers feed mixture after thermal processing by extrusion. Feeding with both types of old extruded bread proved to be satisfying and did not affect broilers performance so generally dried bread can be used in chicken feed by as a partial replacement for maize component. Although both breads have proved good feeding quality, slightly better results were obtained in feeding with 10% share of brown bread.

AB  - Early warning systems are essential tool for humanitarian preparedness and response. The diversity of inputs required, ranging from agricultural production estimates to market price variability and weather forecasts, means that interpreting food security signals is not an easy task. Each of these inputs is fraught with uncertainty which analysts need to assess when making projections about future food security. Understanding the accuracy rates of early warning systems is therefore of paramount importance to enable improvements to food security prediction. However, to date, limited analyses of early warning accuracy have been conducted. Here we analyze Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWS NET) early warning data for the Greater Horn of Africa and show that, despite accuracy in projections, there remain important challenges for food security projections. The two major sources of uncertainty are associated with complex weather phenomena and conflict - with uncertainty in weather forecasts being twice as important as conflict in overall FEWS NET accuracy. Indeed, the least accurate projections are recorded in seasons with particularly complex weather events such as the 2015/2016 El Nino Southern Oscillation as well as in zones that are affected by internal conflict (e.g. South Sudan). With respect to predicting crisis transitions, areas with more frequent transitions tend to be more accurate, possibly because predicting the drivers behind these transitions are better understood. Our novel analysis provides a framework to invest resources in specific aspects of early warning. We also hope that by measuring the reliability of these systems, we can increase the confidence of decision makers to act early to mitigate the growing risks posed by hunger and famine.

AB  - The conversion of food waste and sludge into biogas via anaerobic digestion technology is gaining attention in recent years, which plays a significant role in waste valorization into bioenergy and promotes environmental sustainability. Biochar is a carbonaceous material produced via thermochemical conversion of biomass waste, and tailoring biochar for diverse environmental applications adheres to the principle of circular economy. The emerging application of biochar as an additive in the anaerobic digestion of food waste and sludge has been intensively investigated in the last few years. However, a comprehensive understanding of multifunctional roles of biochar and its mechanisms in the production of biogas via miscellaneous/complex anaerobic digestion process is yet to be attained. This review scrutinizes the key roles of biochar as an additive and emphasizes the influences of biochar characteristics on the anaerobic digestion processes and their capability to address the foremost challenges. This review also evaluates the techno-economic and environmental impacts of biochar synthesis and its emerging application for biogas production via anaerobic digestion to make the integrated process more economical and environmentally sustainable, and identifies challenges and prospects for future studies.

AB  - CONTEXT: Globally, rainfed regions encounter several constraints that limit crop production. Poor and degraded soils resulting from soil erosion are one among them. We hypothesized that a diversified cropping system in rainfed drylands can reduce soil erosion and improve soil health and crop productivity and meet the food security needs of rainfed farmers. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to assess potential diversified cropping systems in terms of reducing soil erosion and water and nutrient losses, and increasing crop and systems productivity and profitability. METHODS: The study was carried out at the Gungal Research Farm of ICAR Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (17 o 05 ' N, 78 o 39 ' E) from 2015 to 16 to 2020 - 21. The study investigated seven diversified cropping systems (treatments): sorghum + pigeon pea- hedge lucerne, sorghum + pigeonpea- guinea grass, castor- hedge lucerne, castor- guinea grass, sorghum- fodder clusterbean- fodder cowpea- fodder horsegram, sole sorghum, and sole pigeonpea. Multi -criteria assessments were conducted to understand trade-offs related to soil nutrients and their losses, and productivity and profitability of various annual and perennial based systems. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Among the various systems evaluated, sole sorghum was the most sensitive to soil erosion, leading to highest amount of nutrient loss in all years (87.5, 47.3, and 9.8 kg N, P and K ha - 1 in 2019-20, 102.4, 58.2, 14.2 kg N, P and K ha -1 in 2020-21, and 78.6, 39.2, 6.16 kg N, P and K ha -1 in 2021-22). The perennial based cropping systems with more diverse crops and greater land cover that included sorghum + pigeonpea - guinea grass and sorghum + pigeon pea - hedge lucerne had the lowest amount of nutrient loss. The least cumulative monetary value of nutrient loss was in sorghum + pigeon pea - hedge lucerne (137.11 US$) followed by sorghum + pigeonpea - guinea grass (145.33 US$). The systems with diverse crops reduced runoff and soil erosion, improved soil health, and increased crop and systems productivity and profitability. The tradeoffs analysis using the radar graphs also showed lower soil loss and improved soil heath in diversified perennial based cropping systems, resulting in increase in net income to US$1981 for sorghum + pigeonpea - hedge lucerne compared to US$909 for sole sorghum. SIGNIFICANCE: Perennial based cropping systems with diverse crops can be an effective strategy to reduce soil erosion and improve soil health, and increase crop and systems productivity in rainfed areas of south India. These results have implications to other countries globally with rainfed climate and dryland farming.

AB  - Rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivation is critically important for global food security, yet it also represents a significant fraction of agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and water resource use. Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) of rice fields has been shown to reduce both methane (CH4) emissions and water use, but its effect on grain yield is variable. In this three-year study we measured CH4 and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, rice grain total arsenic (As) concentrations, yield response to N rate, and grain yield from two AWD treatments (drill-seeded and water-seeded) and a conventionally managed water seeded treatment (control). Grain yields (average= 10 Mg ha(-1)) were similar or higher in the AWD treatments compared to the control and required similar or lower N rates to achieve these yields. Furthermore, AWD reduced growing season CH4 emissions by 60-87% while maintaining low annual N2O emissions (average = 0.38 kg N2O-N ha(-1)); N2O emissions accounted for <15% of the annual global warming potential (GWP) in all treatments. Fallow season emissions did not vary by treatment and accounted for 22-53% of annual CH4 emissions and approximately one third of annual GWP on average. The AWD treatments reduced annual GWP by 57-74% and growing season yield-scaled GWP by 59-88%. Milled grain total As, which averaged 0.114 mg kg(-1) in the control, was reduced by 59-65% in the AWD treatments. These results show that AWD has the potential to mitigate GHG emissions associated with rice cultivation and reduce rice grain total As concentrations without sacrificing grain yield or requiring higher N inputs; however future research needs to focus on adapting AWD to field scales if adoption of thiS technology is to be realized.

AB  - Since time immemorial, seed has been stored through indigenous methods as per people's convenience and access to contemporary technologies. Thus, indigenous traditional methods have become essential component of sustainable agriculture and it varies from region to region. However, with modernization, urbanization and the associated technological breakthroughs, the indigenous technologies have been eroded and are not passed on to next generation. In the present study, attempt has been made to identify some of the traditional methods and associated knowledge called Indigenous Traditional Knowledge (ITK), linked to storage of seeds and grains followed by the people of Sikkim, the organic state of North-eastern India. ITKs were collected from 04 villages of east district and 02 villages of west district of Sikkim. Total of 06 (bhakari, kotha, jhutta, dalo, chindo and dhikuti) traditional storage structures were identified which are commonly used by the people of Sikkim to store grains. Utilizing the locally available materials people has designed their own eco-friendly and safe storage structures for storing grains.

AB  - The conflict between economic growth and the arable land demand poses a significant challenge to maintaining food security and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Meanwhile, substantial regional disparities in food consumption contribute to variations in land demand, further exacerbating constraints on food security. However, few studies have delved into regional differences in land demand related to food consumption. To bridge these gaps, this study estimated the arable land demand and associated pressures, considering food consumption patterns and the land footprint across 31 provincial districts in China. The findings reveal that grains remain the primary crop consumed by Chinese residents. Notably, the food consumption pattern exhibits substantial disparities among provincial districts, particularly concerning livestock products. Given China's vast population and escalating consumption of livestock, the country demonstrates heightened land demands. While China does not face a national-level food security threat, regional disparities are evident, with eight provincial districts facing potential food security risks. This study explored the challenges and pathways in maintaining food security and the visions to achieve it, emphasizing the importance of sustaining a balanced food consumption pattern, reducing food waste, improving environmentally friendly agriculture practices, formulating effective and continuous laws and regulations, and exploring potential land resource development to alleviate the pressure on arable land and ensure food security.

AB  - Protected forest has important roles in protecting life support systems through water manage-ment, maintain micro climate stability, flood prevention, erosion control, prevention of seawater intrusion and maintenance of soil fertility. Deforestation in protected forest areas will reduce the roles, however, deforestation appeared to occur in forested areas of Bantur Regency. Infrastruc-ture development which is growing rapidly and the compleexity of economic activities is driving deforestation in this region. The deforestation caused water supply problems, landslide and de-creased endemic bird population ("rangkong") in study areas. Therefore it is necessary to identify deforestation through land cover change assessment. This study aims at (1) quantifying the forest land cover changes in protected forest areas of Bantur and Donomulyo Regency, (2) identifying environmental condition in protected forest areas of Bantur and Donomulyo Regency. Landsat TM, ETM+ and 8 were used together with Random Forest classification for mapping the forest areas. Carbon Monoxide (CO) and temperature were used as biophysical factors in the model. The results of this study suggested the continuing deforestation with the existence of roads, economic activity, and tourism development triggered the deforestation pattern. Role of community was also found to affect the nature of deforestation.

AB  - Changes in the land use pattern and in the land cover structure for the time interval 1995-2012 in Thailand are considered by using, as an example, Nan Province located in the northern mountainous part of the country. Interpretation of satellite images and vector data that were provided by the Land Development Department (Thailand) revealed the main directions of change in the region's land use: deforestation, expansion of areas under crops, transition from slash and burn cultivation to permanent cultivation, and intensive utilization of agrochemicals. In spite of a decrease in the deforestation rate across Thailand in general, it is shown that for the period under review the proportion of natural forests in Nan Province decreased by nearly one half. On the other hand, the agricultural lands increased for the same period by more than 50%. The highest deforestation rates were recorded during 2009-2012. It was found that the changes in the land use pattern disturbed the existing centuries-old balance of man-natural environment interaction within the framework of the traditional system of slash and burn agriculture which is well adapted to local conditions. The study revealed the chief causes for such changes: an ineffective monitoring of forests; an unclear character of the boundaries separating lands of rural communities and protected territories, and possibilities for sales of commercial products (maize, cassava, etc.) cultivated in illegal fields. It is shown that rapid changes in land cover due to deforestation and plowing of mountainous areas for cultivation of commercial crops led to an intensification of slope processes (landslides and solifluction), an increase in overland runoff, and to an enhanced hazard of heavy floods during the monsoon season. To keep track of deforestation and deal with nature management conflicts requires a continuous monitoring of the land cover dynamics.

AB  - Purpose Land use type is an important factor influencing greenhouse gas emissions from soils, but the mechanisms involved in affecting potential greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in different land use systems are poorly understood. Since the northern regions of Canada and China are characterized by cool growing seasons, GHG emissions under low temperatures are important for our understanding of how soil temperature affects soil C and N turnover processes and associated greenhouse gas emissions in cool temperate regions. Therefore, we investigated the effects of temperature on the emission of N2O, CO2, and CH4 from typical forest and grassland soils from China and Canada. Materials and methods The soils were incubated in the laboratory at 10 degrees C and 15 degrees C under aerobic conditions for 15 days. Results and discussion The results showed that land use type had a large impact on greenhouse gas emissions. The N2O emissions were significantly higher in grassland than in forest soils, while CO2 emissions were higher in forest than in grassland soils. Grassland soils were weak sources of CH4 emission, while forest soils were weak sinks of atmospheric CH4. The global warming potential of forest soils was significantly greater than that of grassland soils. Soil pH, C/N ratio, and soluble organic carbon concentrations and clay content were dominant factors influencing the emissions of N2O and CO2, respectively. Increasing temperature from 10 degrees C to 15 degrees C had no effects on CH4 flux, but significantly increased N2O emissions for all studied soils. The same pronounced effect was also found for CO2 emission from forest soils. Conclusions Indications from this study are that the effects of land use type on the source-sink relationship and rates of GHG emissions should be taken into consideration when planning management strategies for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions in the studied region, and temperature changes must be taken into account when scaling up point-or plot-based N2O and CO2 flux data to the landscape level due to large spatial and temporal variations of temperature that exist in the field. The reader is cautioned about the limitation with incubation studies on a limited number of samples/locations, and care need to be exercised to extrapolate the result to field conditions.

AB  - Climate change and Philippine forests are directly linked to each other. Changes in climate are affecting the forests and its ability to deliver its environmental services. In the same manner, degradation of the forest resources results to emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere which contributes to climate change. To enhance the mitigation role of the forests and at the same time increase their resilience to climate change, policies and programs must be put in place. Such policies and programs must however be science-based This paper reviewed one decade of research on climate change and forest ecosystems in the Philippines. Limited research suggests that dry forest types are the most vulnerable to climate change. Potential adaptation strategies do exist but have not yet been adequately studied Most of the past research has focused on the mitigation potential of terrestrial ecosystems. Significant amount of carbon is conserved in natural forests (up to 250 MgC/ha). These stored carbon can be emitted to the atmosphere as CO2 gas through deforestation. Planted trees have a high rate of carbon sequestration (mean of 4.3 MgC/ha/yr) and could help mitigate greenhouse gas concentration. Lessons that are relevant to forest management in the country are extracted Future research needs are suggested

AB  - Purpose - The paper examines one of Scotland's major pork supply chains and seeks to identify the key risks and challenges involved in developing a resilient agri-food supply system, particularly with regard to primary product supply, and to show how risk management and collaboration amongst stakeholders can increase chain resilience. Design/methodology/approach - The case study involved in-depth interviews with seven people involved in the chain and its management. Findings - Reduced supply chain vulnerability to risks arose through horizontal collaboration amongst producers, and vertical collaboration with the processor and retailer. Producers improved market and price security, and pig performance. For the processor and retailer the collaboration generated greater security of supply of an assured quality, improved communication with suppliers, and reduced demand risk as they could assure consumers on quality, animal welfare and product provenance. Research limitations/implications - The study's findings are based on the analysis of a particular supply chain, but the cooperative concerned currently produces over half of Scotland's weekly pig production. Practical implications The findings are highly transferable to other agri-food supply chains. Producers' successful efforts to deal with different risks and the role of collaboration in enhancing chain resilience are illustrated. Originality/value The case is interesting because pigmeat supply profitability has been under constant pressure. It discusses the risks faced by all chain participants and the collective development of a chain which is relatively resilient to variations in price, production and supply.

AB  - BackgroundControlling rice tillering and flowering is essential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from paddy fields, a key objective in climate-smart agriculture. However, the interaction between tillering and flowering remains controversial and poorly understood. In this study, we subjected plants of the rice cultivars 'Saenuri' and 'Odae' to short- and long-day conditions and compared their growth and flowering responses after tiller removal.ResultsThe effects of tiller removal differed depending on daylength conditions. Under short days, plants in the tiller-removal group flowered earlier than the controls, whereas the opposite trend was observed under long days. This response was associated with changes in florigen gene expression. Under short days, the expression of Hd3a, which promotes flowering, increased in the tiller-removal group compared with that in the controls. In contrast, under long days, the expression of OsMFT1, a gene that delays flowering and promotes spikelet formation, was significantly upregulated, leading to an increased spikelet number. Notably, spikelets per panicle in the tiller-removal groups increased approximately 3.4-fold in 'Saenuri' and 2.2-fold in 'Odae' under long-day conditions compared with those in their respective controls.ConclusionsThese findings highlight the daylength-dependent variability in tillering and flowering interactions, providing new insights into their regulatory mechanisms. This study offers a foundation for optimizing rice growth strategies under varying photoperiod conditions, contributing to climate-smart agricultural practices and improved breeding programs.

AB  - In recent decades, scarcity of available resources, population growth and the widening in the consumption of processed foods and of animal origin have made the current food system unsustainable. High-income countries have shifted towards food consumption patterns which is causing an increasingly process of environmental degradation and depletion of natural resources, with the increased incidence of malnutrition due to excess (obesity and non-communicable disease) and due to chronic food deprivation. An urgent challenge is, therefore, to move towards more healthy and sustainable eating choices and reorientating food production and distribution to obtain a human and planetary health benefit. In this regard, legumes represent a less expensive source of nutrients for low-income countries, and a sustainable healthier option than animal-based proteins in developed countries. Although legumes are the basis of many traditional dishes worldwide, and in recent years they have also been used in the formulation of new food products, their consumption is still scarce. Common beans, which are among the most consumed pulses worldwide, have been the focus of many studies to boost their nutritional properties, to find strategies to facilitate cultivation under biotic/abiotic stress, to increase yield, reduce antinutrients contents and rise the micronutrient level. The versatility of beans could be the key for the increase of their consumption, as it allows to include them in a vast range of food preparations, to create new formulations and to reinvent traditional legume-based recipes with optimal nutritional healthy characteristics.

AB  - Purpose Since application of ecological soil evaluation is not widely introduced in planning processes, a need for harmonisation of soil evaluation methods and spatial planning is evident. Conflicts are caused by the discrepancy between a holistic and site-specific approach of soil evaluation and the demand of spatial planners for easy-to-handle planner-oriented evaluation methods. Planners require less differentiation of pedological aspects but a detailed consideration of land use aspects. The aim of this paper is to illustrate the evolution of the concept of soil function and the development of the understanding of the soil functionality with time, respectively. This is reflected before the background of its applicability for spatial planning. Restrictions and deficits are highlighted, and strategies for further research work are sketched. The relation of soil functions and soil evaluation is examined exemplarily with algorithms of the TUSEC method applied for typical but fictive planning situations. Main features An introduction comprising the early history of soil evaluation and the widening of the view on soil functionality with time is given. Since 1978, the restriction on the function of soil to biomass productivity was overcome, and today, a set of ecological functions ensuring a sustainable land use is introduced. This process is reflected here by drawing a time order of definitions of soil functions, whereas the function of soil as carbon stock and genetic pool are the most recently accepted ones. In addition, functions of special meaning for the environmental quality in urban areas are highlighted. The multi-functionality of soil is reflected as a basic principle of the modern understanding of soils. It is explained here that the complexity of the concept of multi-functionality of soils does not fit directly to the administrative sight on the belongings of soil protection. Therefore, the chapters in this paper dealing with principle aspects of soil functions are followed by passages focusing on the application of soil functions, its practice, problems and perspectives. Results and discussion Strategies for future adaptations of soil evaluation to the requirements of spatial planning are discussed. Thus, strategies to summarise soil functions are sketched, and a reasonable land use specified soil evaluation is proposed. Conclusions Spatial planning needs a method for soil evaluation allowing a multi-level approach and some simplifications to meet the goals of rational land-use planning. Further work on this topic is strongly necessary to make efforts in soil protection and to support sustainable land use or, if anything, to bring sustainability into effect.

AB  - The current agro-industrial system must develop a more efficient and sustainable food production model to achieve greater food security for the expanding global population, in alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlined in the European Agenda 2030. A green and sustainable solution for the feed-food production dilemma may be the use of agricultural by-products (AB) in livestock feeding. The ABs are what remains of fruits and vegetables after industrial processing, containing a plethora of bioactive compounds. Currently, their direct utilization in livestock nutrition is growing, but more research is needed to deeply discover their potential in terms of health-promoting compounds. Lentils (Lens culinaria L.), belonging to the Fabaceae family and commonly categorized as pulses, have historically served as a staple food for humans. Post-harvest processing of lentils yields various by-products (e.g. straw, hulls, screenings) that possess high nutritive value and are rich in phytochemicals, making them suitable for incorporation into balanced diets for numerous livestock species, including poultry and rabbits. This review focuses on the available knowledge on lentil by-products (LB), their nutritive value and phytochemicals including the main dietary effects on growth and productive parameters of poultry and rabbits.

AB  - Currently, there is an ongoing intensive search for solutions that would effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions (mainly methane) into the environment. From a practical point of view, it is important to reduce methane emissions from cows in such a way as to simultaneously trim emissions from the digestive system and increase its potential production from feces, which is intended as a substrate used in biogas plants. Such a solution would not only lower animal-based methane emissions but would also enable the production of fuel (in chemical form) with a high yield of methane from biogas, which would boost the economic benefits and reduce the use of fossil fuels. We tested the effect of administering an essential oil blend consisting of 5.5% oils and fats on methane and biogas production from dairy cow feces during fermentation. Three subsequent series (control and experimental) were conducted in dairy cows fed a total mixed ration (TMR) rich in brewer's cereals and beet pulp, with 20% dry matter (DM) of the total diet. Cows from the experimental group received 20 g/cow/day of essential oil blend, namely a commercial additive (CA). The study showed that CA can increase the production of methane and biogas from dairy cow feces. It can be concluded that in the experimental groups, approx. 15.2% and 14.4% on a fresh matter basis and 11.7% and 10.9% on a dry matter basis more methane and biogas were generated compared to the control group, respectively. Therefore, it can be assumed that the use of CA in cow nutrition improved dietary digestibility, which increased the efficiency of the use of feces organic matter for biogas production.

AB  - Introduction Agriculture faces significant challenges in ensuring global food security while minimizing resource costs and environmental impacts. The development of digital infrastructure offers transformative potential for agricultural systems and aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This study examines the role of digital infrastructure in enhancing grain production capacity in China, a key player in the global food system.Methods We analyzed data from 277 prefecture-level cities in China from 2011 to 2021. A double machine learning model was employed to empirically assess the impact of digital infrastructure on grain production capacity, allowing for robust insights into causal relationships.Results Results reveal that digital infrastructure significantly enhances grain production. Mechanism analysis results indicate that digital infrastructure construction drives agricultural technological advancements and farmland scale, contributing to increased production capacity. Heterogeneity analysis results show that the impact of digital infrastructure construction is significant in major grain-producing regions and the central-eastern regions, while its effects are relatively limited in grain production-consumption balanced regions, main grain consumption regions, and the western regions.Discussion The results underscore the importance of strengthening digital infrastructure in rural areas to improve grain production capacity. Tailored policy implications are suggested to enhance sustainable food production and contribute to global food security, particularly in regions with varying agricultural dynamics.

AB  - Reducing emissions due to deforestation is considered a low-cost option for mitigating climate change. However, the recent literature suggests higher opportunity costs because of specific deforestation drivers, which render reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) for mitigating climate change an uncertain, less attractive, and controversial option. Indonesia is one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters. Since 1989, 53.80% of its oil palm expansion has come from forestlands, which has generated a significant amount of carbon emissions. This study uses official data and results from the relevant literature to estimate the costs of oil palm-based deforestation under various scenario assumptions, including different output prices, yields, time horizons, and discount rates. We also calculate the additional cost to preserve a 1-ha forest. We demonstrate that the average opportunity cost from avoiding oil palm-based deforestation is 24.42 USD/tCO(2)eq in Indonesia, approximately 1.3 times the 2011 EUA carbon price. Additional sums of around 5,466.90-11,042.96 USD/ha should be provided to landowners for the deforestation avoidance caused by oil palm expansion. Special attention should be given to the extensive oil palm expansion in Indonesia and the resulting high opportunity costs for achieving the REDD+ target.

AB  - Biochar has been widely used for soil remediation and carbon sequestration. However, the effects of biochar and earthworms on the mineralization of soil organic matter (SOM) remain controversial. In this study, SOM mineralization in top and deep soils with or without earthworm activity and 0.5% (w/w) maize straw biochar was investigated during a 43-day incubation experiment. The results showed that the organic carbon content was reduced after incubation, particularly during earthworm activity. The addition of biochar retained easily degradable fractions (such as tryptophan and tyrosine), whereas earthworms promoted the degradation of these fractions. Earthworms significantly increased the soil respiration rate and soil carbon emissions. The addition of biochar stimulated SOM mineralization under the effect of earthworms in the top soil within 7 days; however, biochar inhibited carbon emissions under earthworm activity for a longer time. Compared with deep soil, earthworms had a stronger respiration effect on top soil, which was mainly attributed to the more easily degradable SOM in the top soil. Overall, the positive effects of biochar on carbon sequestration were more pronounced under earthworm activity. This study emphasizes that soil mineralization was affected by biochar and soil macrofauna, particularly in areas with intense human activity.

AB  - The increasing "non-grainization" of paddy fields affecting large-scale grain cultivation and impacting the sustainable eco-functions protection of soil bacterial in China. The same problem of "non-grainization" has threatened food security and farmland soil ecological functions in other areas of the world. Although previous research has demonstrated that soil microorganisms are strongly affected by land use change, little is known about the effects of paddy field non-grainization consolidation (NGC) on soil microorganisms. This study examined soil samples before and after paddy field NGC in Zhejiang province, China, measured soil environmental factors and performed 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing to analyze the changes in soilbacterial communities and ecosystem functions before and after NGC. Results show that NGC increased the relative abundances of Proteobacteria (27.89%) and Actinobacteria (25.25%) in the project zones. Total soil bacteria increased in all samples after NGC implementation in terms of absolute soil bacterial community content, but there were large differences. NGC improved the alpha diversity indices, including Ace, Chao1, Coverage, and Shannon indices (p < 0.01) in terms of soil bacterial community diversity. The data analysis of RDA and the significance test showed that the environmental factors which were close-knitted with the soil bacterial diversity and structure of the sample sites were TN, AP, pH, SOM, FIQ, and AK. Wilcoxon rank sum test results showed that NGC also significantly enhanced the amino acid transport and metabolic functions of soil bacterial. Our findings suggest that NGC is beneficial to improve the paddy field soil bacterial diversity, enhance the versatility of soil ecosystems, and promote sustainable arable land soil ecosystem protection. The quantitative results would be useful for better studying the use of land remediation engineering measures to the remediation and maintenance of bacterial diversity and sustainable eco-functions protection in paddy fields.

AB  - The production and consumption of food are responsible for serious environmental degradation. Given the nature of the global economy, the impacts of food are dispersed over the full extent of the planet because food commodities may travel long distances from production to consumption. In this Primer, we introduce the principles of life cycle assessment (LCA), which allows for the assessment of the global extent of the inputs, outputs, and potential environmental impacts throughout the life cycle of a product system. We describe how LCA works following the standard phases of (1) goal and scope, (2) life cycle inventory, (3) life cycle impact assessment, and (4) interpretation. Weshow that LCA studies can capture the environmental impacts of foods, diets, and food production systems. While LCA has been expanding in scope and breadth, collaboration across disciplines is needed to further capture the diversity of food systems and to better deal with underassessed foods.

AB  - Women's role in agriculture is widely reported to be essential; despite this, women's role in the wheat-sector is under-researched. Feminist standpoint theory is applied in analyzing 73 documents on women's role in agriculture from 1990 until 2016 to answer the following questions: How does the world look, and operate, for males and females in wheat growing households? What do we know about social relationships and mediating processes (i.e., social factors mediating men's and women's access to resources and activities) that exist in the prime wheat growing regions in Pakistan? The paper highlights a knowledge gap in relation to the life histories, local experiences, as well as unofficial and informal networks of small farmers in general, and of poor and marginalized women in particular. This neglect of rural subjects is a missed opportunity to learn and to engage in improved program design that contributes to enhanced food security and resilience in rural communities. The paper is relevant to development professionals and agriculture researchers and proposes further research questions on topics that appear to have an influence on women's role in wheat farming and food systems and women's ability to be successful in securing a wheat-based livelihood.

AB  - Feeding the city is an issue of increasing importance because of the inadequate production capabilities of urban and peri-urban agri-food systems. In fact, urban areas are becoming more densely populated, and their impact in environmental, economic and social terms is becoming increasingly important, particularly in metropolitan contexts. For this reason, even in terms of food security, the analysis of alternative food systems that support or, in some cases, replace traditional systems is interesting. The spatial definition of a metropolitan food system and the quantification of its food supply and demand, are important for the territorial and the agricultural development of the metropolitan area. This paper proposes a tool to assess Metropolitan Agri-food Systems (MAS) and to analyse food demand and supply in the defined zone. In particular the methodology has been applied to two metropoles: Milan and Paris.

AB  - Issue AddressedClimate change is a defining public health issue of the 21st century. Food systems are drivers of diet-related disease burden, and account for 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Local governments play a crucial role in improving both the healthiness and environmental sustainability of food systems, but the potential for their actions to simultaneously address these two issues is unclear. This study aimed to explore the perceptions of Australian local government stakeholders regarding policy actions simultaneously addressing healthy eating and climate change, and the influences on policy adoption.MethodsWe conducted 11 in-depth semi-structured interviews with stakeholders from four local governments in Victoria, Australia. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. We applied Multiple Streams Theory (MST) 'problem', 'politics and 'policy' domains to explain policy adoption influences at the local government level.ResultsKey influences on local government action aligned with MST elements of 'problem' (e.g., local government's existing risk reports as drivers for climate change action), 'policy' (e.g., budgetary constraints) and 'politics' (e.g., local government executive agenda). We found limited evidence of coherent policy action in the areas of community gardens, food procurement and urban land use.ConclusionBarriers to further action, such as resource constraints and competing priorities, could be overcome by better tailoring policy action areas to community needs, with the help of external partnerships and local government executive support.So What?This study demonstrates that Victorian local stakeholders believe they are well-positioned to implement feasible and coherent interventions that address both healthy eating and climate.

AB  - Organic farming is considered a sustainable agricultural practice that can enhance soil health and reduce environmental pollution. However, the long-term effect of organic farming on soil quality, microbial structure and functions, as well as the underly mechanism still remains incomplete. Here, we investigated the effect of 5, 15, and 20 years of organic farming on soil chemical and biological properties at 0-20 cm (topsoil) and 20-40 cm (subsoil) depths in comparison with conventional farming in a subtropical region. The Soil quality index (SQI) was calculated using a total dataset of soil nutrients (i e., SOC, TN, TP, etc.), enzyme activities (C- and Nacquiring enzymes), and microbial diversity (Fungal chao1, bacterial chao1). The results showed that organic farming significantly increased soil quality by 53-103 % in topsoil and by 25-142 % in subsoil. Organic farming increased soil total and available nutrients, soil water content, C- and N-acquiring enzyme activities, and microbial diversity. Compared to conventional farming, the enzyme activities for C- and N- acquisition in organic farming increased by 3 times and 2 times, respectively, and stabilized over time. Microbial community analysis indicated a rich and complex network under long-term organic management, with a notable increase in the number of nodes and edges (doubled after 20-year), signifying a more resilient ecosystem. In conclusion, longterm organic farming significantly enhances soil quality and microbial diversity, with the most substantial improvements observed in longer duration, thereby supporting the sustainability of agricultural practices in subtropical regions. The study underscores the importance of long-term organic farming in improving soil quality and provides scientific evidence for advocating sustainable agricultural practices in subtropical regions.

AB  - Soil carbon is major driver of climate in the long term because soil can either decrease global warming by carbon sequestration or increase warming by emissions of greenhouse gases. Soil inorganic carbon is mainly composed of carbonates and represents globally more than half of the total soil carbon stock up to a 2-m depth. The dissolution of carbonates by fertilization-induced acidification may offset the global efforts aimed at organic carbon sequestration, yet this process is poorly understood. Here, we evaluated the effects of fertilization strategies on inorganic carbon contents and stocks to 120 cm soil depth by using natural delta C-13 signature of organic and inorganic carbon in 32- and 40-year field experiments. Results show that long-term application of mineral nitrogen and phosphorous fertilizers acidified soils by 0.2 pH units. This caused inorganic carbon dissolution and carbon dioxide emissions of 9-12 Mg C per hectare, representing 12-18% of the initial stock in the top 60 cm. By contrast, manure application increased inorganic carbon stock by 8.9-11 Mg C per hectare, representing 4.8-17% of the initial stock up to 120 cm depth. The main pathway of inorganic carbon accumulation under organic fertilization is the neoformation of pedogenic carbonates and the conservation of lithogenic carbonates. Manure combined with mineral fertilizers did not affect inorganic carbon and therefore provides an optimal solution to mitigate carbon losses from soil.

AB  - The threat of long-term climate change has driven a number of international and national bodies to call for a re-direction of development pathways so that they are more resource efficient and use less carbon (C) in the form of fossil fuel per unit of economic growth and cause lower greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). Agriculture is one of the largest anthropogenic sources of GHG emissions yet few authorities take account of this fact in their proposals and programmes for low C development. Hence this policy review examines the case for promoting strategies and policies for low C agricultural growth. Most of the policy and technological options that it considers have already been put forward by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and others in the context of climate change mitigation, but constraints to their implementation have often been underestimated. This review reassesses their potential contribution in the light of known bio-physical, socio-economic and institutional limitations. It concludes that there is a very strong case for greatly increasing the priority given to policies for low C growth which can be true winwinwin responses. Many of them are more cost-effective than the responses available to other sectors. They can be pro-poor and have other socio-economic benefits. They not only limit GHG emissions but also provide a range of other environmental and ecosystem benefits. However there can be significant barriers to implementation that must be overcome by national policies shaped to meet the needs of different farmer groups and agricultural systems.

AB  - Low-income families, especially those who reside in food deserts, face significant systemic barriers regarding their ability to access affordable and nutritious food. The food behaviors exhibited by low-income families are a reflection of the shortcomings of the built environment and conventional food system. Policy and public-health initiatives to improve food security have, thus far, failed to deliver interventions that simultaneously address multiple pillars of food security. Centering the voices of the marginalized and their place-based knowledge may result in the development of food-access solutions that are a much better fit for the population that they intend to serve. Community-based participatory research has emerged as a solution to better meet the needs of communities in food-systems innovation, but little is known about the extent to which direct participation improves nutritional outcomes. The purpose of this research is to answer the following question: how can food-access solutions authentically engage marginalized community members in food-system innovation, and if participation is related to changes in their food behaviors, how is it related? This action research project leveraged a mixed-methods approach to analyze nutritional outcomes and define the nature of participation for 25 low-income families who reside in a food desert. Our findings suggest that nutritional outcomes improve when major barriers to healthy food consumption are addressed, for example, time, education, and transportation. Furthermore, participation in social innovations can be characterized by the nature of involvement as either a producer or consumer, actively or inactively involved. We conclude that when marginalized communities are at the center of food-systems innovation, individuals self-select their level of participation, and when primary barriers are addressed, deeper participation in food-systems innovation is associated with positive changes in healthy food behaviors.

AB  - We monitored the land use changes in a hilly area of West Lampung, South Sumatra, Indonesia, from 1970 to 1990. The main data sources were the land use maps produced in 1970, 1978, 1984 and 1990 covering the area of 27 km x 27 km. Transmigration and the resultant effect of increased population were the major driving forces in land use changes. Fifty-seven per cent of the study area was covered with primary forests in 1970, but only 13% in 1990. Areas under plantations, which were absent in 1970, increased to 60% in 1990. In addition, the change from monoculture plantations (mostly coffee plantation) to mixed plantations was noticeable from 1984 to 1990. Total upland areas including upland areas under shifting cultivation and upland fields with crops and vegetables decreased from 21% in 1970 to 0.1% in 1990. Soil chemical properties (total organic C, total N, available P, total P, exchangeable cations, cation exchangeable capacity (CEC), etc.) were analysed for lands under different land use forms after deforestation in the study area. Soil samples (surface layers, 0-20 cm, and subsurface layers, 20-40 cm) were collected from three different locations, each comprised of four different land use systems: i.e. primary forests, secondary forests, coffee plantations and cultivated lands. The contents of total organic C, total N, available P, total P, exchangeable cations and CEC decreased significantly with land use change from primary forests to the other land use forms. Cultivated lands exhibited the lowest values. Although less remarkable than in the surface layers, the amounts of total organic C, total N, total P, exchangeable cations and CEC were also decreased by forest clearing in the subsurface layers. Based on the land use changes from 1978 in the study area and the deterioration of soil chemical properties by forest clearing, total decreases in the amounts of nutrients in the surface and subsurface layers were estimated. The land use changes were estimated to have decreased the total amounts of total organic C, total N, available P, total P, exchangeable cations and CEC by 2-9% in 1984 and by 2-15% in 1990 in the surface layers, and by 1-6%% in 1984 and by 2-9% in 1990 in the subsurface layers from the levels in 1978, respectively.

AB  - Equitable distribution of rural lands amongst farming communities plays a pivotal role in food production and contributes to adequate calorie intake. Based on land distribution, this study estimates the disparities of operational farmland holdings at the district level in Pakistan, and ranks the districts in terms of land distribution in descending order. It also investigates the impact of land distribution, farm fragmentation, and land-use intensity on various aspects of food security (i.e., food availability, food access, and food absorption) by employing Pearson correlation and econometric models. The results from show that food security is heigthened with the improvement in distribution of land (i.e., operational land holdings) and land-use intensity, while food security declines with an increase in farm fragmentation. Therefore, land reform policies which aim to reduce disparity in land distribution and fragmentation would strongly contribute to enhancing food security in Pakistan.

AB  - Mahmud AA, Abdulrahman MD. 2025. Comparing poultry manure and cow dung on Arachis hypogaea growth in Savanna environment. Nusantara Bioscience 17: 21-29. The study investigated the effects of poultry manure and cow dung on the growth of Arachis hypogaea L. (groundnut) in a controlled experimental setup at the botanical garden of Department of Plant Science and Biotechnology, Federal University Dutsin-Ma, Katsina State, Nigeria. The experiment followed a Completely Randomized Block Design (CRBD) with two organic fertilizer as treatments; poultry manure cow dung, and a control sample with no fertilizer. Two groundnut seeds varieties; pure red and light tan mixed each separately with cow dung, and poultry manure, and were subjected to viability test before planting. Growth parameters, including the number of leaves and plant height, were measured monthly for five months. The data obtained were analyzed using SPSS statistical software version 21, and significant differences were identified with Duncan's multiple range tests at a 5% probability level. Results indicated a significant impact of organic fertilizers on the growth parameters. The results revealed that cow dung promotes early growth while poultry manure contributes more to reproductive success and yield. The control group showed significantly lower leaf development, with an average of (43.4) leaves. The findings highlight the role of organic fertilizers in enhancing plant leaf production, as they provide essential nutrients that are often deficient in untreated soils. In terms of plant height, the light tan variety treated with cow dung achieved the greatest average height (16.53 cm), surpassing both the control (15.4 cm) and the pure red variety treated with poultry manure (13.45 cm). Overall, the study emphasizes the importance of using organic fertilizers like poultry manure and cow dung to improve groundnut growth, reduce dependence on synthetic fertilizers, and enhance soil health. These organic amendments are beneficial for sustainable agricultural practices, contributing to improved crop yield and environmental sustainability.

AB  - Intensification of staple crops through conventional agricultural practices with chemical synthetic inputs has yielded positive outcomes in food security but with negative environmental impacts. Ecological intensification using cropping systems such as maize edible-legume intercropping (MLI) systems has the potential to enhance soil health, agrobiodiversity and significantly influence crop productivity. However, mechanisms underlying enhancement of biological soil health have not been well studied. This study investigated the shifts in rhizospheric soil and maize-root microbiomes and associated soil physico-chemical parameters in MLI systems of smallholder farms in comparison to maize-monoculture cropping systems (MMC). Maize-root and rhizospheric soil samples were collected from twenty-five farms each conditioned by MLI and MMC systems in eastern Kenya. Soil characteristics were assessed using Black oxidation and Walkley methods. High-throughput amplicon sequencing was employed to analyze fungal and bacterial communities, predicting their functional roles and diversity. The different MLI systems significantly impacted soil and maize-root microbial communities, resulting in distinct microbe sets. Specific fungal and bacterial genera and species were mainly influenced and enriched in the MLI systems (e.g., Bionectria solani, Sarocladium zeae, Fusarium algeriense, and Acremonium persicinum for fungi, and Bradyrhizobium elkanii, Enterobacter roggenkampii, Pantoea dispersa and Mitsuaria chitosanitabida for bacteria), which contribute to nutrient solubilization, decomposition, carbon utilization, plant protection, bio-insecticides/fertilizer production, and nitrogen fixation. Conversely, the MMC systems enriched phytopathogenic microbial species like Sphingomonas leidyi and Alternaria argroxiphii. Each MLI system exhibited a unique composition of fungal and bacterial communities that shape belowground biodiversity, notably affecting soil attributes, plant well-being, disease control, and agroecological services. Indeed, soil physico-chemical properties, including pH, nitrogen, organic carbon, phosphorus, and potassium were enriched in MLI compared to MMC cropping systems. Thus, diversification of agroecosystems with MLI systems enhances soil properties and shifts rhizosphere and maize-root microbiome in favor of ecologically important microbial communities.

AB  - Integrated systems are efficient technologies used for diversifying production and promoting agricultural sustainability. The benefits of double intercropping are well-established in research. With advancements in sustainable food production technology, some studies have explored triple intercropping by adding legumes. However, triple intercropping methods must be comprehensively understood. This study aimed to evaluate the production of dry mass, fermentation profile, and nutritive values of silage from maize based intercropping. The experiment was conducted in the field, in Instituto Federal Goiano, Campus Rio Verde, State of Goi & aacute;s, Brazil, where we assessed silage production and quality in monoculture and intercropping systems, in a randomized block complete design with three replications. We evaluated 8 treatments, consisting of silage from: maize monoculture; Tamani guinea grass monoculture; Qu & ecirc;nia guinea grass monoculture; Zuri guinea grass monoculture; Pigeon pea monoculture; maize + Tamani guinea grass + Pigeon pea; maize + Qu & ecirc;nia guinea grass + Pigeon pea and maize + Zuri guinea grass + Pigeon pea. The results showed that maize silage intercropped with cultivars of Panicum maximum (Tamani, Qu & ecirc;nia and Zuri guinea grasses) and Pigeon pea increased silage mass production by 37.8% and the crude protein content at 25.1% compared with that of the monoculture maize silage. It also improved the fermentation characteristics of silage, reducing 5.1% of pH, 32.5% of buffering capacity, 28.9% of ammoniacal nitrogen in total nitrogen, 15.7% of effluent production, and 20.0% of dry matter losses, compared with those of grass and legume silage in monoculture. Thus, the silage produced by the triple intercropping proved to be an efficient technique for sustainable forage production.

AB  - The number of food systems education programs and curricula in the U.S. has increased in response to the growing interest in where food comes from and how it is grown. While these educational efforts aim to increase learners' connection to food and the land, they do not always focus explicitly on the structural inequities that shape food systems and the experiences of food workers. There is, however, a small but growing number of food systems education programs that seek to shed light on and challenge these inequities. We build on these existing critical approaches to food systems education by introducing the notion of critical food literacy-or the ability to examine one's assumptions, grapple with multiple perspectives and values that underlie the food system, understand the larger sociopolitical contexts that shape the food system, and take action toward creating just, sustainable food systems. In particular, we discuss and highlight the potential of multicultural texts to make visible food workers, especially those who tend to be less visible, and identify pedagogical strategies for cultivating critical food literacy by drawing on empirical research on response to multicultural literature and using a multicultural text produced by the Food Chain Workers Alliance as an illustrative example. Ultimately, we argue that citizens who develop and demonstrate critical food literacy can participate in public, democratic discourse about food systems and help create food systems that are just and sustainable for all.

AB  - Mowing is one of the most important methods used to control weeds in organic farming, under the no-tillage system. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of three weed management techniques on weed development, using the weeds Bidens pilosa and Commelina benghalensis, in competition with organic corn {mowing at the three-leaf stage (14 days after corn emergence - DACE), mowing at the three-and six-leaf stage (14 and 25 DACE), and no mowing. Single cultivation with no mowing was also evaluated for these weeds. Mowings performed at 14 and 25 DACE prevented the production of B. pilosa seeds, ensuring efficient control of this species. However, the use of this technique was shown to be inefficient in the control of C. benghalensis.

AB  - Assessment tools are needed to evaluate the effect of farming practices on soil health, as there is increasing interest from growers to improve the health of their soils. However, there is limited information on the efficacy of different soil health indicators on commercial farms and perhaps less so on organic farms. To assess efficacy, three organic growers in cooperation with the Ecological Farmers Association of Ontario's Farmer-Led Research Program tested management sensitivity, measurement repeatability, and consistency of interpretation of different soil health indicators. On each farm, we compared permanganate-oxidizable carbon (active carbon), organic matter, wet aggregate stability, phospholipid fatty acid analysis, Haney soil health test, and Haney nutrient test on one field of grower-perceived high productivity, one field of grower- perceived low productivity, and one reference site (undisturbed, permanent cover). Our results were consistent with previous research that showed grower perception of productivity and soil health associated with management- sensitive soil health indicators. Of the indicators tested, active carbon was the only indicator that was sensitive, repeatable, and consistent across the three farms, and soil organic matter was highly repeatable and consistent to detect differences greater than 0.5% organic matter. This study highlights differences among soil health indicators on commercial farms, and it concludes that active carbon and organic matter were the most useful soil health indicators for these organic farms. Participating growers intend to use results to benchmark current soil status and to help guide land management decisions towards improved soil health.

AB  - Resource degradation has a profound influence on food sustainability of developing economies. The breakdown of traditional institutions enhanced this problem and needs an institutional approach. Many of the traditional policies, like regulation and taxation, have failed to deliver the required benefits. This paper uses Principal-Agency theory to develop a criterion for incentive design. Three incentive structures are developed based on contractual agreements and restructured property rights that use the criterion. Two case studies were used to discuss the new institutional arrangement. Some practical implications of the mechanisms designed include linearity of incentive rules, development of an effort-reward matrix, and gradual reinstatement of local governance.

AB  - Maintaining the health, and therefore productivity, of agricultural soils is vital for continued sustainable agricultural production to support the world's growing population. Potatoes are grown in a variety of agro-ecological systems and are one of the most important food crops worldwide. Potato crops are demanding on the soil with significant heavy machinery traffic, intensive tillage operations and high inputs of fertiliser, pesticides and water. Maintaining or improving soil health can therefore be challenging for growers. This review considers the different aspects of soil health in a potato production context, how to measure them and how they can be influenced by management practices. Soil health is a complex concept encompassing the physical, chemical and biological properties of the soil and their role in ecosystem services and the growth of plants. Although our understanding of soil health and its impact on crop productivity has improved in the last 30 years, many knowledge gaps remain.

AB  - Emerging economies, e.g. India, China and Brazil etc., face challenges to adopt food safety (FS) practices in their food supply chains. Considering food industry's operations and processes, this study identifies 25 challenges to the FS initiatives involving the opinions of practitioners from six major Indian food producers and academic experts. The challenges are grouped into five categories, viz. organisational, government and policy, global, knowledge and financial. We identify the best and worst challenges to the FS initiatives along with causality among them using combined Best Worst Method (BWM) and 'Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory' (DEMATEL) approaches. BWM prioritises these challenges, while DEMATEL identifies causal relationship maps for the prioritised challenges. The BWM results demonstrate that the government and policy related challenges are the key challenges followed by the organisational, global, knowledge and financial related challenges. The DEMATEL results exhibit the organisational, government and policy, and global related challenges as the cause group challenges. The knowledge and financial related challenges represent the effect group challenges. Mitigation of these challenges inherently necessitates stakeholders' involvement in the food supply chains. We identify constructs for food safety initiatives policy in the emerging economies to raise public awareness while encouraging greater collaboration and efficiency in food supply chains to help achieve the second Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) for securing food for everyone. The results of the study offer guidance and deeper insights to supply chain managers about synergy requirements between the government policymakers and key players of the industry in the emerging economies.

AB  - Households combine capital assets in a process involving human agency and resourcefulness to construct livelihood strategies and generate well-being outcomes. Here, we (1) characterized types of livelihood strategies; (2) determined how different capital assets are associated with different livelihood strategies; and (3) determined how livelihood strategies differed in food security outcomes. We conducted a survey in southwestern Ethiopia and used principal component and cluster analyses. Five types of livelihood strategies, which differed mainly in food and cash crops comprising the strategy, were identified. These were, in order of decreasing food security: three food crops, coffee and khat', n=68; three food crops and khat', n=59; two food crops, coffee and khat', n=78; two food crops and khat', n=88; and one food crop, coffee and khat', n=44. The livelihood strategy three food crops, coffee and khat' was associated with a wide range of capital assets, particularly having larger aggregate farm field size and learning from other farmers. A generalized linear model showed that livelihood strategies were significantly associated with food security outcomes. Particularly, a high number of food crops in a strategy was linked with relatively high food security. In this context, diversified livelihood strategies primarily through having a mix of food crops for subsistence, in combination with cash crops for income, are important for food security. This suggests a need to rethink dominant policy narratives, which have a narrow focus on increasing productivity and commercialization as the primary pathway to food security.

AB  - Food security among migrants and refugees is a concern across the globe, with the dearth of evidence on food labels and their influence on food security affecting disadvantaged communities especially. This paper discusses the experiences of food security among Libyan migrant families in Australia. The study is situated within the food and nutrition security framework. A qualitative approach was adopted with in-depth interviews conducted with 27 Libyan migrants. Thematic analysis identified three themes: food security, food label comprehension, and strategies for dealing with food insecurity and food labelling difficulties. Food security had different meanings to different individuals. Access to culturally appropriate (halal) foods was problematic for families in regional and rural areas due to a lack of availability outside the main cities. In terms of food labelling, the language and terms used were a common issue for most families in both rural and city environments. Many families attempted to find ways to counteract food insecurity; however, lower-income families found this more burdensome. It is crucial that health and social welfare providers consider means to reduce food insecurity among Libyan migrants to allow them to live a healthier life in Australia.

AB  - In Western countries, a behavioural shift towards more plant-based diets is helpful in protecting population and planet health. School canteens are an important public policy target to achieve this transition. Increasing the frequency of vegetarian meals in school canteens has been proposed as a solution to decrease greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining a good nutritional quality. However, vegetarian meals acceptance by children is key to limit unintended consequences such as increased food waste or increased nutritional inequalities. We aimed to examine children's liking for vegetarian and non-vegetarian main dishes at school canteens; and whether it varied across socioeconomic level. Connected scoring devices displaying a five-point smiley scale were installed in all the 38 primary school canteens of a French city, located in socially diverse neighbourhoods. Every day after their school lunch, children were asked to rate the main dish they had just eaten. During one school year, from September 2021 to June 2022, we collected 208,985 votes for 125 main dishes, including 32 vegetarian (i.e., no meat or fish) and 93 non-vegetarian dishes, for an average of 1672 (SD 440) votes per day across the 38 school canteens. We showed no difference in children's liking for vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. Additionally, the socioeconomic level of the schools was found to interact negatively with children's liking for vegetarian main dishes whereby vegetarian main dishes tended to be more liked in schools of lower socioeconomic level. In this French city, children's acceptance would not be a barrier to increase the frequency of vegetarian school meals and would not increase social dietary inequalities.

AB  - Maximum entropy (ME) techniques are used to jointly estimate the share equations of a multi-output restricted profit function and the impact of technology and policy biases in post-war UK agriculture. Total factor productivity (TFP) and policy change dummies are included, to take account of technical change and recent CAP reforms. ME provides an attractive means of circumventing estimation difficulties associated with ill-posed or over parameterised specifications. The model provides evidence of factor saving biases for Land, Labour and Feed inputs and output augmentation for Crop and Horticultural products. Recent EU agricultural policy changes appear to have had a significant biasing impact on profit shares. However, early attempts at partial decoupling appear to have fallen short of expectations.

AB  - Mealybugs (Pseudococcidae) are widely distributed insects that damage a large variety of fruits, vegetables and other crops throughout the world. The soft and thin-skinned fig (Ficus carica L.) is nutritious and tasty. Additionally, these fruits have enormous medicinal potential. Organic farming for the production of fresh figs is in demand. This experiment was designed to determine effective, economic and organic agents to control mealybug infestation on fig orchards. Jatropha (Jatropha curcas) leaf extract, neem (Azadirachta indica) leaf extract and malathion were applied to selected groups of plants at 7, 15, 30, 45 and 60-days intervals and the mealybug densities measured after treatment. Three species (Phenacoccus solenopsis Tinsley, Pseudococcus longispinus (Targioni Tozzetti) and Planococcus ficus (Signoret)) of mealybugs were morphologically identified from experimental fig orchards. Both botanicals and malathion showed an inhibitory effect on mealybugs. The effectiveness against the mealybugs was Malathion > Jatropha leaf extract > Neem leaf extract. Nine biologically active compounds were identified from an LC-MS/MS (Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry) analysis of Jatropha leaf extract that appear to have insecticidal properties against the mealybugs. We recommend applications of either Jatropha or Neem leaf extracts to fig orchards to control mealybugs every 15 to 30 days.

AB  - This paper addresses women's empowerment in agriculture, innovations in its measurement, and emerging evidence. We discuss the evolution of the conceptualization and measurement of women's empowerment and gender equality since 2010. Using a gender and food systems framework and a standardized measure of women's empowerment, the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI), we review the evidence on "what works" to empower women based on impact evaluations of a portfolio of 11 agricultural development projects with empowerment objectives and a scoping review of livestock interventions. We then review the evidence on associations between empowering women and societal benefits-agricultural productivity, incomes, and food security and nutrition. We conclude with recommendations for measurement and policy.

AB  - Climate change has devastating effects on plant growth and yield. During ontogenesis, plants are subjected to a variety of abiotic stresses, including drought and salinity, affecting the crop loss (20-50%) and making them vulnerable in terms of survival. These stresses lead to the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that damage nucleic acid, proteins, and lipids. Plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) have remarkable capabilities in combating drought and salinity stress and improving plant growth, which enhances the crop productivity and contributes to food security. PGPB inoculation under abiotic stresses promotes plant growth through several modes of actions, such as the production of phytohormones, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase, exopolysaccharide, siderophore, hydrogen cyanide, extracellular polymeric substances, volatile organic compounds, modulate antioxidants defense machinery, and abscisic acid, thereby preventing oxidative stress. These bacteria also provide osmotic balance; maintain ion homeostasis; and induce drought and salt-responsive genes, metabolic reprogramming, provide transcriptional changes in ion transporter genes, etc. Therefore, in this review, we summarize the effects of PGPB on drought and salinity stress to mitigate its detrimental effects. Furthermore, we also discuss the mechanistic insights of PGPB towards drought and salinity stress tolerance for sustainable agriculture.

AB  - The term "phytotechnologies" refers to the application of science and engineering to provide solutions involving plants, including phytoremediation options using plants and associated microbes to remediate environmental compartments contaminated by trace elements (TE) and organic xenobiotics (OX). An extended knowledge of the uptake, translocation, storage, and detoxification mechanisms in plants, of the interactions with microorganisms, and of the use of "omic" technologies (functional genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics), combined with genetic analysis and plant improvement, is essential to understand the fate of contaminants in plants and food, nonfood and technical crops. The integration of physicochemical and biological understanding allows the optimization of these properties of plants, making phytotechnologies more economically and socially attractive, decreasing the level and transfer of contaminants along the food chain and augmenting the content of essential minerals in food crops. This review will disseminate experience gained between 2004 and 2009 by three working groups of COST Action 859 on the uptake, detoxification, and sequestration of pollutants by plants and consequences for food safety. Gaps between scientific approaches and lack of understanding are examined to suggest further research and to clarify the current state-of-the-art for potential end-users of such green options. Phytotechnologies potentially offer efficient and environmentally friendly solutions for cleanup of contaminated soil and water, improvement of food safety, carbon sequestration, and development of renewable energy sources, all of which contribute to sustainable land use management. Information has been gained at more realistic exposure levels mainly on Cd, Zn, Ni, As, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and herbicides with less on other contaminants. A main goal is a better understanding, at the physiological, biochemical, and molecular levels, of mechanisms and their regulation related to uptake-exclusion, apoplastic barriers, xylem loading, efflux-influx of contaminants, root-to-shoot transfer, concentration and chemical speciation in xylem/phloem, storage, detoxification, and stress tolerance for plants and associated microbes exposed to contaminants (TE and OX). All remain insufficiently understood especially in the case of multiple-element and mixed-mode pollution. Research must extend from model species to plants of economic importance and include interactions between plants and microorganisms. It remains a major challenge to create, develop, and scale up phytotechnologies to market level and to successfully deploy these to ameliorate the environment and human health.

AB  - Soil microorganisms are sensitive to environment disturbances, and such alterations have consequences on microbial diversity and functions. Our hypothesis is that alpha diversity of microbial communities and functional diversity decrease from undisturbed to disturbed soils, with consequences for functional redundancy in the soil ecosystem. To test this hypothesis, we used soil DNA shotgun metagenomics approach to assess the soil microbiome in a chronosequence of land-use from a native tropical forest, followed by deforestation and cultivation of soybean croplands and pasture in different seasons. Agriculture and pasture soils were among the most diverse and presented higher functional redundancy, which is important to maintain the ecosystem functioning after the forest conversion. On the other hand, the ecosystem equilibrium in forest is maintained based on a lower alpha diversity but higher abundance of microorganisms. Our results indicate that land-use change alters the structure and composition of microbial communities; however, ecosystem functionality is overcome by different strategies based on the abundance and diversity of the communities.

AB  - Soil nitrogen cycling is intricately related to soil physicochemical properties, enzymatic activity, and microbial vitality. Biochar, containing various elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, possesses a porous structure with strong adsorption capabilities. This characteristic renders it useful for ameliorating acidic soils, influencing soil nitrogen cycling, and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. To quantitatively analyze the diverse impacts of different biochar on soil nitrogen cycling and to highlight its implications for sustainable agriculture, this study collected 155 relevant articles and conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis. The results indicate that biochar can elevate the pH by 4.60% for acidic soils and significantly increase soil organic carbon content by 64.60%. Different feedstocks, such as Wooden Biochar (WB), Crop Husk (CH) Biochar, Crop Straw Biochar (CS), and Organic Waste Biochar (OW), exhibit distinct effects, with WB and OW showing the most significant increases in SOC. Pyrolysis temperature is also a critical factor, and biochar produced at medium and high temperatures enhances pH more effectively than low-temperature biochar. Additionally, biochar enhances the abundance of the nitrogen functional gene amoA-AOB by 25.58%, promoting ammonia oxidation, reducing ammonia (NH3) emissions by 16.39%. Experimental setups also influence outcomes that biochar application in woods and incubation studies significantly reduced nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions compared to pot and field experiments. The findings suggest that adding biochar to soil accelerates nitrogen cycling, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The results advocate biochar's use in sustainable soil management practices. Biochar elevates soil pH by 4.57%, mitigating NH3 and N2O losses under certain conditions.Biochar accelerates nitrogen cycling with 25.58% increase in amoA-AOB gene abundance.Significant boost (64.60%) in soil organic carbon, promoting fertility.

AB  - Ecophysiological models are widely used to forecast potential impacts of climate change on future agricultural productivity and to examine options for adaptation by local stakeholders and policy makers. However, protocols followed in such assessments vary to such an extent that they constrain cross-study syntheses and increase the potential for bias in projected impacts. We reviewed 221 peer-reviewed papers that used crop simulation models to examine diverse aspects of how climate change might affect agricultural systems. Six subject areas were examined: target crops and regions; the crop model(s) used and their characteristics; sources and application of data on [CO2] and climate; impact parameters evaluated; assessment of variability or risk; and adaptation strategies. Wheat, maize, soybean and rice were considered in approximately 170 papers. The USA (55 papers) and Europe (64 papers) were the dominant regions studied. The most frequent approach used to simulate response to CO2 involved adjusting daily radiation use efficiency (RUE) and transpiration, precluding consideration of the interacting effects of CO2, stomatal conductance and canopy temperature, which are expected to exacerbate effects of global warming. The assumed baseline [CO2] typically corresponded to conditions 10-30 years earlier than the date the paper was accepted, exaggerating the relative impacts of increased [CO2]. Due in part to the diverse scenarios for increases in greenhouse gas emissions, assumed future [CO2] also varied greatly. further complicating comparisons among studies. Papers considering adaptation predominantly examined changes in planting dates and cultivars; only 20 papers tested different tillage practices or crop rotations. Risk was quantified in over half the papers, mainly in relation to variability in yield or effects of water deficits, but the limited consideration of other factors affecting risk beside climate change per se suggests that impacts of climate change were overestimated relative to background variability. A coordinated crop, climate and soil data resource would allow researchers to focus on underlying science. More extensive model intercomparison, facilitated by modular software, should strengthen the biological realism of predictions and clarify the limits of our ability to forecast agricultural impacts of climate change on crop production and associated food security as well as to evaluate potential for adaptation.

AB  - The agricultural sector plays a crucial role in the world economy and in the increasing population. The decrease of crop yield and productivity by fungal infestation is one of the main concerns in agriculture. Synthetic fungicides are effective against several fungal infestations. However, although the tremendous use of synthetic fungicides to obtain high production yield has helped to cope with the growing population, it is gradually contaminating the ecosystem. Chemical fungicides have raised major concerns regarding environmental sustainability, human health, and increased resistance in fungal strains. Therefore, there is a need for a safer and more sustainable alternative. Microalgae provide a clean and sustainable solution to this emerging problem. Microalgal extracts have been reported to be a potent bio-fungicide. This review explores the efficiency, uses, and environmental advantages of using microalgal extracts as bio-fungicide. The composition of microalgal extract contains many antifungal and antimicrobial chemicals that can be used as an eco-friendly bio-fungicide. Furthermore, microalgal extracts can contribute to sustainable agriculture practices by reducing the dependence on chemical fungicides.

AB  - Land-use change significantly impacts soil micro-nutrients distribution and transformations due to their inefficient scale- and location-specific management in different ecosystems. We studied the changes in micro-nutrients (viz. Zn, Cu, Fe and Mn) availability and their transformations in soils of hilly landscapes under five distinct land-use systems including mono cropping, double cropping, agroforestry, orchards and the vegetable crops to explore relationship between different fractions of variable solubility and their mobility in response to land-use change. Among the compared land-use systems, DTPA-Zn, Fe, Mn and Cu comprised similar to 3.0 to 8.2%, similar to 0.21 to 0.35%, similar to 1.2 to 6.3% and similar to 7.6 to 17.5% of their respective total content in soils. The agroforestry system had significantly (p < 0.05) higher DTPA-Zn and Mn, compared with mono-and double cropping system. However, the orchard soils had similar to 2.1, 2.0 and 3.4-times higher DTPA-Zn, Fe and Cu concentration than the agroforestry system. The agroforestry system was distinct with significantly highest proportion of total Cu retrieved as amorphous oxide bound (similar to 20.5%), crystalline oxide bound (similar to 33.6%), organic matter bound (similar to 2.1%), while the lowest proportion was accumulated as residual form (similar to 43.8%), compared with the other studied land-use systems. The mobility factor that explicit micro-nutrient transformations among soluble and stable pool revealed that monocropping had the significantly lowest (similar to 3.3%), while the agroforestry system had the highest Zn mobility factor (similar to 4.9%). On the other hand, agroforestry system had significantly lowest (similar to 1.8%), while the soils under vegetable crops had the highest Mn mobility factor (similar to 7.5%). The principle component analysis (PCA) elucidated residual micro-nutrient (Zn, Fe and Mn) fraction as significant contributors to discern land-use change in fragile hilly landscapes. These results highlight the importance of micro-nutrients management through robust interventions for long-term sustainability different land-use systems in a cold high altitude Himalayan mountainous region.

AB  - Micronutrient malnutrition is a challenge for women of reproductive age, who are particularly vulnerable due to greater micronutrient needs. The minimum dietary diversity for women (MDD-W) indicator is a micronutrient adequacy's proxy for those women, but little is known about its relation to other dimensions. We assessed MDD-W and its association with other socioeconomic, food security and purchasing practices in urban Burkina Faso. We conducted multi-stage cluster sampling in two main cities of Burkina Faso, stratified by type of district, and interviewed 12 754 women in the 2009-2011 period. We obtained food consumption data through unquantified 24 hour recalls and computed MDD-W as consuming at least five out of ten predefined food groups. We constructed multivariable regression models with sociodemographic and food security covariates. MDD-W in urban Burkina Faso was 31%, higher in Ouagadougou (33%) than in Bobo-Dioulasso (29%), and lower in unstructured districts. The most frequently consumed food groups were 'all starchy', 'vitamin A rich dark green leafy vegetables' and 'other vegetables'. Household's expenses were associated with higher likelihood of MDD-W, while the association with household food security indicators varied by year and type of district. Purchasing foods in markets and choosing the place of purchase based on large choice rather than proximity showed a positive association with the MDD-W. Only one in three women in urban Burkina Faso reached the minimum dietary diversity, and although socioeconomic and food security variables had the greatest effect on MDD-W, purchasing practices, like going to the market, also showed a positive effect.

AB  - Emissions from agriculture-driven deforestation are of global concern, but forest land-sparing interventions such as agricultural intensification and utilization of available non-forest land offer opportunities for mitigation. In many tropical countries, where agriculture is the major driver of deforestation, interventions in the agriculture sector could reduce deforestation emissions as well as reduce emissions in the agriculture sector. Our study uses a novel approach to quantify agriculture-driven deforestation and associated emissions in the tropics between 2000 and 2010. Emissions from agriculture-driven deforestation in the tropics (97 countries) are 4.3 GtCO(2)e yr(-1). We investigate the national potential to mitigate these emissions through forest land-sparing interventions, which can potentially be implemented under REDD+. We consider intensification and utilization of available non-forested land as forest land-sparing opportunities since they avoid the expansion of agriculture into forested land. In addition, we assess the potential to reduce agricultural emissions on existing agriculture land. The use of a systematic framework demonstrates the selection of mitigation interventions by considering sequentially the level of emissions, mitigation potential of various interventions, enabling environment and associated risks to livelihoods at the national level. Our results show that considering only countries with high emissions from agriculture-driven deforestation, with potential for forest-sparing interventions and a good enabling environment (e.g. effective governance or engagement in REDD+),there is a potential to mitigate 1.3 GtCO(2)e yr(-1) (20 countries of 78 with sufficient data). For countries where we identify agricultural emissions as a priority for mitigation, up to 1 GtCO(2)e yr(-1) could be reduced from the agriculture sector including livestock. Risks to livelihoods from implementing interventions based on national level data call for detailed investigation at the local level to inform decisions on mitigation interventions. Three case studies demonstrate the use of the analytical framework. The inherent link between the agriculture and forestry sectors due to competition for land suggests that these sectors cannot be considered independently. Our findings highlight the need to include the forest and the agricultural sectors in the decision-making process to mitigate deforestation.

AB  - California is the leading dairy state in the United States, producing 21 % of the nation's milk supply. The state's highest concentration of dairies is in the San Joaquin Valley, a region that violates federal limits for ozone and particulate matter in the air. Volatile organic compounds and greenhouse-gas emissions from dairies contribute to regional air-quality challenges and also play a role in climate change. We used an environmentally controlled chamber to monitor greenhouse-gas emissions from dairy cattle over a 24-hour period, and we measured the emissions from waste slurry using a simulated dairy waste lagoon. This research helps to quantify emissions from dairies in California and suggests possible approaches for their mitigation.

AB  - Biofuels production has increased rapidly in recent years due to higher petroleum prices as well as heightened concerns regarding climate change and energy security. However, because commercially viable biofuels are currently produced primarily from agricultural feedstocks, higher production volumes increase pressure on land resources. Thus, large-scale biofuels production has important implications for the forest and agriculture sectors, land use, trade, and net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Competition for land is expected to continue growing in the future as mandated biofuels volumes increase along with rising demand for food, feed, and fiber, both domestically and internationally. In response to heightened concern regarding impacts such as indirect land-use change and higher food prices, the U.S. policy is focusing on second-generation (cellulosic) feedstocks to contribute the majority of the mandated increase in biofuels volume through 2022. However, there has been little work exploring the logistics of supplying these feedstocks or examining feedstock mix and net GHG effects of combining renewable fuels mandates with climate policy. In this paper, we apply the recently updated Forest and Agricultural Sector Optimization Model with GHGs (FASOMGHG) to explore the implications of alternative assumptions regarding feedstock storage costs and carbon price for renewable energy production mix, land use, and net GHG emissions. The model is used to quantify the magnitude and regional distribution of changes in the optimal mix of bioenergy feedstocks when accounting for storage costs. In addition, we find that combining the biofuels volume mandate with a carbon price policy has additional implications for feedstock mix and provides a substantially larger net reduction in GHG than a renewable fuels mandate alone.

AB  - This study aims to understand how Rwandan farmers value the improved characteristics of climate services introduced to them in a choice experiment setting. Data were collected from 1,525 household heads in November 2019. A random parameters logit model was used to analyze the data. Results suggest that Rwandan farmers value forecast accuracy, dissemination through a combination of extension agents and the Participatory Integrated Climate Services for Agriculture process, and bundling with market price information. This study suggests that to improve agricultural management planning and food security of farmers through the provision of climate services, these services need to be accurate, user-tailored, and accessible.

AB  - In recent decades, meat consumption has increased globally due to increased incomes. A consequence of increased red meat consumption has been the rise in greenhouse gas emissions and nutrition-related diseases. Consumption of antibiotic-free (ABF) poultry meat is a viable healthy and sustainable substitute that will cause less damage to humans and the environment in the long run. This study was undertaken due to the increasing importance of healthy food consumption to preventing nutrition-related diseases. The health food industry is still in its preliminary stages; for market development of organic broiler meat and movement toward sustainable production of ABF meat, the first necessary step is conducting empirical research on ABF poultry meat consumption and identifying factors that influence household consumption patterns of ABF poultry meat. Therefore, the objectives of this study were the investigation of factors affecting poultry meat consumption by consumers and ABF poultry meat preference. Comparing the results could reveal what percentage of consumers are able to buy healthier higher-priced antibiotic-free poultry meat. Data were collected from 360 completed questionnaires completed by households from the city of Mashhad, Iran via simple random sampling in 2021. To investigate the first objective, an ordered logit model was used. The results showed that age, the head of household's education, awareness of the nutritional benefits of poultry meat, advertising, and family income were statistically significant determinants of poultry meat consumption. To investigate the second objective, since some consumers cannot buy ABF poultry meat due to the higher prices, we used a two-step Heckman model. The results showed that the awareness of the nutritional benefits of ABF poultry meat, the head of household's education, monthly family income, and advertising had positive impacts, with prices having a negative impact on the amount of antibiotic-free poultry meat consumed by the households. Comparing the results of the two models revealed that only about 30% of consumers could buy ABF poultry meat, mainly due to the higher prices. This study recommends improving consumer awareness, targeted distribution of ABF poultry meat according to customers' economic and demographic characteristics, affordable prices, and appropriate marketing tools for sustainable consumption of ABF poultry meat.

AB  - Significant greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions from all sectors of human enterprise are necessary to avoid further effects and reduce the current effects of climate change. Agriculture and the global food system are estimated to contribute to one-third of all anthropogenic GHGs. In British Columbia, Canada, mandated GHG reduction targets and voluntary climate action programs are challenging local governments to include emission reduction targets, policies, and actions within official planning documents. At this early stage of GHG reductions, local government attention does not yet include agriculture but is directed toward the transportation, buildings, and waste management sectors. Given agriculture's contribution to GHG emissions and local government's engagement with GHG mitigation and food system planning, it seems reasonable to anticipate that over time, local governments should and will engage increasingly in reducing GHGs from agriculture. With the goal of advancing agriculture GHG mitigation by local governments, this paper reviews the jurisdictional powers governing agriculture and climate change within British Columbia. It examines how local governments can support mitigation within the sector through their roles in planning, policy, programming, and public engagement, and identifies potential research agenda items.

AB  - Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) is an approach that identifies actions needed to transform and reorganize agricultural systems to effectively support agricultural development and ensure food security in the face of climate change. In this study, we assessed farmers' perception of climate change, available CSA practices (CSAP) and the determinants of CSAP adoption in northern Benin. A list of CSAP was generated from a workshop with different stakeholders. Face-to-face interviews were then carried out with 368 farmers selected based on stratified random sampling in the study area. Binomial generalized mixed-effect models were run to analyze the relation between socio-demographic characteristics and the use of CSAP. CSAP were evaluated using a three-point Likert scale and the frequency of agreement with the statement that the selected practices meet the pillars of CSA. More than 60% of farmers had heard about climate change, and more than 80% had observed changes in temperature, rainfall amounts and distribution. Thirty-one CSAP were identified in the area, and only 11 were known by more than 50% of farmers. Out of the 12 selected CSAP for the assessment of adoption and evaluation, seven (7) were used by more than 50% of those who knew them. Farmers agreed with the statements that the evaluated practices improved farm productivity and adaptation to climate change but did not mitigate climate change. Ethnic group and education level were the two major factors that significantly determined the use of the evaluated CSAP.

AB  - One-third of total CO2 emissions from deforestation in the 2000s took place in the Amazon region, in Brazil. This paper examines the effectiveness of a locally-led policy-the Green Municipalities Programme-in curbing illegal deforestation in the Para state, part of the legal Amazon. We combine a regression discontinuity (RD) design and a 10-year high-resolution spatial dataset (1,781,122 pixels covering 162,242 km(2)) to evaluate the programme's impact. Evidence suggests that municipalities reduced deforestation only 4 years after joining the programme at about 0.01 km(2) within the optional bandwidth (10 km). The effect comes mainly from municipalities traditionally with lower deforestation rates. This effect represents avoidance of 0.02 MtCO(2)/year released to the atmosphere, or USD 1.7 million per year of avoided damage. Since Brazil has committed through its NDC to eliminate deforestation in the Amazon by 2030, decentralized programmes focusing on indirect benefits appear to be effective only in the long run, serving as a "bonus" to support regions with relatively higher levels of forest cover.

AB  - The use of exclusion netting as an Integrated Pest Management technique is likely to become increasingly important as a means to increasing crop yields whilst minimising pesticide use. However, the increasing use of these nets will also lead to a rise in greenhouse gas emissions in the agricultural sector and pose problems related to their end-of-life disposal. Employing biopolymers made from low-carbon and renewable biomass feedstock to fabricate exclusion nets can potentially resolve these issues by merging the benefits of the two emerging technologies. Despite this, there has only been limited work on the use of biopolymer netting in agriculture. By looking at the challenges needed to be overcome for biopolymers to be widely used as a netting material, this review aims to bridge the gaps between the two fields of research. To do so, the past work done on agricultural netting is discussed, with a focus on the implemented materials and their desired properties. After this, potential candidate biopolymers for manufacturing agricultural nets are pointed out, emphasising their sustainability with respect to widely used Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) parameters, including the end-of-life treatment.

AB  - While food shortages have become an important challenge, providing safe food resources is a point of interest on a global scale. Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites that are formed through various fungi species. They are mainly spread through diets such as food or beverages. About one quarter of the world's food is spoiled with mycotoxins. As this problem is not resolved, it represents a significant threat to global food security. Besides the current concerns regarding the contamination of food items by these metabolites, the lack of knowledge by consumers and their possible growth and toxin production attracted considerable attention. While globalization provides a favorite condition for some countries, food security still is challenging for most countries. There are various approaches to reducing the mycotoxigenic fungi growth and formation of mycotoxins in food, include as physical, chemical, and biological processes. The current article will focus on collecting data regarding consumers' awareness of mycotoxins. Furthermore, a critical overview and comparison among different preventative approaches to reduce risk by consumers will be discussed. Finally, the current effect of mycotoxins on global trade, besides future challenges faced by mycotoxin contamination on food security, will be discussed briefly.

AB  - The number of people affected by disasters, including man -made ones, is on the rise globally, with rising food insecurity being one of the most critical impacts. Disasters, both sudden-onset and slow-onset ones, can cause disruptions to the production and transportation of agricultural commodities. Having the tools that can quantitatively assess the changes in agricultural commodity shipment volumes and their prices under disruptions caused by disaster scenarios is of major importance. In this paper, we utilize the theory of variational inequalities as the methodology to construct a multicommodity international agricultural trade network equilibrium model, which contains novel features of capacities on the production and transportation of multiple agricultural commodities to capture competition. The model includes exchange rates and accounts for multiple routes and possibly distinct transportation modes and combinations. Theoretical results are given and an algorithm is proposed. A series of numerical examples, both illustrative and algorithmically solved ones, inspired by Russia's war on Ukraine, highlight the effects of reduced production and transportation capacities on food security in the Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) countries of Lebanon and Egypt. We also include sensitivity analysis results for exchange rates. The solutions reveal insights into the importance of the production and transportation capacities regarding food security, along with having multiple transportation routes that are cost-efficient as well as the importance of the magnitude of exchange rates.

AB  - Food security is recognised as a multifaceted condition of complex causality, and given its broad definition, it is no surprise that food security eludes precise measurement. This study considers there to be three components of household food security (quantity, quality and stability), and attempts to address the concept-to-measurement gap in food security by building an index that spans these three dimensions. A panel data set from rural Zambia is used for descriptive analysis of food security indicators in 2001, 2004 and 2008. A multidimensional index of food security for rural Zambia is then developed using principal component analysis. We use this index to explore the spatial patterns of food security over time and to assess correlates of food security and impacts of climate shocks. Results indicate that both rainfall and temperature have a significant impact on a household's food security score, though not for each individual component of the index. The paper concludes with a discussion of the merits and shortcomings of developing a composite food security index.

AB  - The main goal of this article is to answer the question whether organic farming, which is developing in some parts of Poland, can be considered as a form of multifunctional farming and contribute so to non-commodity functions and the process of change in a particular territory of given areas. The analyses are based on data obtained from 2013 of several points in the south of Poland representing a cluster of organic market oriented farmers. The results show that namely market organic farming may serve as multifunctional one, but only under certain conditions and for a specific type of farming. Through specific functions, organic farming facilitates the changes, primarily on a local scale. The existence of a strong integrated organic farming sector might influences development and change, resulting in not only the improvement of economic welfare of organic farmers, but also of whole local communities, strengthening the bonds amongst them, mobilising the social resources.

AB  - Assessing soil quality marks the initial step in precision farming and agricultural management. Developing countries like Egypt face numerous hurdles in ensuring food security due to increasing populations and limited agricultural resources. A geographic information system (GIS) and multivariate analysis were utilized in the current work to evaluate and map a soil quality index (SQI). Moreover, the land suitability of the land for two plantations of the tree's oak (Quercus robur), and pine (Pinus silvestris), respectively was assessed using a parametric approach. A total of 82 soil profiles were selected to fulfill the objectives of the study. Based on the samples' PC scores, and agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC, the data was divided into two clusters: Cluster I and Cluster II, which collectively account for approximately 57% and 43% of the total data, respectively.. . The findings indicated that land suitability for planting Q. robur planted identified 2.14% of the research area as highly suitable (S1), 37.98% as moderately suitable (S2), and 59.89% as not suitable (N). Furthermore, the assessment of suitability for P. silvestris indicated that 50.88% of the investigated area was classified into: S1, 48.73% as S2, and 0.39% as N, which means it is not suitable for conservation activities. The research identified that soil depth beside excessive salinity and calcium carbonate as the primary soil constraints in the area in both clusters. The average soil depth, ECd and CaCO3 were 113.62 +/- 12.41, 17.27 +/- 10.23, 16.83 +/- 6.57 in Cluster 1 and 45.43 +/- 15.21, 22.42 +/- 12.43, 21.55 +/- 5.63 in Cluster II. The study demonstrates that integrating multivariate analysis with GIS enables a precise and streamlined assessment of the Soil Quality Index (SQI). Soil suitability modelling underscores the importance of implementing efficient management practices to attain agricultural sustainability in arid regions, particularly amidst intensive land utilization pressures

AB  - IntroductionThe war in Ukraine is causing significant disruption to global agri-food systems, which are still recovering from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In Australia, these global shocks followed a series of localized climate-induced crises from forest fires, floods and drought. There is a pressing need to increase our understanding of ways to strengthen the resilience of agri-food systems to multiple shocks and stresses that co-occur or follow on each other. The aims of this study in Melbourne, Australia, were to investigate how forest fire and pandemic shocks affected the agri-food system, to identify vulnerabilities in the system, and to explore opportunities to build resilience to future shocks and stresses. MethodsSemi-structured interviews were conducted during 2020-21 with 41 key stakeholders from government, industry and civil society organizations. Results and discussionVulnerabilities identified in agri-food supply chains included geographic and corporate concentration, complex "just in time" supply chains, critical infrastructure and logistics, and workforce availability. Strategies identified to build the resilience of agri-food systems include increasing the diversity of supply chains, decentralization, collaboration throughout agri-food supply chains, and ensuring sustainable livelihoods. ConclusionOur study highlights the cascading effects of multiple shocks and stresses on agri-food systems, and the need for greater policy focus on transformative actions that build the resilience of agri-food systems to any future shock, and that counter the cumulative effects of underlying environmental stresses.

AB  - Worldwide declines in fish stocks have a significant impact on the livelihoods of coastal fishing communities as jobs are lost and alternative forms of employment are limited. Mariculture (marine aquaculture) is considered by governments to be a viable solution to address unemployment and poverty in such communities. In Saldanha Bay, South Africa, the growing mussel and oyster industry has considerable potential for poverty alleviation, hence food security enhancement. In the first part of this study, we examine the potential ecological carrying capacity of the Bay to produce bivalves, and estimate the impact of this on employment creation should the sector's growth potential be fully realised. This growth potential could take the sector to 10 to 28 times its current size, providing direct employment for 940 to 2,500 people in the Saldanha area. Secondly, we assess five factors that affect the sustainable growth, development and employment creation potential of small-scale mariculture in South Africa and other countries. These are state support, markets, funding, the natural environment and the local community. Participants in the sector perceive its expansion potential to be hampered by regulatory issues such as incomplete implementation of a cohesive and accessible financial support policy, slow processing of mandatory samples required to monitor product safety, poor facilitation of access to international markets, price undercutting by imports subsidized in their countries of origin, and injuriously high lease fees for water levied by the parastatal harbour authority, coupled with lack of medium- and long-term lease tenure. The risk of environmental degradation from competing harbour use by large, fossil fuel and ore transport industries is of potential future concern.

AB  - IntroductionAcross sub-Sahara Africa, governments and international aid agencies are making huge investments in smallholder irrigation schemes to enhance food security, climate resilience and economic transformation in rain-fed farming systems. Unfortunately, a majority of the smallholder irrigation schemes have performed dismally on these fronts. Climate change is a major exacerbating factor to existing challenges resulting in the poor performance of the schemes. Hence, it is crucial to understand smallholder irrigators' perceptions of climate change and current adaptation strategies to co-design appropriate and acceptable adaptation strategies to address water stress in the schemes. This area had received less significant research attention. This study aims to determine the perception of climate change and coping strategies in smallholder schemes. MethodsA mixed-method research strategy was used to collect data from 317 irrigation scheme farmers in three schemes (Exchange, Insukamini, and Ruchanyu) in Midlands Province. A binary logistic regression (BLR) method was used for data analysis. ResultsThe results suggest that scheme farmers have noticed changes in temperature and rainfall patterns. Results obtained from the model show that climate change perception was mainly influenced by age, gender, location, irrigation experience, and plot size. Farmers perceived that climatic change has resulted in decreased irrigation water availability, thus leading to poor yields. This study also shows that the main adaptation strategies to water stress include improving soil moisture conservation, construction of small-scale reservoirs, water charging and trade, setting clear water use priorities, and adoption of climate-resilient and short-season crop varieties. Perception of high temperatures, long dry periods, late rainfall, increase in the frequency of drought, shortening of cold season, and shortening of rain season influence adaptation strategies adopted by scheme farmers. ConclusionThis study offered useful data for policymakers and irrigation developers to develop appropriate policies and programs to improve the sustainability of schemes given current and projected water stress in Zimbabwe and sub-Sahara Africa in general.

AB  - BackgroundLimited analysis has been conducted of the role of agricultural research in promoting Chinese agricultural growth in less-favored areas. This paper analyzes how a particular potato variety generates benefits to producers and discusses how these benefits may have contributed to poverty reduction in Yunnan province. Cooperation 88 (C88) is a high-yielding, late blight-resistant variety that was developed through a partnership between the International Potato Center and Yunnan Normal University in Kunming, China.MethodsQualitative and quantitative methods are used to analyze determinants of adoption of C88, and to estimate impacts of adoption on producer well-being. A unique farm-household database is used to document the determinants of C88 adoption and disadoption. The quantitative assessment is supplemented with a qualitative analysis of the potato value chain to understand how seed availability and concern for processing attributes contributed to and eventually constrained diffusion. Market-level information was used in an economic surplus model to quantify the substantial economic impact of C88 over 20 years since its release.ResultsC88 spread rapidly in Yunnan following its release and was widely adopted by commercially oriented farmers. Disadoption began after 2010 with limited seed availability driving the shift toward newer varieties. Farmers, however, appreciate the ease of marketing, the 15% higher yields, and late-blight resistance associated with C88 suggesting that seed constraints are countervailing the economic benefits of the variety. Total impact on Yunnan potato farmers of the variety was estimated to be around $2.5 billion for the 1996-2015 period.ConclusionsOn per-person terms among C88 growing farm households, the economic advantage of the variety is likely to have contributed to poverty reduction. The aggregate impact of C88 diffusion occurred during a period of rapid poverty reduction in Yunnan and yield and disease-resistance benefits of C88 likely contributed to this reduction.

AB  - Objective: The present study aimed to determine the relationship among food insecurity, social support and mental well-being in sub-Saharan Africa, a region presenting the highest prevalence of severe food insecurity and a critical scarcity of mental health care. Design: Food insecurity was measured using the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES). Social support was assessed using dichotomous indicators of perceived, foreign perceived, received, given, integrative and emotional support. The Negative and Positive Experience Indices (NEI and. PEI) were used as indicators of mental well-being. Multilevel mixed-effect linear models were applied to examine the associations between mental well-being and food security status, social support and their interaction, respectively, accounting for random effects at country level and covariates. Participants: Nationally representative adults surveyed through Gallup World Poll between 2014 and 2016 in thirty-nine sub-Saharan African countries (n 102 235). Results: The prevalence of severe food insecurity was 39%. The prevalence of social support ranged from 30 to 72% by type. In the pooled analysis using the adjusted model, food insecurity was dose-responsively associated with increased NEI and decreased PEI. Perceived, integrative and emotional support were associated with lower NEI and higher PEI. The differences in NEI and PEI between people with and without social support were the greatest among the most severely food insecure. Conclusions: Both food insecurity lack of social support c onstitY to sources of vulnerability to poor mental well-being. Social support appears to modify the relationship between food security and mental well-being among those most affected by food insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa.

AB  - In the face of the devastating implementation of corporative agri-food systems, processes of re-territorialization driven by agroecology, such as peasant resistance, become particularly relevant. In this article, we examine the history of the organization La Alianza (The Alliance) in Lara, Venezuela from 1975 to 2020, as narrated by its members, and using the methodology of the systematization of experiences. Based on the analytical categories of agroecology, territory and intersubjectivities, we reconstruct trajectories and organization, identifying harmonious moments which as in the case of a symphony orchestra are triggers for social processes that have promoted the constitution of specific territories. We conclude by showing the possibility of an alternative existence to hegemonic structures, constructed by collective, organized, and conscious subjects that are the driving force behind territories. Frente a la devastadora implementaci & oacute;n de los sistemas agroalimentarios corporativos, los procesos de reterritorializaci & oacute;n impulsados por la agroecolog & iacute;a como, por ejemplo, la resistencia campesina, cobran especial relevancia. Este art & iacute;culo analiza la historia de la organizaci & oacute;n La Alianza en Lara, Venezuela, desde 1975 hasta 2020, narrada por sus miembros y utilizando la metodolog & iacute;a de la sistematizaci & oacute;n de experiencias. Reconstruimos trayectorias y el proceso de organizaci & oacute;n a partir de categor & iacute;as anal & iacute;ticas pertenecientes a la agroecolog & iacute;a, el territorio y las intersubjetividades, identificando momentos de armon & iacute;a que, al igual que en el caso de una orquesta sinf & oacute;nica, han sido detonantes de procesos sociales a favor de la constituci & oacute;n de territorios espec & iacute;ficos. Concluimos mostrando la posibilidad de una existencia alternativa a las estructuras hegem & oacute;nicas-una alternativa construida por sujetos colectivos, organizados y conscientes capaces de fungir como la fuerza motriz del territorio.

AB  - Global concerns about food security, driven by rising demand, have prompted the exploration of nanotechnology as a solution to enhance food supply. This shift comes in response to the limitations of conventional technologies in meeting the ever-increasing demand for food products. Consequently, nanoparticles play a crucial role in enhancing food production, preservation, and extending shelf life by imparting exceptional properties to materials. Nanoparticles and nanostructures with attributes like expansive surface area and antimicrobial efficacy, are versatile in both traditional packaging and integration into biopolymer matrices. These distinctive qualities contribute to their extensive use in various food sector applications. Hence, this review explores the physicochemical properties, functions, and biological aspects of nanoparticles in the context of food packaging. Furthermore, the synergistic effect of nanoparticles with different biopolymers, alongside its different potential applications such as food shelf-life extenders, antimicrobial agents and as nanomaterials for developing smart packaging systems were summarily explored. While the ongoing exploration of this research area is evident, our review highlights the substantial potential of nanomaterials to emerge as a viable choice for food packaging if the challenges regarding toxicity are carefully and effectively modulated. Global concerns about food security, driven by rising demand, have prompted the exploration of nanotechnology as a solution to enhance food supply.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NBS) have been promoted as a holistic way to solve a variety of societal issues while benefiting biodiversity at the same time. To date, applications of NBS approaches that help ensure food security have yet been systematically reviewed. In this paper, we critically review the specific NBS for food security, highlighting their limitations, to provide recommendations that promote their applications for improving global food security. We accessed and evaluated publications on four different scholastic databases, and our systematic review of relevant materials indicated that many NBS approaches can be applied to enhance food security dimensions individually or together. However, there is a strong bias towards food availability, and not enough research has been done to link NBS with improvements in food access and utilization. Over 80 % of the reviewed papers were of short-term studies or without specific time- frames, and 25 % offered no information on the economic effectiveness of NBS. Environmental benefits of NBS were explicitly described in about 60 % of these papers, and biodiversity enhancement was measured in only about 10 %. We, therefore, recommend future applications of NBS to safeguard food security be shifted to food access and utilization with careful consultation with local communities to address their specific context, using indicators that are easily measured and managed. Systematic monitoring regimes and robust and diversified financial support systems are also equally important in efforts to successfully implement NBS. Moreover, environmental and societal benefits, especially water productivity and biodiversity, must be incorporated into the planning and design of NBS.

AB  - Estimates of genetic parameters for organic dairy farming have not been published previously, and neither is information available on the magnitude of genotype by environment interaction ( G x E) between organic and conventional farming. However, organic farming is growing worldwide and basic information about genetic parameters is needed for future breeding strategies for organic dairy farming. The goal of this study was to estimate heritabilities of milk production traits under organic farming conditions and to estimate the magnitude of G x E between organic and conventional dairy farming. For this purpose, production records of first-parity Holstein heifers were used. Heritabilities of milk, fat and protein yield, and somatic cell score (SCS) were higher under organic farming conditions. For percentages of fat and protein, heritabilities of organic and conventional production were very similar. Genetic correlations between preorganic and organic, and organic and conventional milk production were 0.79 and 0.80, respectively. For fat yield, these correlations were 0.86 and 0.88, and for protein yield, these were 0.78 and 0.71, respectively. Our findings indicate that moderate G x E was present for yield traits. For percentage of fat and protein and SCS, genetic correlations between organic and conventional and preorganic production were close to unity, indicating that there was no G x E for these traits.

AB  - El Nino events typically lead to delayed rainfall and decreased rice planting in Indonesia's main rice-growing regions, thus prolonging the hungry season and increasing the risk of annual rice deficits. Here we use a risk assessment framework to examine the potential impact of El Nino events and natural variability on rice agriculture in 2050 under conditions of climate change, with a focus on two main rice-producing areas: Java and Bali. We select a 30-day delay in monsoon onset as a threshold beyond which significant impact on the country's rice economy is likely to occur. To project the future probability of monsoon delay and changes in the annual cycle of rainfall, we use output from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AR4 suite of climate models, forced by increasing greenhouse gases, and scale it to the regional level by using empirical downscaling models. Our results reveal a marked increase in the probability of a 30-day delay in monsoon onset in 2050,as a result of changes in the mean climate,from 9-18% today (depending on the region) to 30-40% at the upper tail of the distribution. Predictions of the annual cycle of precipitation suggest an increase in precipitation later in the crop year (April-June) of approximate to 10% but a substantial decrease (up to 75% at the tail) in precipitation later in the dry season (July-September). These results indicate a need for adaptation strategies in Indonesian rice agriculture, including increased investments in water storage, drought-tolerant crops, crop diversification, and early warning systems.

AB  - This was a cross-sectional study conducted in the first Millennium Village in Western Kenya. We compared the food security status of households affected by HIV/AIDS to households not affected by HIV/AIDS. We also identified coping strategies adopted by members of food insecure households. 315 Households were included in the study, consisting of 169 HIV affected households, (44 households with self-identified HIV positive adults, 80 households with orphans, and 45 households with both orphans and self-identified HIV positive adults). These households were compared to 146 HIV unaffected households. Food security status was measured using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale Indicator (HFIAS) guide. Coping strategies were measured using the Coping Strategies Index (CSI). HIV affected households had a significantly higher food insecurity score 11.11, compared to 9.53 in HIV unaffected households (p = 0.037). Female headed households had the worst food security, regardless of household type. There were also significant difference in the coping strategies scores between HIV affected (64.48) and unaffected households (50.31) (p = 0.004). HIV affected households were associated with more severe coping strategies. The food security of HIV affected households is compromised by a variety of factors including the synergy generated by hosting a HIV positive family member and orphans. The gender of the household head is also an important consideration. Households headed by women tend to be more vulnerable, predisposing households to greater food insecurity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper reflects on Africa's new green revolution (NGR) movement by drawing data from Ghana as an illustrative case to assess the benefits and challenges of NGR and discuss the long-term environmental implications of NGR interventions. We draw insights from agrarian change theory to understand the complexity of local, national, and international factors that interact to produce changes in agricultural systems that affect smallholder farmers in poor settings. Data were collected using qualitative methods based on the lived experiences of farmers and analyzed to understand farmers' perspectives. We identified increased yield and income levels as crucial benefits of the NGR. Politicization and excessive bureaucracy resulting in perennial delays in the delivery of inputs emerged as critical challenges to the NGR. These findings have implications for the social environment (including the transformation of traditional gender roles and the erosion of traditional knowledge systems) and the physical environment (including forest degradation and the depletion of beneficial soil microbial organisms), which may erode short-term gains of the NGR and compromise broader scale environmental sustainability goals. Critical steps are needed toward consolidating actors and innovations for sustainable agriculture in Africa if global ecological management and poverty reduction objectives are to be achieved consistently with the principles of environmental sustainability.

AB  - This paper describes the national databases and methods that have been used to construct a new expert system-based tool to map High Nature Value (HNV) agricultural land in Estonia. Twenty appropriate indicators from four thematic groups, i.e., land use management, nature conservation, landscape diversity and inherent natural quality, were selected on the basis of use in the literature, the requirement of consistent national datasets and statistical analysis. Each variable was divided into four appropriate classes to produce indicator values according to expert judgement. These classes were added together for each 1 km square to provide a single score to develop an expert system to define HNV. A statistical analysis showed there are few moderate correlations between the individual indicators, suggesting that their selection was sound. The HNV scores for all 1 km squares with agricultural land in Estonia exhibit a normal distribution. The top and bottom 10% of the 1 km squares (3707 and 3501 squares, respectively) were identified in order to investigate the structure of the data further. The former is termed Exceptionally High HNV (EHNV) and the latter Relatively Low HNV (RLNV), while the intermediate class is termed Median HNV (MHNV). The distribution of these groups in Estonia shows readily identifiable patterns linked to known biodiversity "hot spots". A cluster analysis within the EHNV squares produced three classes whose distribution and composition are described to demonstrate the detailed character of Estonian agricultural land with high biodiversity. The methodology is adaptable to other countries that have extensive relevant data bases. The map will be valuable for agricultural policy makers to identify zones with high biodiversity where agri-environment schemes can be targeted. Other stakeholders could also direct development away from EHNV 1 km squares. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Food security is an emerging problem that is faced by our civilization. There are millions of people around the world suffering from various kinds of malnutrition. The number of people that starve will only increase considering the continuous growth of the world's population. The problem of food security can be addressed by timely detection and identification biotic and abiotic stresses in plants that drastically reduce the crop yield. A growing body of evidence suggests that Raman spectroscopy (RS), an emerging analytical technique, can be used for the confirmatory and non-invasive diagnostics of plant stresses. However, it remains unclear whether RS can efficiently disentangle biotic and abiotic stresses, as well as detect both of them simultaneously in plants. In this work, we modeled a stalk rot disease in corn by inoculating the plant stalks with Colletotrichum graminicola. In parallel, we subjected plants to salt stress, as well as challenging plants with both stalk rot disease and salinity stress simultaneously. After the stresses were introduced, Raman spectra were collected from the stalks to reveal stress-specific changes in the plant biochemistry. We found that RS was able to differentiate between stalk rot disease and salinity stresses with 100% accuracy, as well as predict presence of both of those stresses in plants on early and late stages. These results demonstrate that RS is a robust and reliable approach that can be used for confirmatory, non-destructive and label-free diagnostics of biotic and abiotic stresses in plants.

AB  - Dairy production systems represent a significant source of air pollutants such as greenhouse gases (GHG), that increase global warming, and ammonia (NH3), that leads to eutrophication and acidification of natural ecosystems. Greenhouse gases and ammonia are emitted both by conventional and organic dairy systems. Several studies have already been conducted to design practices that reduce greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions from dairy systems. However, those studies did not consider options specifically applied to organic farming, as well as the multiple trade-offs occurring between these air pollutants. This article reviews agricultural practices that mitigate greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions. Those practices can be applied to the most common organic dairy systems in northern Europe such as organic mixed crop-dairy systems. The following major points of mitigation options for animal production, crop production and grasslands are discussed. Animal production: the most promising options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions at the livestock management level involve either the improvement of animal production through dietary changes and genetic improvement or the reduction of the replacement rate. The control of the protein intake of animals is an effective means to reduce gaseous emissions of nitrogen, but it is difficult to implement in organic dairy farming systems. Considering the manure handling chain, mitigation options involve housing, storage and application. For housing, an increase in the amounts of straw used for bedding reduces NH3 emissions, while the limitation of CH4 emissions from deep litter is achieved by avoiding anaerobic conditions. During the storage of solid manure, composting could be an efficient mitigation option, depending on its management. Addition of straw to solid manure was shown to reduce CH4 and N2O emissions from the manure heaps. During the storage of liquid manure, emptying the slurry store before late spring is an efficient mitigation option to limit both CH4 and NH3 emissions. Addition of a wooden cover also reduces these emissions more efficiently than a natural surface crust alone, but may increase N2O emissions. Anaerobic digestion is the most promising way to reduce the overall greenhouse gas emissions from storage and land spreading, without increasing NH3 emissions. At the application stage, NH3 emissions may be reduced by spreading manure during the coolest part of the day, incorporating it quickly and in narrow bands. Crop production: the mitigation options for crop production focus on limiting CO2 and N2O emissions. The introduction of perennial crops or temporary leys of longer duration are promising options to limit CO2 emissions by storing carbon in plants or soils. Reduced tillage or no tillage as well as the incorporation of crop residues also favour carbon sequestration in soils, but these practices may enhance N2O emissions. Besides, the improvement of crop N-use efficiency through effective management of manure and slurry, by growing catch crops or by delaying the ploughing of leys, is of prime importance to reduce N2O emissions. Grassland: concerning grassland and grazing management, permanent conversion from arable to grassland provides high soil carbon sequestration while increasing or decreasing the livestock density seems not to be an appropriate mitigation option. From the study of the multiple interrelations btween gases and between farm compartments, the following mitigation options are advised for organic mixed crop-dairy systems: (1) actions for increasing energy efficiency or fuel savings because they are beneficial in any case, (2) techniques improving efficiency of N management at field and farm levels because they affect not only N2O and NH3 emissions, but also nitrate leaching, and (3) biogas production through anaerobic digestion of manure because it is a promising efficient method to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, even if the profitability of this expensive investment needs to be carefully studied. Finally, the way the farmer implements the mitigation options, i.e. his practices, will be a determining factor in the reduction of greenhouse gas and NH3 emissions.

AB  - Coral reef artisanal fisheries are an important source of nutrition and economic wellbeing for coastal communities, but their management is subject to conflicts and tradeoffs between short-term food security benefits and long-term ecological function. One potential tradeoff is between nutrient capture and fish yields, where targeting small, nutrient-dense species may be more valuable for food security than maximizing fish yields, which is more closely aligned with supporting biodiversity and ecological function. We explored these potential tradeoffs by comparing two similar gears: traditional African basket traps and traps modified with an escape gap. Traps without escape gaps captured a higher frequency of fish with body sizes below their estimated lengths at maximum sustainable yield than gated traps. Estimates of nutrient yields for six micronutrients among the 208 captured species indicated high hump-shaped relationships for gated traps and low and linear positive relationships for traditional traps. Maximum nutrients in gated traps frequently corresponded to body sizes at maximum sustainable yield. Daily capture rates of nutrients were above daily needs more often in gated than traditional traps, but calcium values were low in both trap designs. Gated traps were more likely to capture species with unique and potentially important functional traits, including browsing herbivores, which could have negative effects on ecological functions and reef recovery. However, gated traps also catch fewer immature fish and fewer predators. Our results indicate that nutrient yields can be maximized while using a gear that captures larger and more sustainable body sizes in coral reef artisanal fisheries. Preferential targeting of nutrient-dense fishes is only one of many metrics for evaluating a nutrition-centered management strategy and may only be a management target in specific contexts.

AB  - Soil management practices that increase soil carbon sequestration can improve soil quality and reduce agricultural contribution to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The long-term (45 years) effect of applications of manure (FYM) and inorganic (NPK) fertilizers on soil aggregate characteristics and soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration was studied in surface soil of a Typic Haplustalf sandy loam. Soils from four treatments: inorganic fertilizer in combination with farmyard manure (FYM + NPK), fertilizer only (NPK), farmyard manure only (FYM) and a control receiving neither NPK nor FYM were studied. Results indicate that long-term application of manure with or without NPK improved aggregate stability by increasing mean weight diameter (MWD) of dry aggregate and fraction of dry aggregate > 2.0 mm. Higher values of MWD were also recorded in the water-stable aggregate size distributions for soils amended with either FYM or NPK. Soils amended with FYM + NPK sequestered more SOC than all other treatments. There was a low, but significant positive correlation between MWD of dry aggregates and SOC. Highest values of SOC were recorded in the > 2.0 mm aggregate fractions. This tendency towards greater SOC concentration for > 2.0 mm dry aggregate is suggestive of the effectiveness of this aggregate size range to sequester SOC in savanna Alfisols. These results demonstrate that continuous application of soil amendments like FYM and NPK over a long-term promotes soil aggregate stability and long-term SOC sequestration. Hence, for sustainable production in savanna Alfisols, there is a need to design policies that will promote soil aggregate stability and long-term carbon sequestration under continuous cultivation. Such policies must give attention to soil management practices that maintain higher level of SOC. Here, FYM with or without NPK was essential to increase stability of dry aggregates and SOC sequestration. However, the NPK amended soils possess higher fraction of water-stable aggregates.

AB  - This paper examines tree crop farming and alley farming practices in Africa and the impact of such practices on carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation. Using a meta-analysis approach, estimates of soil carbon and organic matter accumulated due to tree crop farming and alley farming were standardized due to different units of reporting for soil carbon. A review of the scientific literature on soil carbon sequestration in Africa was carried out to assess the greenhouse gas mitigation potential of different water management activities using on-line scholarly and scientific databases as well as more general search engines such as Google. The review covered 90 study estimates across African countries. The results show that the mean carbon sequestrations through tree crop farming and alley farming are 1,359 and 1,458 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. It is therefore important that these practices be scaled-out to more farmers due to the benign effect on the environment.

AB  - Purpose The provision of safe food is a topic of increasing relevance worldwide. Several countries, including Azerbaijan, attempted to develop scientific, applied, social and economic solutions to the food supply and nutrition problems. However, Azerbaijan still faces important challenges, particularly providing appropriate, eco-friendly and microbiologically safe supplies and food. These issues occur in international export and import of raw food materials and food, provision of regional and municipal control in food supply and sales and teaching food culture to the public. This viewpoint paper aims to examine the challenges that impede the provision of safe food for Azerbaijan. Such information can facilitate policy implications for governments in developing solutions to the food supply. Design/methodology/approach Extensive literature review is done to base the discussions of this viewpoint paper. Findings Academic institutions and departments should take a more centralized and effective effort in scientific research concerning safety, hygiene and culture of nutrition. In conclusion, to ensure proper sustainment, it is necessary to provide strict microbiological, sanitary and hygienic control across the network of production and distribution of food and its import and export within regional and local food source provision systems and mechanisms. Originality/value To the authors' best knowledge, there is no systematic study evaluating the challenges of ecologically and microbiological safety for food in Azerbaijan.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) is an essential nutrient for food production. The rapid increase in population requires high inputs of N to meet the growing food demand. If not managed well, the substantial loss of N from the food system has multiple impacts on grain yield, air and water pollution, and the economic benefits of agricultural. Multi -objective (food security, environmental sustainability and economic sustainability) synergistic consideration of N management in the food system is still lacking. This study employed strategies for optimizing N management in the food system, using Quzhou County as a typical example on the North China Plain. Firstly, a food chain approach was adopted to understand drivers and reasons behind N losses from the food system. Secondly, a top -down approach was used to define multi -objective N management, taking into consideration food security, environmental sustainability and economic sustainability. Multi -objective N management aims to reduce N losses to the environment and increase N use efficiencies, while simultaneously increasing yields and economic benefits. Thirdly, 3R (reduce -retain -recycle) N management strategies were identified for specific crops and animals through a bottom -up approach and then analyzed the potential of these strategies to achieve the multi -objectives. Finally, there is a discussion of how to engage different stakeholders to promote the technologies implementation. This study provides new insights into the synergistic achievement of multi -objective N management in the food system and the development of environmentally -friendly agriculture.

AB  - Accurate delineation of paddy fields holds importance in ensuring food security, efficient water resource management, and precise evaluation of greenhouse gas emissions. Here we propose an innovative approach, the asynchronous flooding and object-based (AF-OB) model, aimed at optimizing phenology-based paddy field mapping. The AF-OB model capitalizes on the asynchronous flooding phenomenon observed between paddy fields and nonpaddy fields, along with the seasonal variations in the normalized difference vegetation index. The simple noniterative clustering algorithm is integrated to mitigate the common issue of the "pretzel effect" encountered in paddy field mapping. Evaluation through independent samples yields compelling results, with the paddy field map generated by the AF-OB method achieving an overall accuracy of 94.28%. The paddy fields extracted using the AF-OB method exhibit alignment with statistical data, surpassing comparable algorithms relying on alternative land use products in terms of visual quality. Furthermore, the AF-OB model exhibits stability across time, space, and sensors, thus enhancing its applicability and robustness. The outputs of the AF-OB method offer reference data for informed agricultural production planning and the effective management of water resources.

AB  - Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a major global commodity and the primary source for baked products in agri-food supply chains. Consumers are increasingly demanding more nutritious food products with less environmental degradation, particularly related to water and fertilizer nitrogen (N) inputs. While triticale (x Triticosecale) is often referenced as having superior abiotic stress tolerance compared to wheat, few studies have compared crop productivity and resource use efficiencies under a range of N-and water-limited conditions. Because previous work has shown that blending wheat with triticale in a 40:60 ratio can yield acceptable and more nutritious baked products, we tested the hypothesis that increasing the use of triticale grain in the baking supply chain would reduce the environmental footprint for water and N fertilizer use. Using a dataset comprised of 37 site-years encompassing normal and stress-induced environments in California, we assessed yield, yield stability, and the efficiency of water and fertilizer N use for 67 and 17 commercial varieties of wheat and triticale, respectively. By identifying environments that favor one crop type over the other, we then quantified the sustainability implications of producing a mixed triticale-wheat flour at the regional scale. Results indicate that triticale outyielded wheat by 11% (p < 0.05) and 19% (p < 0.05) under average and N-limited conditions, respectively. However, wheat was 3% (p < 0.05) more productive in water-limited environments. Overall, triticale had greater yield stability and produced more grain per unit of water and N fertilizer inputs, especially in high-yielding environments. We estimate these differences could translate to regional N fertilizer savings (up to 555 Mg N or 166 CO2-eq kg ha(-1)) in a 40:60 blending scenario when wheat is sourced from water-limited and low-yielding fields and triticale from N-limited and high-yielding areas. Results suggest that optimizing the agronomic and environmental benefits of triticale would increase the overall resource use efficiency and sustainability of the agri-food system, although such a transition would require fundamental changes to the current system spanning producers, processors, and consumers.

AB  - This study tries to provide a comprehensive analysis of the long-run relationships between environmental degradation and major economic and demographic variables such as GDP, GCF, agricultural land, and population growth. Initially, we conducted Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Phillips-Perron unit root tests to assess the stationarity of the variables. Since some of the variables are integrated in mixed, it became important to guarantee that the ARDL model provided robust long-run estimations by cautiously controlling the stationarity issue. The findings indicate that both GDP growth and population increase are linked to greater environmental degradation. On the other hand, investments in infrastructure and the expansion of agricultural land appear to help reduce some of these adverse effects. In particular, while economic growth and population pressures significantly contribute to environmental challenges, strategic investments in infrastructure and sustainable agriculture show promise in mitigating these impacts.

AB  - Dutch methane emissions from manure treatment and storage are estimated to be 115 Gg CH4, which is about 1.5% of total greenhouse gas emissions. A possible option to reduce methane emissions from manure storages is to feed emissions into the soil next to the storage, where it is oxidized by methanotrophic bacteria, comparable to the way methane is oxidized in top-layers of landfills. A feasibility study is performed to evaluate the technical and economic viability of the method. An annual average methane oxidizing capacity of about 23 g m2 h1 seems to be feasible in sandy or loamy soils, without major modifications. A single manure storage will require a few 100m2 of soil to abate 70% or more of its methane. The system seems to be economically feasible and cost-effective. Additional investments are less than 5% of the total costs of a manure storage. Costs for emission reduction are Euro 1 to 4 per Mg CO2-eq. Proof of concept was no part of this feasibility study. The technology described is only expected and not demonstrated to work.

AB  - This review highlights the potential of vermicompost and its derived products as sustainable and eco-friendly solutions for enhancing production and pest management in grain crops. It assesses their impact comprehensively on crops such as maize, wheat, barley, rice, and pearl millet. Vermicompost improves soil quality, increases nutrient availability, boosts crop productivity, and enhances pest and disease tolerance. It acts as an organic fertilizer, enriching the soil with essential nutrients, humic acids, growth-regulating hormones, and enzymes, improving plant nutrition, photosynthesis, and overall crop quality. Furthermore, vermicompost shows promise in mitigating soil degradation and sequestering organic carbon while demonstrating the potential for pest management, including effectiveness against pests like fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda). This review emphasizes the importance of integrated nutrient management and proper application strategies to maximize the benefits of vermicompost in grain crops. Factors such as the form and timing of application, efficacy against specific pests, and economic viability for different farming scales are discussed. Understanding these factors is crucial for successfully implementing and adopting vermicompost-based pest management strategies in grain crops. This review also explores the potential of vermicomposting as an eco-friendly and cost-effective solution to remediate organic contaminants, emerging contaminants, personal-care and pharmaceutical products, and microplastics. The review further identifies knowledge gaps and highlights the need for future studies to effectively utilize vermicompost and its derived products in cereal production for sustainable agriculture, contributing to global food security.

AB  - Economists have in recent times recognized that a household's sense of well-being depends not just on its average income or expenditure but on the risk it faces as well. Vulnerability is thus a very crucial issue in welfare analysis. This study estimated and analysed the magnitude of vulnerability to food poverty based on data from the 2004 Nigeria Living Standard Survey (NLSS) obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics. The three-step Feasible Generalized Least Squares (3FGLS) procedure was employed in estimating the extent of vulnerability to food poverty in Nigeria. The results show that 61.68 per cent of Nigerians were vulnerable to food poverty; the incidence of vulnerability to food poverty varied significantly across zones and between the urban and rural sectors; and was highest in the South West zone (68.32 per cent) and lowest in North East zone (50.19 per cent); and it is more in the urban sector (64.61 per cent) than in the rural (59.37 per cent). It is evident that the magnitude of vulnerability to food poverty is very high. Thus, policies that will enhance people's access to food should be adopted and targeted transfers of subsidized basic food items should be used to sufficiently reduce vulnerability to food poverty in the country.

AB  - Tef and wheat are staple grains in Ethiopia and are an important part of Ethiopian food security. The DSSAT NWheat and DSSAT Tef models were used to examine the effects of nitrogen fertilizer, planting date, and atmospheric CO2 on tef and wheat grain yields across four locations in Ethiopia and a 30-year time period. Observed wheat yields were consistently higher than observed tef yields, but the models showed that tef could outproduce wheat in some low yielding scenarios. Wheat yields were more responsive to N fertilizer than tef, due to a higher harvest index causing more of the additional biomass to be allocated to grain yields. Frequently, high rainfall increased N leaching, exacerbated N stress, and reduced yields for both crops. Early planting was often detrimental to yields, except for regions and years with terminal drought and heat stress. With continuously increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, wheat, as a C3 crop, will further outperform tef, a C4 crop, in the future, as long as N is not limiting. Breeding for lodging resistance and a higher harvest index could significantly improve future tef yields, while higher N applications and the use of split fertilizer applications to avoid leaching would improve both tef and wheat yields. As wheat has a higher N response than tef, is more responsive to future elevated atmospheric CO2 levels, and is generally higher yielding, wheat could add more to food security in Ethiopia. However, under low input, low yielding conditions, growing tef will likely remain the preferred cereal in Ethiopia due to its higher cultural, nutritional and economic value.

AB  - The COVID 19 pandemic is one of the greatest threats of the 21st century that disturbed whole human's life and all sectors of the global economy. Due to highly infectious and spreading capacity of SARS-CoV-2 the governments took unprecedented measures worldwide with a great impact on the most vulnerable groups (people affected by chronically hunger, malnourished children and small farmers) and sectors. Agriculture is the most important economic sector that cares the responsibility for food security and human development. The present paper identifies and synthetize relevant literature to provide an integrated overview of the current state-of-knowledge on the economic impact of COVID 19 pandemic on agriculture and food security, including also forward-looking statements on future measures to mitigate the effects on crop production, food demand, agricultural products supply, inputs supply, agricultural products market, farmers' income and rural poverty. The study emphasizes that due to the mobility restrictions, decline in international trade, reduced purchasing power, disturbance in food production and food processing, food insecurity may arise affecting especially the small farmers from the regions already affected by poverty, climate change and conflicts. Therefore, the governments and international organizations should enforce the measures to control the pandemic, with minimum economic losses, without disturbing the food supply chain and re-enforcing the food security of their citizens.

AB  - Access to, and control over, water for irrigation is one of the most important factors for increasing agricultural productivity, thereby affecting household food security and levels of poverty in developing countries. However, investments in the irrigation sector have often failed to consider equity aspects of irrigation interventions. Using data from 199 households from three irrigation systems in the mid-hills of Nepal, we analyse access and control of water in different levels of socio-economic heterogeneities. The results demonstrate that efforts to improve livelihoods of the rural poor should give due consideration to the distributional aspects of irrigation interventions, with authority for allocating the level of access to irrigation water given to the farmers throughout the system.

AB  - We assessed land cover and land use change in Driefontein Grasslands Important Bird Area (Driefontein IBA), Zimbabwe, after the land reforms that took place in 2000, using remotely sensed satellite land cover images of 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010. A drive transect was done for ground truthing. Data were analysed spatially in a Geographical Information System environment. Changes in land cover and land use proportions were recorded from 1995 to 2010 throughout the Driefontein IBA. The land cover classes of grassland and wetland showed a decrease, whereas land area under cultivation increased during 1995-2010. However, the woodland area marginally remained constant over the same time. We concluded that changes in land cover in the study area were largely driven by land use change, i.e., increase in cultivation, following the resettlement of people within the Driefontein IBA. It is likely that with increasing human population the natural habitat of the study area will be degraded further, negatively impacting key sensitive habitats such as wetlands, bird species, and other biodiversity. Threats to birds and wetlands habitats are also threats to human livelihoods because people in this semi-arid area depend on wetland ecosystem services for their survival. The study recommends continuous monitoring of Driefontein IBA for conservation of birds and their habitats.

AB  - Many studies have predicted, at a national scale, the economic viability of new forestry plantings to contribute to mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions in Australia's cleared agricultural lands. Such predictions are highly uncertain given: (i) differences in site quality, management regimes and planting geometries (belt versus block configurations) result in rates of sequestration that are highly variable at regional scales and (ii) uncertainties in carbon accounting methods in future carbon markets. Here we examined the economics of three case studies (two of farm forestry and one of biodiverse environmental plantings) to address these issues. There was significant variation in economic viability both between and within case studies (average coefficient of variation of 39%) as a result of differences in site quality, management regime and planting geometries. We conclude that if carbon offset investment targets marginal land (i.e. areas of farms of lowest productivity), carbon prices required for economic viability are <$18t CO2-e, even at a relatively high discount rate of 8%. Although regional employment generated per hectare tends to be less than many existing agricultural enterprises, any jobs generated from use of this low productivity land for carbon forestry would be additional. Economic viability was generally greatest for 3-4 row belt farm forestry plantings because of increased growth, particularly in areas of relatively high rainfall. Supplementary payments may therefore be needed to make biodiverse environmental plantings competitive in areas of lower rainfall and thus less profitability. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Peasant farming systems are multifunctional, since their culture-based structure generates different environmental, social and economic functions. However, agricultural modernization and the change from agricultural to urban zones have caused the loss of multifunctionality in these systems. Therefore, the objective of this study was to generate a peasant family farming multifunctionality index for the municipality of Calpan, Puebla. A survey was conducted to gather information and the instrument was a questionnaire applied to a sample of 81 producers. A peasant family farming multifunctionality index (PFFMI) was generated, made up of four fields: sociocultural, environmental, economic, and territorial; four general functions, 12 specific ones, and 17 indicators. The results show a PFFMI of 72.61, corresponding to category IV, medium high, with outstanding functions such as: conservation of knowledge, maintenance of agricultural biodiversity, conservation of agroecological practices, consolidation of food security, promotion of job generation, support of landscapes configurations, and rootedness of the territory. The study concludes that peasant family farming maintains a high functionality.

AB  - This study examines the economic potential of using either no-tillage or conventional tillage with either commercial nitrogen or cattle manure to sequester soil in continuous corn production. This research uses stochastic efficiency with respect to a function to determine the preferred production systems under various risk preferences and utility-weighted certainty equivalent risk premiums to determine the carbon credit values needed to motivate adoption of systems, which sequester higher levels of carbon. The results indicate that no-tillage and cattle manure increase carbon sequestration. Carbon credits or government program incentives are not required to entice risk-averse managers to use no-tillage, but are required to encourage manure use as a means of sequestering additional carbon even at historically high nitrogen prices. New environmental rules for confined animal feeding operations may increase the demand for land to apply manure as a primary nutrient source and participation in the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, Conservation Security Program, and a carbon credit market to obtain payments to offset some or all of the costs of manure application.

AB  - One way to slow down climate change is to help consumers to make more sustainable decisions. The food system accounts for up to one third of greenhouse gas emissions. To ensure consumers can make more sustainable food choices they need to have the necessary knowledge to do so. But consumer perception of the sustainability of food product characteristics might differ from results of greenhouse gas emissions or other environmental impacts in a life-cycle assessments of food products. The aspects of sustainability that are estimated incorrect by consumers need to be identified, so that the necessary knowledge to make more sustainable choices can be provided. To gain insights into consumer perception of the sustainability of food product characteristics, using the example of processed tomatoes, we conducted a qualitative study in Germany using focus group discussion. Ten young consumers, aged between 18 and 37, participated. Millennials and consumers from Generation Z were selected as they are considered to be crucial to a change towards more sustainable food production in the future. The focus group discussion was analyzed using the qualitative summarizing content analysis according to Mayring. The main findings indicate that consumers overestimate the sustainability of glass packaging and regional production. In contrast, consumers underestimate the emissions from heated greenhouses and the sustainability of composite boards and plastic packaging. The study shows that consumers are misinformed regarding sustainability of food product characteristics, such as production systems, packaging, and origin and that there is a need to better inform consumers, so that they have the knowledge to make more sustainable food choices.

AB  - The current industrial pig production model is in crisis, due to its association with environmental pollution, doubtful product quality and lack of animal well-being. In Bretagne (France), a region of intensive pig production, a survey of seven stakeholder groups concerned with pig production was conducted, as part of a research programme dedicated to the assessment of the environmental impact of different modes of pig production. A very large majority of pig. producers (93%) and their suppliers (100%) considers pig farms as an asset for the region, whereas a majority of scientists (58%), activists (78%) and consumers (54%) sees it as a handicap. Differences among stakeholder groups are minor with respect to the perceived importance of environmental and social issues. Stakeholders agree on the relative level of responsibility of pig farms with respect to specific problems. For all groups unpleasant odours and water quality come first with respect to responsibility, for most groups soil quality comes second, followed by product safety and air quality. For a future improved mode of pig production, 76% of pig producers and their suppliers prefer to adapt the current model, for all other groups the majority prefers an alternative model. While pig producers and their suppliers prefer a slurry-based housing system, all other groups prefer a straw-based system. Pig producers see the slurry-based system as technically superior and associate the straw-based system with poor working conditions, whereas consumers associate the slurry-based system in the first place with poor water quality and associate the straw-based system with less pollution. These results will be of use in the research programme on the environmental impact of modes of pig production, as they indicate the environmental impacts to be considered and their relative importance. The results will also help in deciding which options should be assessed. It is concluded that the poor image of the current pig production model and its production practices with consumers does not seem compatible with a sustainable demand for pork products.

AB  - Perennial vegetables are a neglected and underutilized class of crops with potential to address 21(st) century challenges. They represent 33-56% of cultivated vegetable species, and occupy 6% of world vegetable cropland. Despite their distinct relevance to climate change mitigation and nutritional security, perennial vegetables receive little attention in the scientific literature. Compared to widely grown and marketed vegetable crops, many perennial vegetables show higher levels of key nutrients needed to address deficiencies. Trees with edible leaves are the group of vegetables with the highest levels of these key nutrients. Individual "multi-nutrient" species are identified with very high levels of multiple nutrients for addressing deficiencies. This paper reports on the synthesis and meta-analysis of a heretofore fragmented global literature on 613 cultivated perennial vegetables, representing 107 botanical families from every inhabited continent, in order to characterize the extent and potential of this class of crops. Carbon sequestration potential from new adoption of perennial vegetables is estimated at 22.7-280.6 MMT CO2-eq/yr on 4.6-26.4 Mha by 2050.

AB  - The objective of this study is to identify Mexican nontoxic ecotypes of Jatropha curcas with potential for a sustainable agriculture practice to produce biodiesel and food products through a methodology and criteria of sustainability. In a rural region of Morelos state in central Mexico, nine Mexican ecotypes of Jatropha curcas were evaluated in an experimental plantation with minimal water resources and fertilization. The experimental trial was assessed in terms of (1) toxicity, (2) growth and survival of the plants, (3) yield of seed, (4) residual biomass production, (5) oil characteristics for biodiesel production, (6) nutrimental properties of the seeds, and (7) changes in the chemical properties of the soil. Finally, two outstanding nontoxic ecotypes were identified as the most suitable for the establishment of Jatropha curcas crops to produce biodiesel and, at the same time, for food products using the de-oiled endosperm cake, for energy production from the residual biomass and for improvement of soil properties in marginal lands of rural regions of Morelos state.

AB  - Intensive crop production on grassland-derived Mollisols has liberated massive amounts of carbon (C) to the atmosphere. Whether minimizing soil disturbance, diversifying crop rotations, or re-establishing perennial grasslands and integrating livestock can slow or reverse this trend remains highly uncertain. We investigated how these management practices affected soil organic carbon (SOC) accrual and distribution between particulate (POM) and mineral-associated (MAOM) organic matter in a 29-y-old field experiment in the North Central United States and assessed how soil microbial traits were related to these changes. Compared to conventional continuous maize monocropping with annual tillage, systems with reduced tillage, diversified crop rotations with cover crops and legumes, or manure addition did not increase total SOC storage or MAOM-C, whereas perennial pastures managed with rotational grazing accumulated more SOC and MAOM-C (18 to 29% higher) than all annual cropping systems after 29 y of management. These results align with a meta-analysis of data from published studies comparing the efficacy of soil health management practices in annual cropping systems on Mollisols worldwide. Incorporating legumes and manure into annual cropping systems enhanced POM-C, microbial biomass, and microbial C-use efficiency but did not significantly increase microbial necromass accumulation, MAOM-C, or total SOC storage. Diverse, rotationally grazed pasture management has the potential to increase persistent soil C on Mollisols, highlighting the key role of well-managed grasslands in climate-smart agriculture.

AB  - Synthetic pesticides are widely applied in modern agriculture, where they are used against diseases, pests, and weeds to secure crop yield and quality. However, their intensive application has led to widespread contamination of the environment, including soils. Due to their inherent toxicity, they might pose a risk to soil health by causing harm to non-target organisms and disrupting ecosystem services in both agricultural and other exposed soils. Following the Swiss National Action Plan on the reduction of pesticide risks, Agroscope has conducted several soil monitoring studies that are briefly presented here. All of them resort to different multi-residue trace analytical approaches to simultaneously quantify up to about 150 modern pesticides by either accelerated solvent, or Quick, Easy, Cheap, Efficient, Rugged, Safe (QuEChERS) extraction, followed by separation and detection with liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. While partly still in progress, our investigations led to the following major findings thus far: Multiple pesticides are commonly present in soils, with individual concentrations in agricultural soils often reaching up to a few tens of mu g/kg. Pesticide occurrence and concentrations in agricultural soils primarily depend on land use, land use history and cultivated crops. Pesticides can prevail much longer than predicted by their half-lives and were found in soils even decades after conversion from conventional to organic farming. Corresponding residual fractions can be in the order of a few percent of the originally applied amounts. We further found negative associations of pesticide residues with the abundance of beneficial soil life, underpinning their potential risk to the fertility of agricultural soils. Traces of pesticides are also detected in soils to which they were never applied, indicating contamination, e.g. via spray drift or atmospheric deposition. These results confirm the general notion of both scientists and legislators that prospective risk assessments (RA; as executed during registration and use authorization) should be confirmed and adjusted by retrospective RA (e.g. by environmental monitoring studies of currently used compounds) to jointly lead to an overall reduced environmental risk of pesticides.

AB  - In semi-arid Northern Ghana, smallholder farmers face food insecurity and financial risk due to climate change. In response, the Village Savings and Loan Association (VSLA) model, a community-led microfinance model, has emerged as a promising finance and climate resilience strategy. VSLAs offer savings, loans, and other financial services to help smallholder farmers cope with climate risks. In northern Ghana, where formal financial banking is limited, VSLAs serve as vital financial resources for smallholder farmers. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen how VSLAs can bridge financial inclusion and climate resilience strategies to address food insecurity. From a sustainable livelihoods framework (SLF) perspective, we utilized data from a cross-sectional survey of 517 smallholder farmers in northern Ghana's Upper West Region to investigate how VSLAs relate to food insecurity. Results from an ordered logistic regression show that households with membership in a VSLA were less likely to experience severe food insecurity (OR = 0.437, p < 0.01). In addition, households that reported good resilience, owned land, had higher wealth, were female-headed, and made financial decisions jointly were less likely to experience severe food insecurity. Also, spending time accessing the market increases the risk of severe food insecurity. Despite the challenges of the VSLA model, these findings highlight VSLAs' potential to mitigate food insecurity and serve as a financially resilient and climate-resilient strategy in resource-poor contexts like the UWR and similar areas in Sub-Saharan Africa. VSLAs could contribute to achieving SDG2, zero hunger, and SDG13, climate action. However, policy interventions are necessary to support and scale VSLAs as a sustainable development and food security strategy in vulnerable regions.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the impact of long-term grassland management on the temporal dynamic of SOC density in two temperate grasslands. The top soil SOC density, soil total nitrogen density and soil bulk density (0-20 cm) under long-term fencing and grazing treatments, the aboveground net primary productivity of fenced plots and the associated climatic factors of Leymus chinensis and Stipa grandis grasslands in Inner Mongolia were collected from literatures and analyzed. The results showed that the SOC density increased linearly with fenced duration but was insensitive to grazed duration in both grasslands. Compared with long-term grazing, fenced plots had larger potential for carbon sequestration, and the accumulation rate of SOC density was 29 and 35 g Cm(-2)y(-1) for L. chinensis and S. grandis grasslands. Fenced duration and mean annual temperature jointly contributed large effect on temporal pattern of SOC density. Climate change and grazed duration had little influence on the inter-annual variance of SOC density in grazed plots. Our results confirmed the enhancement effect of long-term fencing on soil carbon sequestration in degraded temperate grassland, and long-term permanent plot observation is essential and effective for accurately and comprehensively understanding the temporal dynamic of SOC storage.

AB  - Sustainable agriculture has emerged as a critical topic in the context of sustainable development goals set by the United Nations. A key aspect impacting the sustainability of the agriculture supply chain is the usage of agrochemicals. Transitioning to sustainable alternatives from agrochemicals poses challenges, as it affects farms' productivity, income, and food supply to the market. The delicate balance between farm income and greenhouse gas emissions related to chemical fertilizer usage has not been addressed adequately using a dynamic system behavior perspective. This study employs a System Dynamics model to simulate the impact of adopting biofertilizers on the triple-bottom-line performance of the agrochemical supply chain from a policy perspective. The model aims to understand stakeholder behavior within the fertilizer supply chain and enhance its sustainability. Additionally, the study models the effects of various input subsidies using the design of experiments in an Indian agrochemical supply chain, examining trade-offs involved in the triple-bottom-line (social, environmental, and economic) parameters for each subsidy. The simulation model offers policymakers insights into determining appropriate subsidy levels to facilitate a sustainable transition of agricultural supply chains. In this context, various possible scenarios were obtained by simulating the policy parameters (agriproduct price, chemical fertilizer prices, biofertilizer fixed costs, and biofertilizer subsidies) resulting in optimal levels of environmental impact, producer profit, and social benefit. It also provides a comprehensive evaluation of the triple-bottom-line effects of policy strategies, thereby facilitating the comprehension of trade-offs in the supply chains of lower/middle-income countries. The study contributes valuable guidance for policymakers to make informed decisions for promoting sustainable agriculture and achieving the triple-bottom-line objectives in the agrochemical industry.

AB  - As climate change increases the probability and/or severity of major disturbances worldwide, understanding how agroecological food systems can be resilient to the effects of major disturbances becomes critical. Farm-level crop and cultivar richness are critical to food security and nutritional dietary diversity, but quantitative research of how they are impacted by major disturbances, including the dynamics of their recovery, is largely lacking. We assessed the resilience of an agroforest-based food system to a recent Category 5 cyclone. Specifically, we carried out vegetation surveys in Fijian agroforests pre-cyclone, and 1 and 3 years post-cyclone, to assess changes in staple starch crop and cultivar richness over time. Resilience, measured as robustness, redundancy, reactivity, and resourcefulness, varied with the scale of analysis. At both the crop and cultivar scale, the agroforestry systems were highly reactive to cyclone disturbance. Crop species richness increased immediately post-cyclone and 3 years later remained higher than pre-cyclone levels, largely due to the increased presence of famine food crops, indicating system robustness, redundancy, and resourcefulness as well. Farmers also planted many new starch crop cultivars post-cyclone, especially of sweet potatoes, but the total number of cultivars declined over time, indicating limited redundancy and resourcefulness. Frequent crop substitutions for cassava over taro or yams, and high cultivar dynamism that resulted in the loss of traditional varieties, can have consequences both for nutritional diversity and the maintenance of cultural traditions. This research suggests resilience is present in Fijian agroforest systems, yet a greater focus on crop cultivar diversity is needed.

AB  - Agricultural residues are produced in large quantities and their management is an issue all over the world. Many of these residues consist of plant materials in different degrees of transformation, so returning them back to soil is a management option that closes loops in a circular economy context. The objective of this paper is to summarize current knowledge on the options and effects of reusing agricultural residues as organic soil amendments. The reuse of these residues in soil is a good solution for minimizing the problems associated with their management, while improving soil health and ecosystem functions. While some agricultural residues can be applied directly to soil, others will need previous transformations such as composting to improve their properties. This allows the recovery of plant nutrients and increase in soil organic matter contents, with many positive effects on the soil's physical, chemical and biological properties, and ultimately, crop production, although potential risks derived from some materials must also be considered. The concept of regenerative agriculture and soil management using organic soil amendments contribute to the significant enhancement of soil biodiversity, the protection of the environment and climate goal achievement.

AB  - An experiment was conducted for five-years (2005-06 to 2009-10) to evaluate the impact of Sesbania green-manuring (GM), mustard-residue recycling and fertilizers on soil health and productivity of Indian mustard under fallow-mustard sequence. Sesbania (GM) significantly increased SOC, carbon-sequestration-potential rate, infiltration rate, available NPK status but decreased bulk density. Supplementing mustard-residue recycling 2.5 t ha(-1) further improved the soil quality attributes significantly. The increase in fertilizer from N40P8.7K0 to N80P17.4K33.3 also improved the soil attributes gradually. This improvement in soil properties due to Sesbania (GM) and mustard-residue recycling significantly influenced plant height, branches/plant, siliquae/plant, seeds/siliqua and ultimately seed and oil yield compared to existing fallow-mustard practice. The mustard seed yield was increased by 42.3% due to Sesbania (GM) and by 63.9% due to supplementary mustard residue recycling in five years. Increase in fertilizers levels from N-40 to N-80 and P-8.7 to P-17.4 significantly improved mustard yield attributes, seed and oil yield while results of K application was inconsistent. The combined application of N80P17.4K33.3 synergistically increased the seed yield by 82.1% over N40P8.7K0. Sustainability yield index, partial factor productivity, production efficiency and incremental benefit cost ratio also showed significant improvement due to Sesbania (GM), mustard-residue recycling and judicious fertilizer use.

AB  - Hydro-climatic resilience is an essential element of food security. The miombo ecosystem in Southern Africa supports varied land uses for a growing population. Albedo, Leaf Area Index (LAI), Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC), Solar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF), and precipitation remote-sensing data for current climate were jointly analyzed to explore vegetation dynamics and water availability feedbacks. Changes in the surface energy balance tied to vegetation status were examined in the light of an hourly albedo product with improved atmospheric correction derived for this study. Phase-space analysis shows that the albedo's seasonality tracks the landscape-scale functional stability of miombo and woody savanna with respect to precipitation variations. Miombo exhibits the best adaptive traits to water stress which highlights synergies among root-system water uptake capacity, vegetation architecture, and landscape hydro-geomorphology. This explains why efforts to conserve the spatial structure of the miombo forest in sustainable farming of seasonal wetlands have led to significant crop yield increases. Grass savanna's high vulnerability to water stress is illustrative of potential run-away impacts of miombo deforestation. This study suggests that phase-space analysis of albedo, SIF, and FVC can be used as operational diagnostics of ecosystem health.

AB  - Research is essential for improvement of agricultural productivity, resource use and resilience, and for food systems transformation more broadly. This article analyzes the drivers of past agricultural productivity growth in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) and argues that productivity is not growing fast enough to meet the needs of a global population of 10 billion by 2050. A sustainable transformation of agri-food systems in LMICs will need greater and faster technical change. Higher investment in agri-food R&D is therefore needed to accelerate productivity growth and address the social, economic, nutritional and environmental challenges facing LMICs. Greater and better -targeted investment in sustainable technologies and climate change mitigation and adaptation will be particularly important to reducing the climate change impacts on agriculture and food security in the coming decades. However, LMICs with small research systems and limited innovation capacity lack the scale and resources to effectively tackle the challenges ahead. Better coordination and a clear articulation of roles and responsibilities among national, subregional, regional and global R&D actors (both from the public and private sectors) are essential to ensuring that scarce financial, human, and infrastructure resources are optimized, duplications minimized, and synergies and complementarities enhanced.(c) The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - In rapidly developing countries, intensive agriculture faces the conflict between food security and environmental deterioration. To improve the sustainability of agricultural land use, this paper proposes an integrated framework for risk assessment and conflict coordination to cope with these salient challenges at the administrative unit level. This framework is demonstrated using a case study conducted in the Dongting Lake area in China. Drawing upon diverse sources of statistical data concerning agricultural inputs and outputs, water resources and natural hazards as well as questionnaire surveys conducted at the household level, this paper uses the Cobb Douglas production function and the water environmental pressure index to assess food insecurity risk and environmental risk from food production, respectively. A double matrix method is used to characterize the degree of sustainability based on the risk assessment. The results indicate that the overall food security of the region can be maintained in the negligible-risk range. However, rising agro-environmental risks from grain production in the coming years are likely to threaten the sustainability of agricultural land use in most administrative units. It is suggested that optimization of land use patterns and mitigation of natural hazards could be effective approaches to improve the sustainability of local agricultural land use.

AB  - In recent years, the Chinese government has been continuously promoting reduced use of chemical fertilizers and enhancing the sustainable development capacity of agriculture. This study uses China's Household Finance Survey (CHFS) data to explore the impact of rural labor transfer on the intensity of fertilizer use and examines the mediating role of agricultural machinery services. The results show that: (1) rural labor transfer is helpful for reducing chemical fertilizer use, and it has a negative impact on the intensity of chemical fertilizer use; (2) rural labor transfer will enhance the socialization of agricultural machinery services by promoting the adoption of mechanized fertilization and expanding the scale of agricultural land management to promote the reduction of chemical fertilizers use; (3) different topographic conditions have different regulatory effects on the use of socialized agricultural machinery services, and for mountainous areas with poor topographic conditions, socialized agricultural machinery services may be difficult to implement, resulting in poor effects of chemical fertilizer use reduction. These findings provide important evidence for sustainable agriculture development and have significant theoretical and policy implications.

Information asymmetry is the major root cause of food fraud and especially problematic in products with value adding credence attributes, such as organic foods. Therefore, vulnerability mitigation is an important task for participants of the supply chain. As statistics show a rise in food fraud cases, certification schemes such as organic farming, fairtrade, or animal welfare are adapting their standards accordingly and can cause barriers to participation in such schemes. Distributed ledger technologies (DLT), such as Blockchains, hold the potential to supervise and manage supply chains and hold promising potential for reducing risk of food fraud from different angles. However, targeted orchestration of the different functionalities is to date missing in the organic food supply chain. This gap is addressed by this study, focusing on the extent to which DLTs can help prevent food fraud in organic-certified supply chains. The findings show that the technological capacity is further advanced than the readiness of industry stakeholders regarding technology adoption. Yet stakeholders approve of the potential benefits of introducing DLTs in their supply chains, which are scarcely used today. Policy schemes hold the potential to overcome current obstacles such as legal prerequisites and financials by fostering technology dissemination through different measures.

AB  - Effective management of crop straw is crucial for sustainable food production, renewable energy transition and climate change mitigation. However, accurately estimating reasonable removal rates to enhance grain yield and transition to bioenergy remains challenging. Through nationwide systematic surveys and meta-analysis, reasonable straw removal rates of 45 % for rice, 19 % for wheat, and 42 % for maize were identified in China. The potential bioenergy production derived from these reasonably removed straws ranges from 23 to 100 Mtce in 2022. The combined adjustment of straw utilization and fossil fuel offset through bioenergy leads to a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 218 to 309 Mt in 2022. Particularly, maize straw emerges as a preferred feedstock for bioenergy and climate mitigation due to its highest bioenergy production and GHG emissions reduction potential. These findings provide critical insights into optimizing agricultural residue management in China, guiding efforts toward food security and carbon neutrality goals.

AB  - The importance of rainfed areas and animal agriculture on productivity enhancement and food security for economic rural growth in Asia is discussed in the context of opportunities for increasing potential contribution from them. The extent of the rainfed area of about 223 million hectares and the biophysical attributes are described. They have been variously referred to inter alia as fragile, marginal, dry, waste, problem, threatened, range, less favoured, low potential lands, forests and woodlands, including lowlands and uplands. Of these, the terms less favoured areas (LFAs), and low or high potential are quite widely used. The LFAs are characterised by four key features: i) very variable biophysical elements, notably poor soil quality, rainfall, length of growing season and dry periods, ii) extreme poverty and very poor people who continuously face hunger and vulnerability, iii) presence of large populations of ruminant animals (buffaloes, cattle, goats and sheep), and iv) have had minimum development attention and an unfinished wanting agenda. The rainfed humid/sub-humid areas found mainly in South East Asia (99 million ha), and arid/semi-arid tropical systems found in South Asia (116 million ha) are priority agro-ecological zones (AEZs). In India for example, the ecosystem occupies 68% of the total cultivated area and supports 40% of the human and 65% of the livestock populations. The area also produces 4% of food requirements. The biophysical and typical household characteristics, agricultural diversification, patterns of mixed farming and cropping systems are also described. Concerning animals, their role and economic importance, relevance of ownership, nomadic movements, and more importantly their potential value as the entry point for the development of LFAs is discussed. Two examples of demonstrated success concern increasing buffalo production for milk and their expanded use in semi-arid AEZs in India, and the integration of cattle and goats with oil palm in Malaysia. Revitalised development of the LFAs is justified by the demand for agricultural land to meet human needs e.g. housing, recreation and industrialisation; use of arable land to expand crop production to ceiling levels; increasing and very high animal densities; increased urbanisation and pressure on the use of available land; growing environmental concerns of very intensive crop production e.g. acidification and salinisation with rice cultivation; and human health risks due to expanding pen-urban poultry and pig production. The strategies for promoting productivity growth will require concerted R and D on improved use of LFAs, application of systems perspectives for technology delivery, increased investments, a policy framework and improved farmer-researcher-extension linkages. These challenges and their resolution in rainfed areas can forcefully impact on increased productivity, improved livelihoods and human welfare, and environmental sustainability in the future.

AB  - Aim: The study aimed at evaluating of an appropriate nutrient management practice for increasing greengram productivity, improving soil health, and thus bringing sustainability to pulse production system in the hilly terrains of North East India. Methodology: Afield experiment was conducted during 2013 and 2014 to evaluate the effect of vermicompost, Rhizobium and lime in different combination with fertilizers on greengram productivity and soil health under terrace land situation of Meghalaya. Treatments comprised of recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF), 50% RDF + Rhizobium, 50% RDF + Rhizobium + lime 4 q ha(-1),50 % RDF + Vermicompost (VC)2.5 t ha(-1), 50% RDF +lime 4 q ha-1 and 50 % RDF + VC 2.5 t ha(-1) +lime 4 q ha(-1). Results: Nutrient management practices significantly influenced the yield components, yield, soil nutrient status, as well as microbial population in soils. Integrated use of 50% RDF + VC 2.5 tha(-1) + lime 4 q ha(-1) resulted in significantly higher yield of greengram (10 q ha(-1)) and improved the soil organic carbon (2.5 %), bacterial and fungal population, pH and available N, P2O5 and K2O compared to recommended dose of fertilizer applied alone. Interpretation: The results of the study indicated that the integrated use of 50 % RDF with vermicompost 2.5 t ha(-1) and lime 4 q ha(-1) is profitable for enhancing greengram productivity and improving soil health under hilly ecosystem of North East India.

AB  - In the literature on how to make food systems just and sustainable, we often look at Alternative Food Networks (AFN) as a way forward. AFNs are initiatives that pose alternatives to conventional food systems (driven by productivism and harmful to human and environmental health). Despite this broad understanding of what AFNs can be, in practice, most cases presented in the literature look surprisingly alike. In this article, we challenge the scholars working on alternative food networks to look beyond the narrow definition of AFNs by considering cases of traditional agriculture and distribution systems. We illustrate this argument using the case of chinampas, a traditional agricultural system in Mexico City that contributes in different ways to local sustainability. Analysing semi-structured interviews conducted on site, we argue that chinampas can be defined as an alternative food network because of their modes of production, their diverse distribution channels, and their economic practices. We conclude that traditional food systems present an alternative to conventional food systems and should therefore be included in AFN research. Broadening the definition of AFNs so to include traditional and non-institutional practices can help identify diverse cases fitting this new lens, including in the Global North; it can also contribute to affirming the value of these traditional systems in building sustainable and just societies.

AB  - Increasing food production without further harming biodiversity is a key challenge of contemporary societies. In this paper, we assess trade-offs between agricultural output and two key agri-environmental indicators in four contrasting scenarios for Europe in 2040. The scenarios represent different storylines encompassing assumptions on macro-economic drivers (e.g. population and GDP growth rate), demand for food and livestock products as well as policy choices on trade liberalisation/protectionism, biodiversity conservation, regulations on land-use planning and subsidies to farmers through the European Union (EU) Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Through a complex modelling chain, we projected for the year 2040: i) the total energy content of agricultural output; ii) the total nitrogen surplus, a proxy of the overall impact of agriculture on the environment; and iii) an index measuring the capacity of agricultural systems to support biodiversity. We present both aggregate results (EU level) and spatially explicit assessments at a fine resolution (1 km(2)). Results indicate that a strong neo-liberal approach to agriculture (full liberalisation, abolition of subsides) will lead to increased use-input efficiency and decrease of impact from Nitrogen input; however, a large amount of agricultural area in Europe will be abandoned, which will lead to an absolute decrease in production and increased land homogenisation and polarisation, with negative effects on the capacity of agricultural areas to support biodiversity. Protectionist and sovereigntist policies will keep absolute production and cultivated area high, but at the cost of less efficiency in the use of inputs and higher impacts on the environment and biodiversity. Under a scenario characterised by environmental-friendly practices, multifunctional landscapes and localism, significant decreases in the environmental pressure of agriculture (compared to other scenarios) can be achieved with minimum decrease in agricultural output. Our results indicate that agricultural and land-use policies aiming at preserving production over large rural areas, multifunctionality and diversification of agricultural landscapes can contribute to the jointly achievement of biodiversity protection and high food production.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Qualitative studies have suggested that food insecurity adversely affects infant feeding practices. We aimed to determine how household food insecurity relates to breastfeeding initiation, duration of exclusive breastfeeding and vitamin D supplementation of breastfed infants in Canada. METHODS: We studied 10 450 women who had completed the Maternal Experiences Breastfeeding Module and the Household Food Security Survey Module of the Canadian Community Health Survey (2005-2014) and who had given birth in the year of or year before their interview. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models and logistic regression to examine the relation between food insecurity and infant feeding practices, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, maternal mood disorders and diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: Overall, 17% of the women reported household food insecurity, of whom 8.6% had moderate food insecurity and 2.9% had severe food insecurity (weighted percentages). After adjustment for sociodemographic factors, women with food insecurity were no less likely than others to initiate breastfeeding or provide vitamin D supplementation to their infants. Half of the women with food insecurity ceased exclusive breastfeeding by 2 months, whereas most of those with food security persisted with breastfeeding for 4 months or more. Relative to women with food security, those with marginal, moderate and severe food insecurity had significantly lower odds of exclusive breastfeeding to 4 months, but only women with moderate food insecurity had lower odds of exclusive breastfeeding to 6 months, independent of sociodemographic characteristics (odds ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.39-0.92). Adjustment for maternal mood disorder or diabetes slightly attenuated these relationships. INTERPRETATION: Mothers caring for infants in food-insecure households attempted to follow infant feeding recommendations, but were less able than women with food security to sustain exclusive breastfeeding. Our findings highlight the need for more effective interventions to support food-insecure families with newborns.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed and amplified food insecurity in marginalized communities of color, revealing systemic health and socioeconomic inequalities. Given the role that religious organizations play in building social capital, disseminating information to local communities, and facilitating the distribution of basic necessities such as food, they are integrally involved in short- and long-term solutions to food insecurity. Yet, literature on the role of religious institutions for mitigating food insecurity is limited. The literature related to methods and means by which religious organizations engage community efforts to mitigate food security as well as studies in food sovereignty will be reviewed.

AB  - Intensification,of crop production in the mountains has long been perceived as unsustainable. However, since the late 1980s has become increasingly evident that decline and collapse are not always inevitable. The present article provides examples from the highlands of northern Thailand to show that local food security can be improved while impacts on the resource base and the environment are minimized. This was achieved with the help of cropping systems developed and adapted by farmers themselves (Figure 1). Studying farmers' management techniques will allow this success to be repeated elsewhere, but only if it is based on the idea of dynamic variation in cropping system management that occurs within and between mountain agroecosystems, defined as agrodiversity.

AB  - Context: The COVID-19 pandemic has been affecting health and economies across the world, although the nature of direct and indirect effects on Asian agrifood systems and food security has not yet been well understood. Objectives: This paper assesses the initial responses of major farming and food systems to COVID-19 in 25 Asian countries, and considers the implications for resilience, food and nutrition security and recovery policies by the governments. Methods: A conceptual systems model was specified including key pathways linking the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 to the resilience and performance of the four principal Asian farming and food systems, viz, lowland rice based; irrigated wheat based; hill mixed; and dryland mixed systems. Based on this framework, a systematic survey of 2504 key informants (4% policy makers, 6% researchers or University staff, 6% extension workers, 65% farmers, and 19% others) in 20 Asian countries was conducted and the results assessed and analysed. Results and conclusion: The principal Asian farming and food systems were moderately resilient to COVID-19, reinforced by government policies in many countries that prioritized food availability and affordability. Rural livelihoods and food security were affected primarily because of disruptions to local labour markets (especially for off-farm work), farm produce markets (notably for perishable foods) and input supply chains (i.e., seeds and fertilisers). The overall effects on system performance were most severe in the irrigated wheat based system and least severe in the hill mixed system, associated in the latter case with greater resilience and diversification and less dependence on external inputs and long market chains. Farming and food systems' resilience and sustain ability are critical considerations for recovery policies and programmes, especially in relation to economic performance that initially recovered more slowly than productivity, natural resources status and social capital. Overall, the resilience of Asian farming and food systems was strong because of inherent systems characteristics reinforced by public policies that prioritized staple food production and distribution as well as complementary welfare programmes. With the substantial risks to plant-and animal-sourced food supplies from future zoonoses and the institutional vulnerabilities revealed by COVID-19, efforts to improve resilience should be central to recovery programmes. Significance: This study was the first Asia-wide systems assessment of the effects of COVID-19 on agriculture and food systems, differentiating the effects of the pandemic across the four principal regional farming and food systems in the region.

AB  - Environmental science is shaped by the socio-political context in which it is produced. Environmental problems and explanations are context specific, and this article contributes to a critical political ecology by illustrating the changing relationship between conceptualisation of environmental problems and explanations of them, and the socio-political context in contemporary Thailand. During the 'development epoch' from the 1950s, both natural and social sciences became compartmentalised and the epistemology of environmental science became dominated by the demands of a growth economy and utilitarian values. The resulting impasse of conventional knowledge of natural resource management coincided with a socio-political and bureaucratic reform process pushed by various democratic movements. Together with a request for decentralisation and devolution of state power, these movements are also fighting for sustainable utilisation of natural resources, and sustainable agricultural practices. A precondition, however, for sustainable utilisation of natural resources is a change in conceptualisation and knowledge creation for resource management. The Sustainable Land Use and Natural Resource Management (SLUSE) collaboration offers alternative ways of creating knowledge for sustainable utilisation of natural resources, that aim to support the present socio-political reform process in Thailand.

AB  - The transition to a more sustainable livestock sector represents one of the major challenges of our time. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is recognised as the gold standard methodology for assessing the environmental impact of farming systems. Simultaneously, animal welfare is a key component of livestock production and is intrinsically related to human and environmental well-being. To perform an overall onfarm sustainability assessment, it would be desirable to consider both the environmental impact and the welfare of the animals. The present work aimed to summarise and describe the methodologies adopted in peer-reviewed papers published to date, that combine animal welfare evaluation with LCA. Citations, retrieved from four bibliographical databases, were systematically evaluated in a multi-stage approach following the JBI and PRISMA scoping review guidelines. The searches identified 1 460 studies, of which only 24 were compliant with the inclusion criteria. The results highlighted how the environmental LCA was undertaken with a much more homogenous and standardised method than animal welfare assessment. When studies were grouped based on the type of animal welfare assessment performed: 16.7% used single welfare indicators, 45.8% multiple indicators, 8.3% applied existing validated protocols (i.e., TGI-200 and TGI-35L), 16.7% used non-validated protocols and 12.5% employed other methods. The papers were further classified with respect to the "5 Animal Welfare Domains Model": the most assessed domain was "environment" (90.5% of the papers%), followed by "health" (52.4%), "nutrition" (33.3%), "behavioural interactions" (28.6%) and "mental state" (9.5%). None of the studies assessed all the domains simultaneously. In addition, 66.7% of papers (n = 16) aggregated the animal welfare indicators into a final score. Within these, only four papers proposed to associate the animal welfare scores with the LCA functional unit. An overall sustainability score, calculated with several different approaches to summarise the information, was provided by 46% of the papers. In summary, despite the topic's relevance, to date, there is neither a consensus on the animal welfare assessment approach to be carried out (indicators selection and their aggregation) nor on the standardisation of an integrated animal welfare-LCA evaluation. The present review provides a basis for the development of common future guidelines to carry out a comprehensive, true-to-life and robust farm sustainability assessment. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Sustainable production of paddy rice is essential in supplying staple food worldwide. In the present study, we determined annual yield, greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) and carbon footprint of double cropping paddy rice (Oryza sativa L.) as impacted by organic and inorganic amendments in a 38-year study from central China. A balanced synthetic fertilizer of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) combined with rice straw application (NPK_RS) consistently produced higher annual grain yield by 5%, 11% and 64%, respectively, compared with NPK, anaerobically digested manure (NKM) and NK. Average GHGs associated with both early -and late-season rice production were 47,300 kg CO2eq ha-1 yr-1 for the NPK_RS, 24,100 kg CO2eq ha-1 yr-1 for the NPK, 27,700 kg CO2eq ha-1 yr-1 for the NKM, 24,300 kg CO2eq ha-1 yr-1 for the NK, and 20,400 kg CO2eq ha-1 yr-1 for the non-fertilized control (CK). Of the total GHGs, approximately from 80% to 95% of the emissions resulted from methane fluxes, and from 3% to 7% emitted as soil nitrous oxide while only from 2% to 15% of the total emissions derived from other sources such as fertilizer, herbicide and pesticide production and field operation. As a result, carbon footprint of paddy rice varied from 2.1 to 3.9 kg CO2eq kg-1 grain. Straw addition with the NPK improved rice yield only marginally, but increased methane emissions and carbon footprint significantly, compared with the NPK. On the other hand, the NKM increased rice yield by 48% and GHGs by 10% and lowered carbon footprint by 23%, compared with the NK. Timing of straw application and manure amendments are critical for improving yield of paddy rice, reducing GHGs, and lowering carbon footprint.

AB  - Biomass from agricultural land is a key component of any sustainable bioenergy strategy, and 2nd generation, ligno-cellulosic feedstocks are part of the UK government policy to meet the target of reduced CO2 emission. Pre-harvest estimates of the biomass supply potential are usually based on experimental evidence and little is known about the yield gap between biologically obtainable and actual achievable on-farm biomass yields. We propose a systematic integration of mapped information fit for estimating obtainable yields using an empirical model, observed on-farm yields and remote sensing. Thereby, one can identify the sources of yield variation and supply uncertainty. Spatially explicit Miscanthus potential yields are compared with delivered on-farm yields from established crops >= 5 years after planting, surveyed among participants in the Energy Crop Scheme. Actual on-farm yield averaged at 8.94 Mg ha(-1) and it varied greatly (coefficient of variation 34%), largely irrespective of soil type. The average yield gap on clay soils was much larger than that on sandy or loamy soils (37% vs 10%). Miscanthus is noticeably slower to establish on clay soils as shown by fitting a logistic Gompertz equation to yield time series. However, gaps in crop cover as identified by density counts, visual inspection (Google Earth) and remote sensing (Landsat-5) correlated with observed on-farm yields suggesting patchiness as causal for reduced yields. The analysis shows ways to improve the agronomy for these new crops to increase economic returns within the supply chain and the environmental benefits (reduced GHG emission, greater carbon sequestration) and reduce the land demand of bio-energy production.

AB  - With the advent of globalization, one of the most visible impacts of it can be seen in food practice of indigenous tribes; tremendously transition of traditional food taking place. The changes have its own merit and demerit aspect. Firstly, it has improved the food security of the tribal people on the other hand, due to food transition and lifestyle new health problem has been experiencing by the tribal people. Further, traditional food such as smoked meat aggravates the chronic diseases. The result shows that 42.8 percent of the respondents consume smoke meat 2or3 times in weeks and 54.4 percent of the respondents take traditional dish almost daily, which is exceeding the recommended quantity.

AB  - The problem of drought in India is a major issue in terms of various adverse impacts on livelihood of society. Drought Early Warning System (DEWS), a real-time drought-monitoring tool, has reported that over a fifth of India's geographical area (21.06 %) is suffering drought-like situations. This is 62 % larger than the drought-affected area during the same period last year, which was 7.86 %. Drought affects 21.06 %, with conditions ranging from unusually dry to extremely dry. While 1.63 % and 1.73% of the area are experiencing 'extreme' or 'exceptional' dry conditions, 2.17% is experiencing `severe' dry conditions. Under `moderate' dry circumstances, up to 8.15 % is possible. In this perspective groundwater vulnerability assessment in the overall country is needed for implementing the sustainable and long-term strategies for escaping from this type of hazardous situation. The main objective of this study is to estimate the drought vulnerability in changing climate which eventually influences the food security of India. The groundwater overdraft is one of the crucial elements in agricultural drought vulnerability. Various related parameters have been selected for estimating the drought vulnerability and its impact to food security in India. Here, MaxEnt (maximumentropy) andANN (analytical neural network) has been considered in this perspective. The AUC values for the training datasets in the ANN and MaxEnt model are 0.891 and 0.921, respectively. The AUC values in ANN and MaxEnt model for the validation datasets are 0.876 and 0.904, respectively. Here MaxEnt model is most optimal than ANN considering predictive accuracy. From this study analysis it is established that western, south and middle portion of country is very much prone to drought vulnerability. So, special emphases in terms of the regional planning have to be taken into consideration for sustainable planning.

AB  - In this paper a system dynamics model for organic farming development to support government decision making is presented. The system incorporates relevant variables which affect organic farming development. The user seeks answers to strategic questions related to the level of organic farming development achievable in a long term dynamic horizon. The model's basic structure is fully described and results are presented which show that the conversion process relies mainly on subsidies and self-organization resources. User can simulate different policy scenarios for organic farming and for assessing their impact on the economic and environmental parameters of organic production at aggregate level. After performing several simulation scenarios we discovered that conversion to organic farming relies on subsidies which provide the main motivation for conversion from conventional farming to organic farming. However, the subsidies are not the only driving force in the system, even more important are activities that promote organic farming, since sufficiently large subsidies could not be provided in order to complete the conversion from conventional to organic farming to the extent desired. Another important feature is food demand, determined by population size, which negatively influences the conversion to organic farming due to the increased demand leading to increased food prices.

AB  - This paper examines local farmers' perspectives about emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) of humans, crops and livestock and their impact on household food security in the Tanzania-Uganda interface ecosystem to the west of Lake Victoria. While it is increasingly accepted that such an approach could yield vital information not only regarding the extent of the impact of EIDs but also on practical strategies for their control, recent studies have examined only a narrow part of the disease-food security spectrum, often lacking a clear analysis of how local people conceptualise the co-occurrence, interactions and impact on food security of multiple plant, animal and human disease afflictions. Findings of the present study reveal that farmers perceive diseases as products of wider social, economic, environmental and institutional realities. They employ a wide range of names to describe disease problems and often such labels have nothing in common with the binomial nomenclature used in scientific taxonomy. Frequently, local people's perceptions of severity of the impact of disease on food security are at variance with views held by experts. Consequently, disease control measures and strategies advocated by experts and policy makers are often not adhered to. This paper reveals that local or emic perspectives on diseases not only convey the sense of how local people feel and think about a particular disease but also how such knowledge shapes their response effort. Finally, the paper argues for a strategy to harness and incorporate aspects of local perspectives and practices into formal disease control programmes.

AB  - Background: Older adults with food-related physical functioning limitations often face food insecurity because of challenges that go beyond resource constraints. Difficulties with food acquisition at retailers, and food preparation and consumption are not captured by the United States Department of Agriculture's food security measure. Objectives: The objective of this study was to develop a method to assess the overall prevalence of food insecurity regardless of underlying cause using validated measures that capture both food-related physical functioning limitations and resource-constraint food hardships. It also aims to examine the validity of this method in relation to sociodemographic characteristics, health, appetite, and dietary outcomes. Methods: Using information from National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (2007-2018), 10,237 adults aged 60 y and older with complete food security and food-related physical functioning limitations data were included in the study. Comparisons of the cross- classification method and the standard food security methods are made and their relationships with depression, self-reported health, and healthy eating index 2015 are examined using multiple linear regression models. Results: Using the cross-classification method, prevalence of low and very low food security because of resource constraints and food- related physical functioning limitations was found to be higher (13.6% and 7.3%, respectively) compared with food insecurity based solely on resource constraints (4.7% and 3.3%, respectively) or food-related physical functioning limitations (11.4% and 4.4%). Low and very low food security levels using the cross-classification method were associated with higher odds of depression and poor self-reported health, compared with the standard United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) resource-constrained food security measure. Conclusions: The cross-classification method enables the identification of potentially food insecure older adults who might be classified otherwise if only each measure is used alone. This method serves as guidance for using both measures jointly to estimate food insecurity, regardless of its cause.

AB  - Climate change, influenced by both natural processes and human activities, has notably transformed Earth's atmospheric composition, primarily due to heightened energy use in industrial and agricultural sectors. To combat this, a study was conducted focusing on soil management strategies, particularly using cumbu napier hybrid grass, to mitigate climate change by enhancing carbon sequestration. The research evaluated the effects of different nutrient sources including inorganic fertilizers, farmyard manure (FYM), poultry manure (PM) and biofertilizers like Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and Azophos on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, soil carbon pools and soil organic carbon (SOC). The findings revealed that integrating organic manures with biofertilizers, particularly in the treatment involving PM at 75 % nitrogen equivalent combined with AM and Azophos (T10), significantly increased SOC levels (1.04 %) and lowered GHG emissions. This treatment also recorded the highest levels of soil inorganic carbon (0.131 %), passive carbon (7890 mg kg-1), permanent soil carbon stock (14.91 t ha-1 green fodder yield (370.2 t ha-1 year-1). On the other hand, the treatment with FYM alone at 100 % nitrogen equivalent (T7) resulted in the highest CO2 emissions (71.4 t ha-1 year-1), while the untreated control plot (T11) exhibited the highest global warming potential (GWP). This study underscores the effectiveness of strategic soil management in forage crop systems as a sustainable method to boost soil health, increase carbon sequestration and reduce GHG emissions, thus contributing to climate change mitigation.

AB  - Based on Ian Steedman's seminal contribution Consumption Takes Time', we propose a formal activity-based model for consumer behaviour. The model simultaneously incorporates choices over consumption time, as well as quantities and qualities of products consumed. We identify and examine preconditions for satiation with products and draw implications for economic policy. Satiation with products explains the limited effects of price or income changes on demand and questions the pertinence of economic growth for development. It further highlights the relevance of working time reductions for well-being.

AB  - We confirmed that multiple phase equilibration could be applied to the simultaneous determination of the concentrations of dissolved N2O, CH4, and CO2. To investigate the presence of indirect greenhouse gas emissions, we measured the concentrations of dissolved N2O, CH4, and CO2 in pipe drainage, seepage, and stream water in a livestock farm located in Hokkaido, Japan. Large spatial and seasonal variations in the gas concentrations in the pipe drainage and seepage were observed: the concentrations of the dissolved gases ranged from 0.06 to 95.2 mug N2O-N L-1, from 0.03 to 3,400 mug CH4-C L-1, and from 3.34 to 53.9 mg CO2-C L-1. Almost all the concentrations were supersaturated, indicating the possibility of indirect N2O, CH4, and CO2 emissions from the farm. The N2O and CO2 concentrations in the stream water were near equilibrium with ambient air and were almost constant from the upstream to the downstream. However, the concentration of dissolved CH, was remarkably higher in the lower part of the stream, suggesting that there may be a relatively strong indirect CH4 emission from the drainage in the lower part of the farm.

AB  - The relative importance of reduced soil disturbance and increased food supply in supporting large earthworm populations in cereal-legume intercropping systems was investigated in two replicated field experiments over a 3-year period. In the first experiment, the effects of the absence of tillage and the presence of a permanent white clover understorey on earthworm populations were assessed in three winter wheat cropping systems. The mean earthworm abundance as assessed by electrical extraction in conventional wheat, direct drilled wheat and direct-drilled wheat-clover intercrops was 211, 280 and 572 individuals m(-2) and the corresponding earthworm biomass was 62, 92 and 203 g m(-2). In the second experiment, the effects of dairy cattle slurry and mineral fertilizer applications on earthworm populations in wheat-clover intercropping systems were assessed. Neither the input of additional organic matter (as slurry) nor mineral N fertilization increased earthworm population levels which were already remarkably high, averaging 1097 individuals m(-2) and 266 g biomass m(-2) in the third year of the experiment. These results suggest that while the absence of ploughing alone had only a modest effect, the combination of absence of ploughing and presence of a clover understorey increased earthworm populations greatly. It is concluded that cereal-legume intercrops support large earthworm populations primarily because the organic matter input from such systems is favourable for earthworms in terms of quantity, quality and continuity of food supply throughout the year.

AB  - Irrigation consumes three quarters of global water withdrawals each year. Strategies are needed to reduce irrigation water use, including increasing the efficiency of transfer methods and field application. Comprehensive restoration of soil health, specifically through organic matter amendments, can substantially reduce irrigation demand and increase crop yield. A program to restore severely degraded and desertified soils by incorporating coarse woodchips into the soil successfully increased rainfall capture and elevated soil moisture for several weeks between rainfall events at both Ningxia, north-west China and North Dakota, USA. With addition of fertilizer, woodchip incorporation further increased growth of wheat and alfalfa. Comprehensive soil health assessment of remnant grasslands was used to develop target reference soil profiles by which to guide restoration efforts. Given that most agricultural soils are degraded to some degree, soil health restoration can provide a powerful strategy toward achieving global food and water security.

AB  - Over the last two decades, scholars and organizations across the world have carried out research projects and promoted dissemination tools aimed at promoting food and food-related elements embedded in local and traditional foodways. In this regard, the documentation of food and biocultural heritage has been seen as the starting point of processes directed toward their safeguarding and promotion. Drawing from this premise, the paper presents an original methodological approach, designed within the framework of the Ark of Taste project, to map, inventory, and document food and food-related resources to produce a comprehensive dissemination tool for the promotion of local food and biocultural heritage. To this end, the paper discusses the case study of the Atlas of the Ark of Taste in Tanzania, looking at the approach used, and the challenges faced, in undertaking field and desk activities aimed at inventorying Tanzanian food products and in the creating of the gastronomic atlas of this country. Drawing from this experience, the paper highlights the potentially crucial role that food and gastronomic inventories may have in achieving UN Sustainable Development Goals from a grassroots perspective. Acknowledging the limitations and possible unintended effects of these initiatives on the protection of food and biocultural resources, the authors recognize the promising role that these tools could have in fostering the achievement of environmental (SDGs 13, 14, 15) and social sustainability (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 10) objectives.

AB  - Cover crops are considered to be beneficial for multiple ecosystem services, and they have been widely promoted through the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in the EU and Farm Bill Conservation Title Programs, such as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), in the USA. However, it can be difficult to decide whether the beneficial effects of cover crops on some ecosystem services are likely to outweigh their harmful effects on other services, and thus to decide whether they should be promoted by agricultural policy in specific situations. We used meta-analysis to quantify the effects of cover crops on five ecosystem services (food production, climate regulation, soil and water regulation, and weed control) in arable farmland in California and the Mediterranean, based on 326 experiments reported in 57 publications. In plots with cover crops, there was 13% less water, 9% more organic matter and 41% more microbial biomass in the soil, 27% fewer weeds, and 15% higher carbon dioxide emissions (but also more carbon stored in soil organic matter), compared to control plots with bare soils or winter fallows. Cash crop yields were 16% higher in plots that had legumes as cover crops (compared to controls) but 7% lower in plots that had non-legumes as cover crops. Soil nitrogen content was 41% lower, and nitrate leaching was 53% lower, in plots that had non-legume cover crops (compared to controls) but not significantly different in plots that had legumes. We did not find enough data to quantify the effects of cover crops on biodiversity conservation, pollination, or pest regulation. These gaps in the evidence need to be closed if cover crops continue to be widely promoted. We suggest that this novel combination of multiple meta-analyses for multiple ecosystem services could be used to support multi-criteria decision making about agri-environmental policy.

AB  - The effects of four levels of food supply (0.5%, 1%, 2% and 3% body weight daily) were investigated on some reproductive traits and growth of hybrid tilapia in outdoor concrete tanks. Fast-growing fish matured early in the season (March), but spawning started late in May. Smallest size of males and females at first maturity was? 8.1 cm. Fish size at maturity appears to be influenced by the feeding lever, which affects the growth of fish. For both sexes, no significant difference was found in gonadosomatic index (GSI) among different treatments. Mean percentage of mature fish decreased with decreasing food supply and was found to be significantly different between fishes fed at 3% (46%) and 0.5% (28%) body weight. Fecundity increased with increased feeding levels, although significant differences were found only between 3% and other feeding rates (0.5-2.0%). The fecundity per g female was higher at the lower ration levels (0.5% and 1%) than at the higher feeding levels. Egg quality, with respect to egg size, hatchability, fry length and weight, was not affected by the feeding rates. Final mean weight and food conversion ratios were significantly influenced by feeding rates. Higher increase in ovary weight with increasing body weight: of mature females fed at 0.5% body weight than fishes receiving higher food levels suggests that in these fish, more food resources are diverted towards gonad building than to somatic growth.

AB  - Approximately half of the tropical biome is in some stage of recovery from past human disturbance, most of which is in secondary forests growing on abandoned agricultural lands and pastures. Reforestation of these abandoned lands, both natural and managed, has been proposed as a means to help offset increasing carbon emissions to the atmosphere. In this paper we discuss the potential of these forests to serve as sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide in aboveground biomass and soils. A review of literature data shows that aboveground biomass increases at a rate of 6.2 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) during the first 20 years of succession, and at a rate of 2.9 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) over the first 80 years of regrowth. During the first 20 years of regrowth, forests in wet life zones have the fastest rate of aboveground carbon accumulation with reforestation, followed by dry and moist forests. Soil carbon accumulated at a rate of 0.41 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) over a 100-year period, and at faster rates during the first 20 years (1.30 Mg carbon ha(-1) yr(-1)). Past land use affects the rate of both above- and belowground carbon sequestration. Forests growing on abandoned agricultural land accumulate biomass faster than other past land uses, while soil carbon accumulates faster on sites that were cleared but not developed, and on pasture sites. Our results indicate that tropical reforestation has the potential to serve as a carbon offset mechanism both above- and belowground for at least 40 to 80 years, and possibly much longer. More research is needed to determine the potential for longer-term carbon sequestration for mitigation of atmospheric CO2 emissions.

AB  - In a productive vineyard, the influence of different soil management practices on carbon sequestration and its dynamic in water-stable aggregates of Rendzin Leptosol was studied. In 2006, an experiment of different management practices in a productive vineyard was established in the locality of Nitra-Draovce, in the Nitra winegrowing area of Slovakia. The following treatments were established: (1) control (grass without fertilization); (2) T (tillage); (3) T+FM (tillage+farmyard manure); (4) G+NPK3 (grass+NPK 120-55-195 kgha(-1)); and (5) G+NPK1 (grass+NPK 80-35-135 kgha(-1)). The results showed that the lowest soil organic matter content (9.70 gkg(-1)) in water-stable microaggregates was determined in G+NPK3, as well as in T. However, the highest soil organic matter content in the highest size fractions of water-stable macroaggregates (>5mm) was observed in T+FM (19.7 g kg(-1)). The highest value for carbon sequestration capacity in water-stable microaggregates was observed in the ploughed farmyard manure treatment. However, the control treatment showed the highest values for carbon sequestration capacity in water-stable macroaggregates, including agronomically favourable size fractions (0.5-3 mm). In all soil management practices under a productive vineyard the most intensive changes in the soil organic matter content were observed in the highest size fractions (>3mm) of water-stable macroaggregates.

AB  - The risks of climate change and soil degradation for the agricultural environment and crop production are increasingly prominent. Based on the limitations of land resources, it is important to explore a sustainable and effective fertilization strategy to reduce risks and ensure there is a high yield of grain and sustainable development of agriculture. Soil fertility underpins cultivated land, which is the most important resource of agricultural production, and is also the key for maintaining agricultural sustainability. The central elements of soil fertility are soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil nitrogen (SN). This study applied the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer-Cropping System Model (DSSAT-CSM) and the CENTURY-based soil module to simulate the trends of crop yields, SN storages and SOC storages until the end of this century under different climate change circumstances, based on a 36-year long-term experiment established at Shenyang site, China. Four fertilizer practices were applied: control (CK), combined chemical fertilizer of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK), NPK with manure (MNPK), and NPK fertilizers plus a high application rate of manure (hMNPK). The outcomes indicated that the DSSAT model can fully simulate the yields of maize and soybean as well as the dynamic stocks of the SN and SOC. Three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5) for future development were chosen from the fifth assessment report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Moreover, a baseline was installed. Crop yields, SN, and SOC storages from 2016 to 2100 were estimated under four climate scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5, and Baseline). The RCP scenarios in some treatments reduced SN and SOC stocks and maize yield, and had no effect on soybean yield. However, the application of NPK with manure could improve crop yields, while it increased SN and SOC storages substantially. To some extent, the negative effects of climate scenarios could be mitigated by applying manure. In the RCP 4.5, maize yields of NPK, MNPK, and hMNPK treatments declined by 14.8%, 7.7%, and 6.2%, respectively, compared with that of NPK under Baseline. The NPK fertilizers plus manure treatments could cut the reduction of maize yield caused by climate change in half. Additionally, the SOC storage and SN of chemical fertilizers plus manure treatments under RCP scenarios increased by 20.2%-33.5% and 13.7%-21.7% compared with that of NPK under baseline, respectively. It was concluded that a rational combination of organic and inorganic fertilizer applications is a sustainable and effective agricultural measure to maintain food security and relieve environmental stresses.

AB  - Crop models are crucial in assessing the reliability and sustainability of soil water conservation practices. The AquaCrop model was tested and validated for maize productivity under the selected climate smart agriculture (CSA) practices in the rainfed production systems. The model was validated using final biomass (B) and grain yield (GY) data from field experiments involving seven CSA practices (halfmoon pits, 2 cm thick mulch, 4 cm thick mulch, 6 cm thick mulch, 20 cm deep permanent planting basins (PPB), and 30 cm deep) and the control (conventional practice) where no CSA was applied. Statistics for coefficient of determination (R-2), Percent bias (Pbias), and Nash-Sutcliffe (E) for B and GY indicate that the AquaCrop model was robust to predict crop yield and biomass as illustrated by the value of R-2 > 0.80, Pbias -1.52-1.25% and E > 0.68 for all the CSA practices studied. The relative changes between the actual and simulated water use efficiency (WUE) of grain yield was observed in most of the CSA practices. However, measured WUE was seemingly better in the 2 cm thick mulch, indicating a potential for water saving and yield improvement. Therefore, the AquaCrop model is recommended as a reliable tool for assessing the effectiveness of the selected CSA practices for sustainable and improved maize production; although, the limitations in severely low soil moisture conditions and water stressed environments should be further investigated considering variations in agroecological zones.

AB  - Rice (Oryza sativa L) paddy soils have the potential to emit both of the greenhouse gases methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), depending on redox potential. Results from incubation studies with homogenized soil led to a proposed "healthy redox potential" range that minimizes both CH4 and N2O emission. We examined whether controlled irrigation with the water-saving practice of "safe alternate wetting and drying" (AWD) could maintain a healthy redox potential throughout the rooting layer of rice paddy soil in a greenhouse experiment without plants. We hypothesized that a surface redox potential for N2O and a rooting-depth redox potential for CH4 would both be important in determining gas emissions, making it difficult to minimize rice paddy greenhouse gas emissions through water management. We monitored gas emission for 7 weeks from soil treated by continuous flooding, AWD, or "healthy redox" water management, with and without rice residue incorporation, with no fertilizer application. Nitrous oxide, after the initial flush, was emitted only when the redox potential at 2-cm soil depth was above + 140 mV. Methane was emitted even when the 7.5-cm redox potential was above -150 mV. Measurement of dissolved CH4 in soil solution confirmed that there was 17 to 100 times more methane at 20-cm depth than 7.5 cm. with no significant differences between water treatments at 20 cm (P<0.05). The AWD treatment emitted significantly more N2O than the continuously flooded treatment (P<0.05), while the reverse was true for CH4 (P<0.05). Residue incorporation significantly increased CH4, but not N2O, emission in both water treatments (P<0.05), and thus had more impact than water management. We conclude that simultaneous minimization of both CH4 and N2O emission cannot be maintained in rice soils due to the redox potential changes with depth, but that appropriate water and residue management can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Without residue incorporation, continuous flooding has the lowest combined risk of N2O and CH4 emission, but with residue incorporation, AWD has similar or lower risk. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Societal Impact Statement Climate resilient crops will become increasingly important, especially in regions where smallholder farmers are vulnerable to climate extremes. Enset, a multipurpose perennial staple crop consumed by over 20 million people in Ethiopia, purportedly provides food security during periods of drought. Here, we find evidence that frequent severe drought events led to an increase in enset production area. This is consistent with a broader pattern whereby farmers preferentially cultivate perennial and storable crops after long-term drought events, providing an example of adaptation to fluctuations in climate through crop choice in indigenous agrisystems. Smallholder farms in the semiarid and subhumid tropics are particularly vulnerable to increased climate variability. Indigenous agrisystems that have co-evolved with climate variability may have developed resilience strategies. In the Southwest Ethiopian Highlands, agrisystems are dominated by the multipurpose perennial staple enset (Ensete ventricosum), characterised by flexible harvest timing, high yield, long storage, and putative drought tolerance, earning it the name 'the tree against hunger'. We tested three hypotheses using crop production area and climate data. First, that enset production area is greatest in the most drought-prone locations. Second, that farmers respond to drought events by increasing enset production area. And third, that drought encourages shifts in agrisystem composition more widely towards perennial or storable crops. We found that regions with a higher severe drought frequency are associated with significantly higher proportion of enset production. Similarly, the Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index of the previous 3 years is significantly negatively correlated with enset production area time series, suggesting that prior drier conditions led farmers to increase the land under enset production. Regarding other crops, storage crops roots and tubers were also preferentially selected after long-term drought over annual crops, indicating their capacity for longer-term resilience. Promoting the production of crops such as perennials, which have more extensive and established root systems, may be a strategy to ensure food security during drought or climate variability. These results indicate the potential of farmer's resilience strategies to improve food security in a changing climate.

AB  - Kelps are part of large brown macroalgae species with a fundamental role in temperate to subpolar coastal marine ecosystems and their cultivation has been expanding as part of several efforts and countries ' policies. This study explores the relevance of post-harvesting logistics planning involving marine operations of emerging seaweed-based supply chains including kelp species. In the Irish context, we explore the potential of collaboration among low-tropic ocean farming sectors regarding shared space and infrastructure in rural and remote landscapes. Based on empirical data and a novel methodological approach, a multi-method analysis was performed involving geographic information systems, mathematical modelling and qualitative content analysis. The results indicate large potential production and collaboration capacity if current licensed areas and existing infrastructure were integrated with kelp cultivation for further processing and distribution in 40 local supply hubs and 14 optimal locations for shared processing facilities. Moreover, the different transportation scenarios considered indicate that costs and greenhouse gas emissions could be minimised by reducing moisture content locally and with increased payload. Further linkages reveal uncertainties in the uses of alternative methods of preservation such as ensiling and a lack of attention to non-market values. For future valorisation in diverse commercial and non-commercial applications, seaweed farming and collaborative processing opportunities still need to be incorporated into societal discourses and futures envisioned by rural coastal communities, including the engagement of young generations in such transformation pathways.

AB  - The fast growth of the world population associated with the ever-increasing need for food and the significant contribution of agriculture to anthropogenic global warming is driving the changes from conventional farming approaches to innovative and sustainable agriculture ones. One of these approaches is aquaculture which is founded on the principle of circular economy combining aquaculture and hydroponics in symbiose with aquaculture waste serving as nutrients for plant growth. Conventional Aquaponics has evolved to Aquaponics 4.0 with a fully automated and remote-controlled system for producing foods at an industrial scale. The implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) could simplify farmers' tasks with remote operations while allowing them to achieve automatic and precise control of inputs and outputs as well as to improve the overall efficiency of the system. This review focuses on the use of these smart technologies to analyze, monitor, and maintain good water quality and appropriate replenishment in Aquaponics systems. The identified research gap and future possible contributions in this area are also discussed.

AB  - Agriculture is expected to feed an increasing global population while at the same time meeting demands for renewable energy and the supply of ecosystem services such as provision of nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration. However, the current structure of the agricultural system works against meeting these expectations. The spatial separation of crop and livestock farms has created negative environmental consequences, and bioenergy production has created a trade-off between food and energy production. In this paper, we explore the opportunities for ecological intensification at a regional scale made possible by combining food and energy production. We built three scenarios representing farming systems including biogas production using grass biomass and manure. These scenarios included the following: (a) The current system with energy production (CSE) from non-edible agricultural biomasses (CSE). (b) Agroecological symbiosis (AES) identical to CSE except with 20% of the arable cropping area converted to clover-grasses for use in biogas production. (c) Agroecological symbiosis with livestock (AES-LST) where the available grass biomass (20% as in the AES) is fed to livestock and manure then used as a feedstock in biogas production. In each scenario, nutrients were circulated back to crops in the form of digestate. The supply of soil functions (primary production for food and energy, provision of nutrient cycling, and climate mitigation) and impacts on water quality through nutrient losses in these three scenarios were then compared to the current system. Integrating biogas production into food production resulted in an increased supply of nutrient recycling, reduced nutrient losses, and increased carbon inputs to the soils indicating enhanced climate mitigation. Food production was either not affected (CSE), increased (AES-LST), or decreased (AES), and biogas was produced in substantial quantities in each scenario. Our study demonstrated potential synergies in integrating food and energy production without compromising other ecosystem services in each scenario.

AB  - The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the largest US food and nutrition assistance program, tasked with improving food security among low-income households. Another federal effort to improve food access is the Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI), which invested tens of millions of dollars to incentivize healthy food retail outlets in areas lacking access to nutritious, fresh food. We explore the intersection of these programs, testing the impact of a new, HFFI-financed full-service supermarket on SNAP participants in an urban food desert. After the supermarket's opening, SNAP participants' food security improved and intake of added sugars declined in the intervention neighborhood, but both were unchanged in a comparison neighborhood without a new supermarket. Intervention neighborhood participants also experienced relative declines in the percentage of daily calories from solid fats, alcoholic beverages, and added sugars. Our findings suggest that HFFI amplifies the effects of SNAP participation on improving food security and dietary quality in food deserts.

AB  - The objective of this study is to characterize the social conditions for making agricultural decisions. Particular attention is paid to sustainable agricultural practices in dairy farming. The theoretical framework has been developed around two major explicatory perspectives: sustainable development and quality of life. In the study, we assume that the regional dimension of problems related to the sustainable development of the dairy sector requires solutions adequate to the needs of the regions to create sustainable milk production systems. We put forward a thesis on the impact of objective living conditions of farmers on the readiness to introduce changes in the farm and to apply sustainable agricultural practices. The study has been carried out using the survey method, conducted in a face-to-face interview with fifty farmers engaged in milk production. This study contributes to revealing the role of social sustainability criteria for adopting environmentally friendly farming practices. The novelty of the approach is the use of in-depth sociological analysis in research on the sustainable development of agriculture in small farms (1-5 cows). The results have revealed a significant positive relationship between the assessment of farmers' well-being and the willingness to adopt sustainable agricultural practices. The results also suggest that the analysis of social determinants of agricultural decisions is essential for the implementation of the assumptions of sustainable agriculture. Here we demonstrate that the criteria of subjective well-being can be considered important factors in a positive attitude towards sustainable development and openness to changes in agricultural production.

AB  - Despite the fact that the issue of female poverty is widespread, continuous attempts are made to combat it and advance women's empowerment. To achieve the goals of sustainable development, such as eradicating poverty, attaining gender equality, promoting good jobs and economic growth, and eliminating inequities, creative strategies must be developed. This study focused on the Nigerian Youth and Women Farmers Association in order to examine the effect of social empowerment on alleviating poverty in Nigeria's agricultural sector. Out of the 353 issued questionnaires, 335 were returned and used in this study's investigation. The structural equation model with partial least squares (SEM-PLS) was used to analyse the acquired data. The results showed an important correlation between social empowerment and reductions in poverty among women working in the agricultural sector. This highlights how crucial it is to work together, provide resources, and extend support in order to empower women socially and foster an atmosphere that supports their social and economic advancement. This research recommends that lawmakers, organisations, and governmental entities actively support the empowerment of women in the agricultural sector in order to encourage sustainable farming practices among female entrepreneurs.

AB  - Sustainable intensification (SI) approaches to agricultural development are urgently needed to meet the growing demand for crop staples while protecting ecosystem services and environmental quality. However, SI initiatives have been criticized for neglecting social welfare outcomes. A recent review found that better-off farmers benefitted disproportionately from SI and highlighted the dearth of studies assessing the equity of outcomes. In this study, we explore the social inclusiveness of zero-tillage (ZT) wheat adoption in Bihar, India. ZT is a proven SI technology for enhancing wheat productivity while boosting profitability and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural machinery in the densely populated Indo-Gangetic Plains. With an average landholding size of 0.39 ha, most farmers in Bihar depend on custom-hiring services to access the technology. While service provision models should foster inclusive growth by reducing financial barriers to technology adoption, early evidence suggested that small-holders remained at a disadvantage. Building on this previous research, we use a panel dataset from 961 wheat-growing households that spans a six-year period to analyze ZT adoption dynamics over time while accounting for the role of social networks and access to service provision. Using a heckprobit approach to correct for non-exposure bias, we compare determinants of ZT awareness and use in 2012 and 2015. We apply a multinomial logit model to identify determinants of early adoption, recent adoption, nonadoption, and dis-adoption. Furthermore, we explore the quality of ZT services as an additional dimension of socially-inclusive technology access. We find that the strong initial scale bias in ZT use declined substantially as awareness of the technology increased and the service economy expanded. Land fragmentation replaced total landholding size as a significant adoption determinant, which also affected the quality of ZT services received. Hence, farmers with small but contiguous landholdings appear to have gained a significant degree of access over time. We conclude that early-stage assessments of SI may be misleading, and that private sector-based service provision can contribute to socially inclusive development outcomes as markets mature.

AB  - The covid-19 pandemic has shown how an unpredictable event may affect the sustainability of the entire food supply chain highlighting the need for a sustainable approach to food logistics. While existing literature has focused on production and consumption, little attention has been paid to measuring social sustainability in food transportation. This is a critical gap, as transportation plays a vital role in ensuring the timely and safe delivery of food. This paper proposes a novel approach to measure social sustainability in the context of food logistics within a South European food processing company. The focus is on assessing social procurement practices at the level of logistics suppliers. The methodology developed is based on two levels, seven dimensions, and twenty-one food logistics social sustainability indicators. To validate this, the methodology is adopted to assess the social procurement of five food logistics suppliers (FLS) of a European food company and found significant variations in performance across different dimensions. The results suggest that the dimension in which suppliers perform well are: "characteristics and work welfare", "health of employees", and "human rights implementation and integration". On the other hand, the dimensions that score lowest for all suppliers are "diversity and equal opportunities", "external stakeholder community capital", and "innovation practices". The strength of this methodology lies in its ability to quantify social sustainability in food logistics and its practical implementation within the food logistics company, as well as among its logistics suppliers, in terms of social procurement. The results offer valuable insights and suggestions for the case study food company to improve their consideration of social sustainability aspects in a more comprehensive and effective manner throughout their business operations.

AB  - Background: The global policy discourse on sustainability and health has called for dietary transformations that require diverse, concerted actions from governments and institutions. In this article, we highlight the need to examine sociocultural influences on food practices as precursors to food policy decisions. Discussion: Sociocultural food practices relate to ideas and materials that give rise to food choices and food patterns of a group. We begin with a discussion of how individuals experience, interpret, negotiate, and symbolize the food world around them. We examine primarily the ideational pathways, such as identity, gender, religion, and cultural prohibitions, and their influence on food practices. We then provide guiding questions, frameworks, and a brief overview of food choice values to support policy planning and design. Lastly, we explore how sociocultural change for sustainable or healthy diets is already happening through food movements, food lifestyles, and traditional diets.

AB  - The Indian agriculture is highly vulnerable to climate change which adversely affects crop production and livelihood of farmers. The effect is more intensified in Vindhyan highlands, where prolong drought and high rate of poverty exist in depredation environment. In this context, present study conducted to explore farmers' perception, attitude about climate change and adaptive capabilities. We undertook an interview schedules survey through structured questionnaire in Duddhi block of Sonbhadra district. A total of 400 households were selected in which 347 (86.75%) male and 53 (13.25%) female respondents have participated. The perception of farmers on climate change is presented in SI (severity index) which varies from 36% to 68.63%. The statement 'rainy season decreases' ranked first with SI (68.63%) followed by 'temperature increases' SI (66.06%). This investigation identified 17 types of adaptive practices which are frequently performed in the Vindhyan highlands. Based on the WAI (Weighted Average Index) score, crop diversification (2.0), cultivation of drought-adapted crop varieties (1.99), changing plantation calendar (1.95) were the most adopted practices. Multiple regression analysis between the socio-economic status of farmers and the adaptation practices, recorded a significant positive relationship with age (P < 0.01), family size (P < 0.05), education (P < 0.01), caste categories (P < 0.05) and livestock ownership (P < 0.01) of farmer. This study will be helpful in developing drought resilience farming practices for sustaining the livelihood of farmers and inform policy making.

AB  - Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) is now widely accepted as a policy tool for advancing both ecological and social progress. The Chinese government's Grain to Green Program (GTGP) is the world's largest PES program. It was initiated nearly 20 years ago to reverse previous environmental degradation. However, it is difficult to achieve both conservation and economic "win-win" gains, and care is needed in monitoring environmental and socioeconomic outcomes. Here we choose the Loess Plateau (LP), the area where GTGP was implemented most intensively, to study the social-ecological changes after GTGP and determine whether these changes are related to GTGP. The results show that LP has achieved "win-win" gains of restoring environment and promoting socioeconomic development: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series show a significant greening trend, and soil retention and carbon sequestration services have improved from 2000 to 2015. Simultaneously, grain output from the LP has increased by 56.7%. We also analyzed the effects of afforestation on changes of socio-ecological factors, and find that the changes of NDVI, soil erosion, and carbon sequestration mainly reflect the degree of afforestation rather than climate change, while the correlations between changes of socioeconomic factors and degree of afforestation are insignificant. We conclude that, despite some adverse outcomes such as water yield reduction, GTGP in LP has achieved considerable overall success in environmental factors. However, comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of the social impacts of GTGP is needed, as the impacts are clouded by multiple socioeconomic factors. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizers support global food production and feed over half of the global population. However, more than half of the N fertilizers applied to croplands are not absorbed by crops, but lost to the environment, leading to low N use efficiency (NUE) globally. Identifying and overcoming socioeconomic barriers to achieve an improvement of NUE and a reduction in N loss is thus key for N management and to attain agricultural and environmental sustainability. In this paper, we compiled the global cropland N budgets at a national scale (1961-2018) and developed robust econometric models to explore the relationship between cropland N use with socioeconomic factors. The results demonstrate that economic development and farm size are the key drivers to improve NUE for agricultural and environmental sustainability. In less developed countries, it is difficult for farmers to access chemical fertilizers, leading to croplands receiving too little N input and at a high NUE, but suffering from soil N depletion. As economic development progresses, more fertilizer is produced and applied, but smallholder farming typically leads to over-fertilization and consequently N losses to the environment. Large-scale farming improves NUE, reduces N loss and benefits agricultural production and environmental protection. Also, interactions between farm size and economic development, international trade, crop and livestock systems, and related policies are important causes for changes in the NUE of the whole agricultural system. Overcoming these socioeconomic barriers especially combining large-scale farming could effectively reduce excessive N inputs and sustain agricultural and environmental N management, while maintaining food production, resulting in a triple-win for food security, poverty alleviation, and environmental protection.

AB  - This narrative review paper considers the link between poverty and food security in urban and rural Nigeria, with emphasis on the economic (food availability & accessibility), social (people related factors) and environmental (effective resource use) implications. This study suggests that appropriate governance mechanisms must be put in place while developing strategies and policies to address problems of poverty and food insecurity in Nigeria. Improving infrastructure, mitigating the impact of continuing population growth, and uneven distribution of income, and identifying opportunities for education are important components to consider in developing food security policies and strategies for the Nigerian people.

AB  - Mitigating climate change in soil ecosystems involves complex plant and microbial processes regulating carbon pools and flows. Here, we advocate for the use of soil microbiome interventions to help increase soil carbon stocks and curb greenhouse gas emissions from managed soils. Direct interventions include the introduction of microbial strains, consortia, phage, and soil transplants, whereas indirect interventions include managing soil conditions or additives to modulate community composition or its activities. Approaches to increase soil carbon stocks using microbially catalyzed processes include increasing carbon inputs from plants, promoting soil organic matter (SOM) formation, and reducing SOM turnover and production of diverse greenhouse gases. Marginal or degraded soils may provide the greatest opportunities for enhancing global soil carbon stocks. Among the many knowledge gaps in this field, crucial gaps include the processes influencing the transformation of plant-derived soil carbon inputs into SOM and the identity of the microbes and microbial activities impacting this transformation. As a critical step forward, we encourage broadening the current widespread screening of potentially beneficial soil microorganisms to encompass functions relevant to stimulating soil carbon stocks. Moreover, in developing these interventions, we must consider the potential ecological ramifications and uncertainties, such as incurred by the widespread introduction of homogenous inoculants and consortia, and the need for site-specificity given the extreme variation among soil habitats. Incentivization and implementation at large spatial scales could effectively harness increases in soil carbon stocks, helping to mitigate the impacts of climate change.

AB  - The soil quality concept evolved throughout the 1990s in response to increased global emphasis on sustainable land use and with a holistic focus emphasizing that sustainable soil management requires more than soil erosion control. The concept includes two areas of emphasis-education and assessment-both based soundly on principles of soil science. Soil quality test kits, farmer-based scorecards, visual assessment procedures, fact sheets, and video presentations were developed as educational materials because many people have no basis to recognize, understand or appreciate the complexity of soil resources. Assessment tools for indexing soil quality at various scales were pursued to show the multiple functions (e.g. nutrient and water cycling, filtering and buffering of contaminants, decomposition of crop residues and other organic matter sources, and recycling of essential plant nutrients) that soils provide as the foundation for sustainable land management. Worldwide research and technology transfer efforts have increased awareness that soil resources have both inherent characteristics determined by their basic soil formation factors and dynamic characteristics influenced by human decisions and management practices. Soil quality assessment and education are intended to provide a better understanding and awareness that soil resources are truly living bodies with biological, chemical, and physical properties and processes performing essential ecosystem services.

AB  - This paper analyses spatial dependence and determinants of the New Zealand dairy farmers' adoption of best management practices to protect water quality. A Bayesian spatial durbin probit model is used to survey data collected from farmers in the Waikato region of New Zealand. The results show that farmers located near each other exhibit similar choice behaviour, indicating the importance of farmer interactions in adoption decisions. The results also address that information acquisition is the most important determinant of farmers' adoption of best management practices. Financial problems are considered a significant barrier to adopting best management practices. Overall, the existence of distance decay effect and spatial dependence in farmers' adoption decisions highlights the importance of accounting for spatial effects in farmers' decision-making, which emerges as crucial to the formulation of sustainable agriculture policy.

AB  - The ocean is increasingly used for industry, energy and recreation or protected for conservation, resulting in increasing spatial restrictions for fisheries. Simultaneously, producing seafood with a low climate footprint is becoming increasingly important. Despite this, the effects of spatial restrictions on the emissions of fishing fleets are poorly known. In the Northeast Atlantic, the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU (Brexit) meant that the UK regained autonomy in its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). This suddenly imposed a spatial restriction for several foreign fishing fleets targeting Northeast Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus). Here, we use this natural experiment and open fisheries data to investigate how Brexit affected the performance and emissions of the Norwegian mackerel fishery. As the fleet was excluded from fishing grounds in the UK, the catch per fishing trip almost halved, while the number of trips per vessel doubled. As a result, fuel use intensity (FUI) more than doubled from similar to 0.08 to similar to 0.18 L fuel per kg mackerel. We estimate that this shift required an additional 23 million liters of fuel per year, causing additional fuel costs of similar to<euro>18 million annually and emitting an additional similar to 72,000 tonnes CO2 per year(.) The policy change undid similar to 15 years of improved fuel efficiency in Norwegian pelagic fisheries. These findings provide rare empirical evidence on how spatial restrictions can undermine progress towards decreasing greenhouse gas emissions in fisheries, highlighting the need to monitor and account for emissions in fisheries management and consider these trade-offs in marine spatial management.

AB  - A surging population in Karnataka State, a semi-arid region in India, poses a threat to both food security and livelihood sustainability, necessitating a concentrated effort to bolster agricultural efficiency and achieve United Naton's Sustainable Development Goal 2 (zero hunger). Therefore, in order to address the pressing issue of food scarcity in Karnataka, this study meticulously examined the spatio-temporal variation of agricultural efficiency and irrigation intensity in Karnataka, uncovering its significant dependence of agricultural efficiency on irrigation intensity. Specifically, this study used a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to ascertain significant differences in the means of agricultural efficiency and irrigation intensity during 2004-2005 and 2018-2019. This study showed that the maximum improvement in agricultural efficiency index was recorded in Belgaum (40.24), Gulbarga (24.77), and Yadgir districts (22.92) between 2004-2005 and 2018-2019, which indicated the progressing trend and better scope for agriculture extension. On the contrary, some districts expressed threat (a decline of above 20.00 of agricultural efficiency index) and needed special care for the improvement of agricultural efficiency in four northern districts (Bagalkot, Bidar, Raichur, and Bijapur), three southern districts (Chitradurga, Chikballapur and Hassan), and two southern districts (Koppal and Gadag) in Karnataka. During 2004-2005, irrigation intensity varied from 3.19% to 56.39%, with the lowest irrigation intensity in Kodagu District and the highest irrigation intensity in Shimoga District. During 2018-2019, irrigation intensity changed from 0.77% to 72.77%, with the lowest irrigation intensity in Kodagu District and the highest in Dakshin Kannad District. Moreover, the research scrutinized the complex relationship between agricultural efficiency and irrigation intensity, with the correlation coefficient increased from 0.162 during 2004-2005 to 0.255 during 2018-2019. It implies that in both periods, a low positive correlation existed between these two variables. Over time, several factors (high-yield seeds and chemical fertilizers) other than irrigation intensity gradually became essential for agricultural efficiency. This research offers a wealth of valuable insights for regional planners and policy-makers contending with comparable challenges in various regions of India and other developing countries.

AB  - The uptake of diversified farming systems is constrained by a scarcity of evidence regarding financial costs, benefits, and risks. Here, we evaluate the productivity and projected farm income of an agroforestry system, where apples are integrated with arable crops, by combining primary data with ecosystem service and costbenefit models. Our ecosystem service assessments included: 1) weed and pest associations with arable yields; 2) apple seed set as a proxy for pollination, and; 3) carbon sequestration. Arable yields were up to 11% lower in agroforestry than arable systems, and were significantly negatively associated with weed cover in both systems. Apple yields in agroforestry were similar to typical yields from comparable orchards. Apple seed set was significantly higher in agroforestry than conventional orchards for one of two varieties. Predicted gross mixed income was higher in agroforestry than arable systems in 15 of 18 productivity scenarios over 20 years, which was supported by a case-study. Apple yield and price were the major determinants of gross mixed income. Payments for carbon sequestration were predicted to contribute 47% to 88% of agroforestry establishment costs. This study demonstrates how a diversified farming system can improve farm income, but grant support would reduce the initial negative cash-flow.

AB  - A large number of genetically modified (GM) crops, including both food and non-food crops carrying novel traits have been developed and released for commercial agriculture production. Soybean, maize, canola and cotton for the traits insect resistance and herbicide tolerance are the main crops under commercial cultivation worldwide. In addition, many other GM crops are under development and not yet released commercially. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in its report, the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2017, highlights the severity of food security and malnourishment problem in most of the Asian and developing countries. GM crops could be an option for nutrients enhancement and yield increase in major crops and solve the problem of malnourishment and food security. India has progressed tremendously in GM crops research, evaluation and monitoring in last two decades but regulatory system impeded gravely due to lack of coordination and common stand on GM technology across different governments, ministries and departments. The increasing cultivation of genetically modified crops has raised a wide range of concerns with respect to food safety, environmental effects and socio-economic issues. Here, we discussed the current status of GM crops research, regulatory framework, and challenges involved with transgenic plants research in India.

AB  - Climate change and global warming are already affecting food production, and the impact is predicted to intensify in the future. Previous studies have been based on global data and have provided general information about climate change effects on food production. Regional high-resolution data are, however, needed to evaluate the effect of future scenarios of climate change to support strategic and tactical planning to safeguard food production. Here, we provide results on the future potential distribution range of fungal plant pathogens in the Nordic and Baltic countries. This is done using regional climate model data at 12.5 km horizontal resolution. The temperature dependent infection risk and species richness are calculated using data for 80 plant pathogens. Within the region the studied pathogens will in most cases thrive more and be more abundant in a warmer climate; leading to a longer infection risk season and the introduction of new pathogens. This applies to all emissions scenarios, even though the effects are stronger with high emissions. Our results indicate that plant diseases will increase, and this will negatively affect crop production and food security.

AB  - North China Plain is a main grain producing area in China. It is very important for China to find a simple and low carbon method for grain production. To better understand the potential for increasing grain yield and carbon absorption, treatment effects of straw mulching on grain yield, carbon absorption in crop growth period, and soil CO2 emission characteristics in 2012-2014 summer maize growing seasons were quantified. The experiment involved summer maize with two straw mulching rates, i.e., 0 and 0.6 kg m(-2). The result showed that soil respiration rate in straw mulching (M) was significantly lower than that in non-mulching (N). The carbon absorption and grain yield in M was significantly higher than that in N. In the three growing seasons, ear number, kernels per row, 1000-kernel weight, and grain yield in M were higher than that in N by 4.07%, 4.03%, 10.93%, and 20.54%, respectively. The result indicates that straw mulching has the effect of yield increasing and soil carbon sequestration in summer maize crop in North China.

AB  - Regarding environmental challenges, crop diversification provides some of the answers. Nevertheless, whatever the strengths, some weak points come up: low economical interest, knowledge of technical practices, lack of chain value and industry organization providing outlets and value. The authors present the results of a case study conducted in France (Pays de la Loire). Among the determining criteria identified in the study, which can turn into an incentive or disincentive factor, we can list: (1) turn-around time and location of the diversification crop inside the rotation, (2) environmental constraints (soil quality, soils sensibility to drought), (3) the work required and complexity of the cultural practices, (5) the potential synergy with stockbreeding and (6) technical support. If economic performance of those crops appears to be often considered too low, the study underlines how the lack of knowledge about diversification encourages farmers-respondents to adopt a "wait and see" attitude.

AB  - With rapid socioeconomic and population growth, high-quality arable land resources are decreasing daily, especially in arid areas, which makes arable land reserve resources an important way to supplement arable land. How to accurately evaluate cultivated land reserve resources is of great significance to socioeconomic development and sustainable land use in arid areas. Therefore, this study selected Hangjin Banner as a typical area and calculated the regional maximum available irrigation water based on the principle of regional water balance. Then, the "irrigation area check algorithm" was used to evaluate the amount of cultivated land reserve resources, and policy recommendations were proposed for the development and utilization of cultivated land resources. The results showed that Hangjin Banner had no cultivated land reserve resources under the current irrigation method and had cultivated land reserve resources under the efficient water-saving irrigation method, but only in the southern zone during normal and partially abundant water years. Therefore, we believe that arid areas should adhere to the "set land by water" principle, the allocation of water resources should be optimized, and cultivated land resources with high quality should be utilized based on the actual regional conditions.

AB  - Iron (Fe) bioavailability to plants is reduced in saline soils; therefore, plants growing in arid soils face two major challenges for poor crop productivity: high salinity and Fe deficiency. Siderophore-producing plant growthpromoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) could be a promising alternative to chemical fertilizers that could tackle salt stress and Fe limitation in saline soils concurrently. Here, four salt-tolerant PGPR, isolated from the root area of salt-prone rice fields of Bangladesh were studied to evaluate their siderophore-producing ability. Bacillus aryabhattai MS3 exhibited the highest production, estimated at 60% and 43% under non-saline and saline (200mM NaCl) conditions respectively. The expression of the entD gene, which is involved in the biosynthesis of siderophore was evidenced irrespective of saline states. Therefore, consideration of such salt-tolerant, siderophoreproducing PGPR for producing biofertilizer could be an eco-friendly innovation for climate-smart agriculture in salinized soils with limited iron availability.

AB  - Food is a source of sustenance, a cause for celebration, an inducement to temptation, a vehicle for power, an indicator of well-being, a catalyst for change and, above all, a life good. Along with other life goods such as potable water, clean air, adequate shelter and protective clothing, food is something we cannot live without. The global corporate food system, however, allows 800 million to go hungry, while an even larger number of people grow obese. Based in money-values, this food system promotes accumulation first and foremost, enriching a few while creating economic, social and environmental externalities that are destroying local economies, devastating individuals, families and communities and degrading the planet. What would a food system look like that was based in life-values, centred on the commons and anchored by social justice? This paper will focus on the creation of sustainable food systems, beginning with the crises of the global corporate food system and then moving to the heart of sustainable food systems-the civil commons.

AB  - Recently there has been more focus on food in general and local food in particular. But what is local food? And what are the perceptions of this concept according to theory and to providers and consumers of local food? This article first summarises and compares three different theoretical perspectives on local food, namely experience economy, local food systems and what is termed pro-industrialism. These have differing and sometimes opposite conceptualisations and aims for the concept of local food. Using the perspective of experience economy as theoretical background, the concept of local food as expressed by a group of Danish providers and consumers is empirically investigated through interviews, observation and surveys. From this, qualitative and quantitative data are generated, the analysis of which shows how varied perceptions of local food are. The elements of which the perceptions consist are identified and then categorised according to whether they pertain to the food product itself or the production methods and facilities and whether they describe physical or social properties of local food. From this a model with four categories is developed. It is found that properties of the product are more frequently mentioned than properties of the production process. Providers emphasise social properties of the product more often than consumers, and consumers emphasise physical properties of the product more often than providers. Inversely, providers emphasise physical properties of production more than consumers, who emphasise social properties of production more than providers. Experience marketing and events may create diffusion of a local food concept, but only when communication is massive and long-lasting. So far this has not been the case, hence there is no agreement in either theory or among the providers and consumers studied on what local food is. However, this may change in time.

AB  - An atmospheric water irrigation system based on super moisture absorbent gels (SMAG) is developed for sustainable agriculture technology. The SMAG-soil can harvest water from the air and provide water to the plants upon solar heating regardless of the local accessibility to liquid water resources. As a benefit of this solar-powered atmospheric water irrigation system, agriculture can become geographically and hydrologically independent. Thus, crop planting in underdeveloped and drought areas can be liberated from the long-distance water and power supplies.

AB  - Brazil is a major sugarcane producer and its production more than doubled over the last decades to meet global bioenergy demands for reducing crude oil dependency and mitigating climate change. Nevertheless, the adverse effects of this growth on jeopardizing the sustainability of sugarcane production are not known, especially when environmental impacts of agricultural inputs and production processes are not judiciously managed. This article is a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-knowledge and the main advances made thus far in the sugarcane sector. Here, we review the major environmental impacts of rapidly expanding sugarcane plantation on the land use change and its competition with food production, as well as those associated with sugarcane cultivation in Brazil. Our main finding are that sugarcane plantation did not contribute to direct deforestation, and its expansion on degraded pastures with the attendant increased yields of food crops and livestock intensification decreased land competition between food and sugarcane. Non-burning sugarcane harvesting is a win-win strategy because of its benefits involving agronomic and environmental aspects, but soil compaction is among the main issues in sugarcane cropping systems. Sugarcane is highly efficient in terms of nitrogen use efficiency, which is an important factor for its high energy balance. But, special attention should be given regarding emissions of nitrous oxide when straw mulching is combined with application of nitrogen fertilizer and vinasse. Recent advances in the sugarcane sector also show significant reductions in water consumption, making sugarcane ethanol one of the most favorable options in terms of water footprint. Growing realization of a vast potential indicates the need to further enhance the environmental benefits of sugarcane ethanol by optimizing the agricultural production chain. Based on this improved knowledge, the adoption of best management practices is among researchable priorities that can be developed to consolidate the large potential of sugarcane production towards greater sustainability.

AB  - There has been much interest in the failures of the past and the environmental disasters that ensued because of poor land management practices. I argue that the successes of the past are of equal importance, and this is increasingly recognized as early agricultural techniques are rediscovered and reinstated. Some of these systems are not only more sustainable than modern technologies, but more resilient in the face of environmental extremes. Ancient engineering and agricultural methods are often more appropriate for developing countries than modern technologies based on fossil fuel and imported materials. As global warming and desertification increase, it is crucial that we learn how to deal with marginal environments in ways that are sustainable and accessible to people in developing countries. Sustainable agriculture can also benefit the developed world by increasing yields, promoting biodiversity and supporting the rural economy.

AB  - Aboriginal people in Canada experience disproportionately high rates of diet-related illnesses, such as obesity and diabetes. Food insecurity has been identified as a contributing factor to these illnesses along with a loss of traditional lifestyle. Current food systems within northern subarctic and arctic regions of Canada rely heavily on imported foods that are expensive (when available), and are environmentally unsustainable. A warming subarctic and arctic climate present challenges, but also offers the opportunity for local agricultural production that can increase food security and promote a more sustainable food system. In this study the feasibility of sustainably growing potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) utilizing agroforestry practices to enhance food security in remote subarctic communities is explored through a case study in Fort Albany First Nation in northern Ontario, Canada. Potato crops were grown over a two-year period and rotated into plots that had been planted with green bush beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Results showed that potatoes and bush beans could be grown successfully in the subarctic without the use of greenhouses with yields comparable to more conventional high-input agricultural methods. In subarctic Canada, sustainable local food production can help to promote social capital, healthier lifestyles, and food security.

AB  - Sustainable consumption is a complex, multifaceted area requiring a partnership approach across the food chain to reduce the environmental impacts of the food we choose to consume. Communicating the environmental benefits of products and the importance of wasting less food, supporting honest environmental labelling and defining methodologies for sustainable food will help inform these choices. Government initiatives to support sustainable fish species consumption, reconnect people with food and work towards a zero-waste economy will help to tackle environmental and climate change impacts. The Government is committed to addressing global challenges identified by Foresight to meet increasing food demand with less environmental impact. Evidence to underpin sustainable food policy requires a joined-up approach across funders, industry and the third sector to strengthen research activity and maximise impact. The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs' research and development targets the whole food chain from production to consumption. Activity addresses sustainability and resource efficiency; environmental impacts; supply chain and consumer drivers, behaviours and practice; explores synergies, trade-offs and tensions; and ways to promote availability and take up of sustainable healthy food.

AB  - Agricultural systems in the EU have become more vulnerable and less sustainable due to an overreliance on herbicides and the tremendous increase in herbicide-resistant weeds. The EU Green Deal aims to reduce the use and risk of chemical pesticides by 50% by 2030, although it is still undefined whether a reduction in herbicide use could be feasible in different farming systems and situations. This review aims to provide a holistic framework for sustainable crop and weed management to reduce the herbicide input and ensure crop protection. Current and future dilemmas and policies that need to be handled to ensure the agroecological transition of the EU's agricultural systems are also discussed. The integration of non-chemical alternatives for integrated weed management is feasible and includes novel cultivation techniques (e.g., intercropping, false seedbed, reduced tillage, crop rotation and diversification, adjustments on sowing densities and dates), non-chemical tools (e.g., flaming, seed coating, beneficial microorganisms, mechanical weeding, biocontrol agents and natural herbicides), competitive plant material (hybrids and cultivars, cover crops, service crops), and new technologies and precision agriculture tools (e.g., Decision Support Systems, robots, remote sensing, UAVs, omics and nanotechnology). A special focus should be appointed to agroecology and biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Food is a vital component of everyday life, however current consumption and production patterns pose a threat to the environment and the food security of future generations. Thus, with environmental burdens becoming more apparent and rising societal awareness, it is time to reconsider dietary choices and the food system behind it. This paper presents a novel application of a network design problem, addressing sustainability issues in the context of the global food system. Taking into account several echelons and interlinkages between different food supply chains, the paper broadens the scope of the considered network and incorporates sourcing, processing and transportation decisions within a common framework. While minimising different environmental and economic objectives, the model aims to maintain a sufficient dietary intake level. Consumption decisions are incorporated in the model through different types of consumer demands. The problem is formulated based on linear programming and further analysis is carried out by applying the E-constraint method and compromise programming. Investigating alternative production and consumption scenarios as well as trade-offs between the conflicting objectives, the study is illustrated based on a nutritional case study and underpinned by real-life LCA data. The findings of this research are manifold, highlighting the importance of considering consumption and production decisions in an integrated and global setting. Moreover, the choice of sustainability indicator plays a crucial role given the often conflicting nature of different sustainability aspects. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wheat agroecosystems provide one of the most important crops worldwide yet are often threatened by land degradation and climate change, making it vital to find practices that sustain soil health. Organic amendments can regenerate degraded soils, provide plant-available nutrients, and sequester carbon (C), and have long-lasting impacts in semiarid regions. This project evaluated the legacy of compost (0-50 Mg ha(-1)) in an organic winter wheat-fallow rotation by comparing soil health and plant growth either 1-2 or 5-6 years after compost application, with or without cover crops. We assessed soil chemistry, structure, labile organic matter pools, microbial activity (by extracellular enzymes), and microbial community composition (by phospholipid fatty acids). We aimed to understand how compost application and cover cropping contribute to long-term soil health and C storage in semiarid regions, and how these practices impact soil microbiology. Compost resulted in sustained increases in organic matter pools, but only marginally benefitted plant growth and soil structure. Compost did not impact microbial community composition or activity, possibly because cold and dry conditions inhibited microbial functioning and compost decomposition. Cover crops did not impact soil organic matter or microbiology. Overall, we found that compost can contribute to long-term soil C storage in semiarid degraded soils such as these, despite having no measurable impacts on soil microbial biomass or activity.

AB  - Sustainable land management practices are a strategic tool for addressing land degradation processes that threaten agroecosystem services supply. Currently, carbon credit schemes are important promoters of the adoption of such practices, yet their effectiveness on providing services other than carbon sequestration is not frequently assessed. Particularly, vegetation cover may not only be a mediator of CO2 fixation, but also act as protection against soil erosion and prevent water quality deterioration. The overarching aim was to develop generalizable methods to assess the effectiveness of sustainable land management practices for maintaining agroecosystem integrity. To achieve this, we assessed the effect of soil carbon sequestration practices on remotely sensed groundcover levels and its stability, and on its response to short-term antecedent accumulated rainfall. These methods were tested in the Cowra Trough, an agricultural region of semi-arid New South Wales, Australia. Time series statistics (mean and standard deviation) and non-parametric tests were used to analyse temporal change in remotely sensed groundcover on paddocks undergoing different land management change intensities. This was complemented with a regional scale analysis of the effect of land use to contextualize paddock-scale results. Moreover, sequential linear regressions of remotely sensed vegetation cover response to antecedent rainfall through a moving temporal window were employed to assess trends in this relationship. A significant effect of land management change was demonstrated: over 90% of the sites implementing sustainable practices had increased and more stable ground cover levels, and the same number (though not the same sites) decreased their ground cover dependence on rainfall. The size of the effect was not related to the intensity of management change implemented for soil carbon sequestration. Land use type proved to be an important spatiotemporal predictor of ground cover and its stability at the Cowra Trough scale with cropping performing worse than grazing systems. Notably, the implementation of carbon farming practices was found to have a more prevalent positive impact on ground cover than on soil carbon contents, suggesting that such practices may provide cobenefits even when no carbon sequestration occurred. This study advances the possibility of monitoring agroecosystem multifunctionality and the development of integrative 'payment for ecosystem services' schemes.

AB  - The social, political and economical driving forces behind land use change in Central and Eastern European countries, such as land privatisation and EU-membership are well documented. However, there are few studies that examine the possible role of environmental characteristics such as soil quality in land use change, and most of these studies keep a marginal importance of the environmental factors on the land use change. The objective of this study is to investigate the regional scale relationship between soil quality and land use change before (1981-1990), during (1990-2000), and after (2000-2006) the land privatisation in Hungary. The Lake Balaton catchment was selected as a study area for such analysis because of its rapidly changing historic landscapes which are well-documented in terms of data availability. Historic land use data were obtained from military topographic maps (1981), CORINE land cover maps (1990, 2000) and satellite images (2006) at 1:100,000 scale. The National Soil Quality Evaluation System (NSES) is used for representing soil quality by 'soil quality scores' that lump various soil parameters such as organic matter content, soil texture and erosion level, derived from regional soil mapping. GIS methods were used to analyse, verify and evaluate soil quality and it is connection with the agricultural land use change. Results of this study show that soil quality has a relevant role in shaping rural landscape patterns in Hungary. It is demonstrated that the soil quality acts as a location factor in the case of arable land use change between 1981-1990. In this period, arable lands have been moved to areas where the best soils were found. Models that are used to predict future land use changes should therefore take into account the change patterns (arable land migration) described in this paper. Results also show that spatial land use change can be linked to the pattern of the complex NSES soil quality scoring systems.

AB  - Due to the emphasis on sustainable development and environmental protection, searching for new technologies in the production of fruit and vegetables is essential. Organic farming using natural preparations is aimed to produce healthy food, rich in nutrients that is unmodified and uncontaminated. Pepper fruit is characterized by its valuable chemical composition and dietary and taste values. The available information on the influence of natural preparations on pepper fruit is insufficient. Therefore, this study was aimed at evaluating the influence of the natural preparations and plant extracts, such as organic fertilizer Bio-algeen S90, growth and development stimulator Natural Crop (R) SL, nettle extract (fertilizer with a killing and nutritional effect) on the chemical composition, structure (image texture), and sensory quality of Devito F1 and Sprinter F1 pepper fruit in organic greenhouse cultivation under the conditions for organic farming. The combination of measurements of chemical properties, flesh image features, and sensory analysis for assessing the quality of pepper treated with these preparations is a great novelty of this study. The obtained results showed that the use of Bio-algeen S90 and Natural Crop (R) SL had an impact on the increase in the total yield compared to the control samples. Furthermore, the application of Bio-algeen S90 and Natural Crop (R) SL increased the content of nutrients and health-promoting compounds, such as total sugars, L-ascorbic acid, total polyphenols, and carotenoids for both pepper cultivars Devito F1 and Sprinter F1. The applied natural preparations had an impact on the flesh structure, which was greater for pepper Devito F1. The selected image textures allowed for distinguishing pepper slices in terms of natural preparations with higher accuracies for Devito F1 than Sprinter F1. However, in the case of both cultivars, the samples treated with NaturalCrop (R) SL were the most different from the control. Natural preparations were not affecting significantly the sensory attributes of pepper fruit. All treated samples were characterized by high sensory quality.

AB  - Neglected and underutilized food crops (NUFCs) have high nutritional value, but their role in achieving nutrition security is not adequately understood, and they do not feature in food and nutrition policies and programs of the countries of the Hindu-Kush Himalayan (HKH) region. Drawing examples from Pakistan and Nepal, this study investigates the importance of NUFCs in achieving nutrition security in the mountains and identifies key underlying reasons for the decline in their cultivation and use. The study found that the prevalence of malnutrition is significantly higher in the mountains than nationally in both Pakistan and Nepal and identifies the decline in the cultivation and use of micronutrient-rich NUFCs as one of the key reasons for this. The deterioration of local food systems, changing food habits, lack of knowledge about the cultivation, use and nutritional value of NUFCs and lack of attention to NUFCs in programs and policies are the key reasons for the abandoning of NUFCs by mountain communities. There is an urgent need to mainstream these crops into national programs and policies and to integrate them into local food systems. This will not only improve the nutrition security of mountain areas, but also biodiversity and local mountain economies.

AB  - Seasonality was shown to have an effect on food availability and accessibility, increasing the risk of food insecurity and causing poor diet quality and malnutrition. Therefore, this study aimed to determine seasonal effects on household food security status, diet quality, and nutritional status of urban poor adolescents in Malaysia. A cohort study was conducted among 164 adolescents aged 10-17 from 12 People Housing Programme in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia during the Northeast (November 2021 till March 2022) and Southwest (June 2022 till September 2022) monsoon. Household food security status was measured using the 18-item USDA Household Food Security Survey Module. Dietary intake was determined using a two-days 24-h dietary recall and translated into Standardized Malaysian Healthy Eating Index (S-MHEI). Anthropometric and haemoglobin level measurements were performed to determine nutritional status. Seasonality was found to have a significant effect on overall diet quality (p = 0.021), food groups such as fish (p < 0.001), meat/poultry/eggs (p = 0.003), and legumes/nuts (p < 0.001), and fat nutrient (p = 0.037) as well as anaemia status (p = 0.020) after controlling the confounders. Although food security did not vary with seasons, seasonality affected the consumption of certain food groups as well as anaemia status for urban poor adolescents. Seasonally sensitive nutrition initiatives should be developed to ensure diet adherence to recommendations, ultimately enhancing the diet quality of urban poor adolescents.

AB  - Biochar addition to soils has been proposed as a means to increase soil fertility and carbon sequestration. However, its effect on soil nitrogen (N) cycling and N availability is poorly understood. To gain better insight into the temporal variability of the impact of biochar on gross soil N dynamics, two N-15 tracing experiments, in combination with numerical data analysis, were conducted with soil from a biochar field trial, 1day and 1year after application of a woody biochar type. The results showed accelerated soil N cycling immediately following biochar addition, with increased gross N mineralization (+34%), nitrification (+13%) and ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-) immobilization rates (+4500% and +511%, respectively). One year after biochar application, the biochar acted as an inert substance with respect to N cycling. In the short term, biochar's labile C fraction and a pH increase can explain stimulated microbial activity, while in the longer term, when the labile C fraction has been mineralized and the pH effect has faded, the accelerating effect of biochar on N cycling ceases. In conclusion, biochar accelerates soil N transformations in the short-term through stimulating soil microbial activity, thereby increasing N bio-availability. This effect is, however, temporary.

AB  - An agroecological transition can enhance resilience by several means, e.g., managing ecological relationships through agroecosystems, enhancing farmers' knowledge of natural resources, recycling those resources, maintaining biodiversity, and thus, flexibly adapting to environmental stresses. However, the hegemonic agri-food system has been continuing its capitalist transition, thereby undermining agroecological methods and deterritorialising social bonds. Facing this pervasive threat, an agroecological transition needs a greater convergence between agroecological production and a solidarity economy (economia solidaria or EcoSol in Latin America). Their convergence can be called EcoSol-agroecology, based on short food supply chains (called circuitos cortos there). These efforts develop territorial markets, generate more stable livelihoods, and thus keep producers on the land. In our study, each research team collaborated with an EcoSol-agroecology network to develop Participatory Action Research methods. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted their circuitos cortos, stimulating creative adaptations or alternatives, alongside demands for policy support measures. These networks have regionally territorialised local initiatives, while also confronting obstacles from the hegemonic system. Although socioecological resilience often means a system's capacity to bounce back, here it has meant bouncing forwards through new opportunities for solidaristic livelihoods and bonds. EcoSol-agroecology networks, agri-extensionists, and researchers have jointly developed such counter-hegemonic strategies, as illustrated by the case studies here.

AB  - Over the last few decades, cities have taken on an active role in the formulation of food policies in line with the transition toward local, sustainable food systems. These policies have been materialized through the formulation of systemic, holistic urban food strategies. By setting up spatial, relational and organizational proximity circuits, they aim to reconnect the places involved in the production and consumption of food within the territory. The objective is to do so by interaction between the networks of actors on the different geographical scales. This article analyzes the food policies of six Spanish cities that signed the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact. Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia, Vitoria, Valladolid and Zaragoza have fulfilled their promise by formulating food strategies that set out their commitment to the construction of new, urban food systems that reconsider, from a territorial perspective, the relationship between the city and food. Using a conceptual framework that spans two well-known theoretical systems (the local territorial systems (LoTS) and the sustainable food networks (SFN)); a systematic review of the documents generated in the formulation of the urban food policies is carried out. The territorial capital linked to food is examined; the systems of actors that make up the food strategies are identified; the models of governance that the said strategies deploy and their capacity for self-organization are typified; and the potential of the public agendas for encouraging the construction of localized alternatives and the territorial sustainability of the urban food systems are evaluated. The results suggest that the Spanish urban food strategies, although conceptually inspired by the principles of the Milan Pact, are still far from possessing similarly transformative capacities. Such capacities are directly linked to the characteristics of the place: the existence of relational goods connected to food, the attributes of the territorial food capital, the density of the social capital, and the culture of the territorial planning. Beyond the generic references to the commitment to food, it is the context that determines its personality and reach, the solidity of the food governance, and the political sustainability of the processes that one wishes to set up.

AB  - This paper focuses on contract design to improve the incentive structure of current coordination mechanisms related to sustainable land use management in the Ethiopian highlands. The main objective is to assess whether, and if so under which terms and conditions, rural households are willing to enter into contractual agreements to invest in soil conservation measures on their land. Participation constraints are tested under different soil erosion and institutional-economic conditions in a choice experiment targeting 750 rural households. We show that contracts provided by local government peasant associations offering additional credit, land use security and extension services could be an effective means to increase the share of farmers implementing soil conservation measures. However, trust in contract terms and conditions appears to play an important role. Farmers living in the most erosion prone areas are most likely to participate, while farmers taking soil conservation measures already are less likely to enter into a contractual agreement with the local government. Farmers not taking soil conservation measures will only do so if the contract price is lower than or equal to the income losses suffered from soil erosion. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sustainable consumption is an urgent issue regarding the rising global environmental pressures. Consequently, sustainable consumption is an important matter for more and more consumers in Germany. But the perception that sustainable consumer goods incur additional costs is a widely mentioned barrier. We have developed a statistical method based on the Laspeyres price index and the product descriptions of the Purchasing Power Parities (PPP) in order to examine the additional costs of organic food products compared to conventional food products. These costs depend on the households' expenditure structure, so called weighting scheme. Based on Engel's law, we predict a negative correlation between net equivalent income and the additional costs for organic food products. We verify and quantify this relationship by using income-related weighting schemes. The results show that organic food products are about 80 % more expensive than conventional food products. Furthermore, we find that households cannot afford to purchase solely organic food products without getting into debt when their net equivalent income is below median.

AB  - Sustainable farming practices (SFPs) are often touted as vehicles for improving crop productivity and the livelihoods of many rural households. However, SFP's adoption rates remain persistently low, especially among smallholder farmers in many rural parts of developing countries. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the adoption of SFPs amongst smallholder crop farmers in Mbombela, South Africa. A simple random sampling procedure was employed to collect data from 294 farmers who were solely specializing in crop production. The data were collected using a structured questionnaire, and the analysis was performed with descriptive statistics. A multivariate probit model was adopted to determine the socio-economic determinants of adopting SFPs. The findings of this study confirm that SFPs are essential for addressing the abiotic and biophysical challenges that impede crop productivity, as farmers view these practices as highly beneficial in their farming activities. Also, the results reveal that crop rotation was the most adopted practice, whereas intercropping and conservation tillage were the least adopted practices in the surveyed area. Furthermore, the study showed that "gender, years of education, off-farm income, annual income, marital status, and satisfaction with extension services" were significant socio-economic attributes that do indeed influence the adoption of SFPs by smallholder crop farmers in the surveyed area. These findings underscore the need for the Ministry of Agriculture and rural development stakeholders to address issues relating to economic incentives, improve farmers' perception of SFPs, provide financial literacy and support programs, and intensify efforts to promote underutilized practices.

AB  - Increasingly, food security interventions in developing economies are adapting value chain approaches to facilitate the integration of smallholders into high margin value chains. In Kenya, the resurgence of African Indigenous Vegetables due to their medicinal value and rich micronutrients is a case in point. The vegetables are cultivated by smallholders, and the supply has not matched the demand in the high margin markets among urban consumers. Access to such high margin markets necessitates that smallholders gain entry or upgrade into the networks of those buyers who possess considerable control of these value chains. There is limited value chain scholarship on chain governance and its implication for smallholder participation in Kenya. This study investigated how value chain governance influences farmer participation in vegetable markets and food security in Kenya. This study employed exploratory case study design to provide chain architecture, isolate primary actors, their roles, relations, constraints and opportunities for upgrading by smallholders. A mixed method approach involving a multi-stage sampling technique of 339 respondents was employed to bring to the surface insights on chain architecture, market margins and governance structures and their implications as regards upgrading trajectories for small-scale farmers in Kenya. Thematic analysis was used for data analysis. Spot market relations were found to dominate traditional value chains in rural areas while peri-urban areas exhibited both traditional and coordinated value chains. The value chains are characterised by very weak linkages between upstream actors and downstream partners, where wholesalers and supermarkets play the role of leading firms in traditional and coordinated value chains, respectively. The study recommends the inclusion of famers in market management committees and the establishment of binding contractual arrangements with supermarkets.

AB  - Background University students may experience a high prevalence of food insecurity. The impacts of food insecurity on dietary intake and meal patterns of students have not been fully researched. Objective This systematic review aimed to examine the association between food insecurity and dietary outcomes among university students. Methods Nine electronic databases and gray literature were searched from their inception to July 2020. Studies that reported dietary outcomes in both food-secure and-insecure students or the association between food insecurity and dietary outcomes among current students in tertiary education settings in any country were included. All study designs were eligible for inclusion, except qualitative studies. Two reviewers completed the screening, data extraction, and quality assessment independently. Study quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute appraisal tools. Results Sixteen studies were included in the final qualitative synthesis of this review. Most studies were cross-sectional designs and of fair quality. The prevalence of food insecurity among university students ranged from 21% to 82% across studies. Lower intakes of healthy foods (eg, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains) and higher intakes of unhealthy foods (eg, fast foods, added sugars, and sugar-sweetened beverages) were observed in food-insecure students, and studies with the most representative samples of the student body found these trends. Some food-insecure students consumed breakfast and evening meals less frequently than food-secure students but the evidence was limited. Validated food security and dietary assessment tools were inconsistently used to assess diet quality among students with differing food security status. The heterogeneity of student sampling and data collection may contribute to inconsistent findings. Conclusion Poorer dietary outcomes were found in university students with food insecurity compared with food-secure students, but statistical significance was only observed in a small number of studies. Future longitudinal studies using food security and dietary assessment tools validated in this population are recommended to confirm the observed associations between food insecurity and diet quality among university students.

AB  - The agriculture sector contributes significantly to global carbon emissions from diverse sources such as product and machinery manufacture, transport of materials and direct and indirect soil greenhouse gas emissions. In this article, we use farm survey data from the east of Scotland combined with published estimates of emissions for individual farm operations to quantify the relative contribution of a range of farming operations and determine the carbon footprint of different crops (e.g. legumes, winter and spring cereals, oilseed rape, potato) and farming practices (conventional, integrated and organic). Over all crops and farm types, 75% of the total emissions result from nitrogen fertilizer use (both organic and inorganic) - from production, application, and direct nitrous oxide emissions from the soil resulting from application. Once nitrogen is accounted for, there are no major differences-between organic, integrated or conventional farming practices. These data highlight opportunities or carbon mitigation and will be of value for inclusion in full life cycle analyses of arable production systems and in calculations of greenhouse gas balance associated with land-use change.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic and locust swarm outbreaks pose a significant threat to global food systems, causing severe disruptions in both local and international food supplies from farm to fork. The main objective of this study is to understand and identify the disruptions during the crises and create a map of how resilience can be established to recover and sustain the food supply chain (FSC) functions as well as food security. The detrimental impacts of the compound crises on the FSC are explored and the effects of the affected areas are estimated under optimistic and pessimistic scenarios. As a response to the disruption caused by the crisis in FSCs, reactive and proactive solutions are proposed to develop resilience at the food sector level. In the short term, the reactive solutions, consisting of smoothing the food demand, supply and delivery, and food production and processing, can be borrowed. In the long term, the proactive solutions can be conducted by developing multi-level short intertwined FSCs. Our comprehensive investigation of the resilience elements in diverse operations and potential strategies should contribute to the improvement of FSC resilience in the face of ongoing and growing threats.

AB  - Food supply chains are essential for urban sustainability. To reflect on the state of knowledge on urban food flows in urban metabolism research, and the actual and potential role of urban metabolism studies to tackle food sustainability in cities, we systematically review scientific research on food from an urban metabolism perspective and apply statistical and thematic analyses. The analysis of 89 studies provides insights as to the relation between food supply and (environmental and social dimensions of) urban sustainability. First, food is an important contributor to urban environmental impacts, if a consumption-based approach is adopted. Secondly, the social impacts of urban food supply remain scarcely studied in urban metabolism research, but emerging results on public health, malnutrition, and food waste appear promising. In parallel, we find that the findings of the studies fail to engage with debates present in the broader literature, such as that of food justice. Our analysis shows that most studies focus on large cities in high-income, data-rich countries. This limits our understanding of global urban food supply. Existing studies use innovative mixed-methods to produce robust accounts of urban food flows in data-scarce contexts; expanding these accounts is necessary to get a better understanding of how urban food supply and its diverse impacts in terms of environmental and social sustainability may vary across cities, a necessary step for the urban metabolism literature to contribute to current debates around food sustainability and justice.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a major increase in the commercialization of horticultural crops in response to population increase. However, several important factors associated with pre- and post-harvest conditions, including drought stress, pathogen infection, water loss and climate change are limiting the commercialization potential of many horticultural crops, thereby compromising agricultural sustainability. The cuticle, which is composed of cutin and waxes, provides a critical structural barrier between a plant parts and its environment. Cuticle biosynthesis is influenced by many factors during plant development and contributes to the pre- and post-harvest quality of many horticultural crops. However, many aspects of the structure-function relationships of many aspects of the plant cuticle are not well understood. Studies focusing on cuticles are increasingly important due to the major challenges of crop production, such as diseases and abiotic stresses. In this review, we focus on the cuticle as a key factor in the quality of horticultural crops and provide an overview of the recent research and conclusions in the field.

AB  - Carbon sequestration by agricultural soils has been widely promoted as a means of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. In many regions agricultural fields are just one component of a complex landscape matrix and understanding the interactions between agricultural fields and other landscape components such as wetlands is crucial for comprehensive, whole-landscape accounting of soil organic carbon (SOC) change. Our objective was to assess the effects of management and erosional history on SOC storage in wetlands of a typical hummocky agricultural landscape in southern Saskatchewan. Wetlands were classed into three land management groups: native wetlands (i.e., within a native landscape), and uncultivated and cultivated wetlands within an agricultural landscape. Detailed topographic surveys were used to develop a digital elevation model of the sites and landform segmentation algorithms were used to delineate the topographic data into landform elements. SOC density to 45 cm, was assessed at seven uncultivated wetlands, seven cultivated wetlands, and twelve native wetlands. Mean SOC density decreased from 175.1 mg ha(-1) to 30 cm (equivalent mass depth) for the native wetlands to 168.6 mg ha(-1) for the uncultivated wetlands and 87.2 mg ha(-1) for the cultivated wetlands in the agricultural field. The SOC density of sediment depositional fans in the uncultivated wetlands is high but the total SOC stored in the fans is low due to their small area. The uncultivated wetlands occupy only 11% of the site but account for approximately 23% of SOC stores. Re-establishing permanent vegetation in the cultivated wetlands could provide maximum C sequestration with minimum energy inputs and a minimum loss of productive acreage but the overall consequences for the gas emissions would have to be carefully assessed.

AB  - The effects of site preparation practices (drainage, mounding and fertilization) on the fluxes from the soil surface of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were studied on an organic-rich peaty gley soil at Harwood Forest, north-east England. Drained plots had significantly higher CO2 fluxes but significantly lower CH4 fluxes compared with undrained plots, while N2O emissions were not affected by drainage. Mounding caused significantly higher CH4 emissions, while it significantly reduced N2O emissions. Fertilization caused significant increases in emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O. In terms of overall greenhouse warming potential, drainage and fertilization increased CO2-equivalent emissions by similar to 18-29 and 7-23 per cent, respectively, while mounding reduced CO2-equivalent emissions by similar to 8 per cent in year 1, but had no effect on emissions in year 2 of study. Soil temperature was the main environmental variable controlling CO2 emissions, while CH4 was controlled primarily by water table depth. Nitrous oxide emissions responded to changes in soil temperature and water table depth. In the short term, drainage and fertilization contributed to accelerating greenhouse gas emissions significantly, although their long-term effects are likely moderated by accelerating carbon accumulation in the tree biomass. Long-term studies are required to assess the cumulative impacts of site preparation practices during the whole rotation cycle.

Iran is a country in the water-scarce region of the Middle East and a great part of it is arid and semi-arid areas. This study aimed to investigate the effect of water crisis on food production of Iran. Results showed that Iran is suffering from a high water stress situation. The agriculture sector of Iran is the major source for feeding its fast growing population and this section has put a severe pressure on groundwater resources in order to meet food demand of the country. Since then Iran has used a great part of its hydrologic renewable water resources and due to which it could be estimated that the withdrawals reached to non-renewable part of groundwater. Thus, Iran's agriculture would face a great challenge of water shortage in near future and the food security of the country will be threatened. Using new irrigation methods and technology and revision of crop pattern in agriculture are suggested in order to confront the threat of water crisis to the food security of Iran.

AB  - The intricacy associated with policy design for environmental sustainability has necessitated a reconsideration of the output and environmental degradation relationship. Like many economies across the globe, the sector contributions to environmental woe are likely contingent on the respective economic performance of the sectors. From this perspective, this study examines the environmental effects of the contributions of agriculture value-added, merchandize value-added, export value-added, and share value-added over the period 1991-2019. By employing a combination of econometric techniques, the result revealed that agriculture value-added and export value-added mitigate environmental hazards, while a 1% increase in total energy utilization, merchandize value-added, and share value-added induce carbon emission by about 0.6%, 0.02%, and 0.001%. Moreover, the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis is validated for agriculture value-added and carbon emission nexus. However, there is a significant U-shaped relationship between carbon emission and economic contributions from the merchandize value-added, export value-added, and share value-added, thus suggesting that the EKC hypothesis is not valid. The study suggests that Turkey's agricultural sector is possibly living to the expectation of adopting and incorporating environmental sustainability practices. On the other hand, sustainable environmental policies related to other sectors of the economy are proffered in consonance with the indicated result from the study.

AB  - Moldova faces substantial agri- food security challenges, including the availability, accessibility, and affordability of safe, nutritious food for its population. With high poverty rates and a large rural population relying on agriculture, Moldova's agricultural sector has small landholdings, low productivity, and insufficient investment in modern technologies. Climate change and extreme weather events have led to declines in agricultural production and increased dependence on imports for food needs. The recent COVID-19 pandemic and regional conflict in Ukraine have exacerbated food insecurity, causing rising food prices and reduced availability. This paper uses a SWOT framework to analyze Moldova's agri-food security, identifying areas for improvement and potential strategies for enhancing resilience and sustainability. Findings emphasize the importance of integrated, multi-sectoral approaches, promoting sustainable agricultural practices, investing in modern technologies, and fostering collaboration among the government, international organizations, and stakeholders. By addressing these challenges and leveraging opportunities, Moldova can improve the long-term resilience and competitiveness of its agri-food sector while ensuring food security for its population.

AB  - Food insecurity and the weak position of smallholders in food value chains are key challenges in many lowand middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa. In order to increase food security and make agricultural value chains more inclusive, donors, governments and researchers increasingly stimulate partnerships between multiple actors, in which knowledge exchange, joint learning and knowledge co-creation play a central role in reducing the time lag between research findings and their translation into practical outcomes. Yet, despite the growing body of literature on multi-actor and cross-sector learning in these partnerships, an overview of existing literature and a strong evidence base of results of knowledge co-creation in these platforms is missing. Based on a systematic literature review, this paper documents existing evidence of knowledge co-creation processes in multi-stakeholder platforms (MSPs) in sub-Saharan Africa. Findings reveal, first, many examples of positive results, including increased yields and income for farmers; policy, regime and institutional changes; and changes in environmental sustainability. Second, there are several limitations to what MSPs can achieve, including limited attention for scaling up and a lack of sustainability due to dependency on donor funding. Third, there are limitations related to the evidence base: there is a tendency to report less on failures and available findings on the effectiveness of MSPs are mixed. Considering the evidence base, we conclude that there is a need to systematically document, report and assess MSPs and not take their effectiveness for granted. A systematic literature review thereby has an important added value because the critical assessment of methodological rigour increases the credibility of results documented in the included studies.

AB  - This article investigates corporate responses to environmental regulation of fish farming in Norway, the world's largest producer and exporter of salmon. We note a puzzling strategic divergence within the industry: whereas small firms have strongly opposed new standards, large and multinational firms have supported or even demanded stricter regulation. Traditional models for business response strategies can explain this divergence only partly. We develop a supplementary, explanatory perspective focusing on company size and predatory opportunities, to show how large and dominant corporate players can use environmental regulation strategically to strengthen their competitive advantages at the expense of small and weaker rivals. This highlights a neglected dimension of regulatory effects and motives behind corporate demand for strict and costly standards. It aso shows how environmental regulations may cause trade-offs with local development concerns, relevant to other natural resource-based sectors evolving from smaller-scale production towards full-fledged industrialization.

AB  - Eggs are an increasingly significant source of protein for human consumption, and the global poultry industry is the single fastest-growing livestock sector. In the context of international concern for food security and feeding an increasingly affluent human population, the contribution to global greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions from animal protein production is of critical interest. We calculated the GHG emissions footprint for the fastest-growing sector of the UK egg market: free-range production in small commercial units on mixed farms. Emissions are calculated to current Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and UK standards (PAS2050): including direct, indirect, and embodied emissions from cradle to farm gate compatible with a full product life-cycle assessment. We present a methodology for the allocation of emissions between ruminant and poultry enterprises on mixed farms. Greenhouse gas emissions averaged a global warming potential of 2.2 kg of CO(2)e/dozen eggs, or 1.6 kg of CO2 equivalent (e)/kg (assuming average egg weight of 60 g). one kilogram of protein from free-range eggs produces 0.2 kg of CO(2)e, lower than the emissions from white or red meat (based on both kg of meat and kg of protein). of these emissions, 63% represent embodied carbon in poultry feed. A detailed GHG emissions footprint represents a baseline for comparison with other egg production systems and sources of protein for human consumption. Eggs represent a relatively low-carbon supply of animal protein, but their production is heavily dependent on cereals and soy, with associated high emissions from industrial nitrogen production, land-use change, and transport. Alternative sources of digestible protein for poultry diets are available, may be produced from waste processing, and would be an effective tool for reducing the industry's GHG emissions and dependence on imported raw materials.

AB  - Cropland conversion is a significant theme of the influence of human activities on ecological systems and global food security. Conventionally, cropland conversion in China has been deemed to match the dynamic balance of cropland resources well and to ensure food security for the whole country. However, local studies have presented some conflicting signs that call for an integrated analysis from a national viewpoint. In this paper, by considering the significance of slope in cropland-related natural and socioeconomic issues, we explore the slope features of China's cropland conversion during 2000-2015 and endeavor to identify some potential risks hidden in the process. High-resolution remotely sensed images, digital elevation model and spatial analytical methods are adopted to conduct the analysis. The results show that, the features of cropland conversion in diverse slope division areas are all distinct. Some risks indicated by these conversion features can be identified as follows: (1) unsuitable reclamation of cropland in flat areas causes ecological damage, (2) the invasion of sparsely populated construction land on cropland in steep areas has a dramatic impact on the local area, (3) excessive greening in Northwest and Northeast China, and insufficient greening in Southwest China are not healthy for regional sustainability, (4) cropland's upslope reclamation and downslope loss pose potential risks for food security. In the context of dynamic balance management and other related national policies, cropland conversion in China is not as optimistic as former surveys have indicated, and promoted measures should be elaborately adjusted based on local conditions.

AB  - Temperate forests are key to the balance and provision of hydrological and environmental services. Currently, these forests are subject to human alterations as well as to the effects of global change, including warming, variability, deforestation, and forest fires. As a consequence, the hydrological balance has been modified. The present study simulates the effects of climate change and land use change on the hydrological balance of micro-watersheds in Mexico using the hydrological model Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP). The land use change between 1995 and 2021 was estimated to establish a baseline. Climate scenario SSP585 was projected using three global models, MPI-ESM1-2-LR, HadGEM3-GC31-LL, and CNRM-CM6-1 by the 2081-2100 horizon, along with two scenarios of land use change: one with forest permanence and another with loss of forest cover and increased forest fires. Results indicate that future climatic conditions will modify the hydrological balance at the microbasin level. Even with positive conditions of forest permanence, increases in surface runoff of 124% (CNRM), 35% (HadGEM3), and 13% (MPI) are expected. The projections of coverage loss and fires showed surface runoff increases of 338% (CNRM), 188% (HadGEM3), and 143% (MPI). In the high areas of the microbasins where temperate forest predominates, climatic variations could be contained. If the forest is conserved, surface runoff decreases by -70% (CNRM), -87% (HadGEM3), and -89% (MPI). Likewise, the moisture in the soil increases. In areas with temperate forests, there will be modifications of the hydrological balance mainly due to the increase in evapotranspiration (due to the increase in temperature and precipitation). This will cause a significant decrease in flow and interflow. The alteration of these flows will decrease water availability in soil for infiltration. It is expected that the availability of hydrological and environmental services will be compromised in the entire study area due to climate change.

AB  - Energy is a key factor in the economic development. Currently, however, millions of people across the world suffer from energy poverty, having little or no access to energy for cooking, lighting, heating, cooling, or using information and communication technologies. Objective of this study was to investigate the domestic energy sources for households and the impact of biomass use as a source of energy on the environment and food insecurity in the drought-affected northern highlands of Ethiopia. A total of 398 household heads were interviewed using a structured questionnaire, whereas 16 focus group discussions and 12 key informant interviews were conducted. Descriptive data analysis techniques were used to analyze quantitative data while content analysis methods were used to analyze qualitative data. The use of traditional biomass fuels such as firewood, charcoal, crop residue, animal dung, and biomass residue that can be combusted were prevalent in the area, which aggravated the degradation of agricultural lands. As commented by the majority of respondents, the move towards the adoption of modern energy sources was not common due to finance (98%), access (97%), durability (97%) and lack of awareness (93%). The findings showed that land degradation has been severe to the extent that no grain yield can be collected from crop production. As a result, people were exposed to both chronic and transitory food insecurity, and hence the majority of people make their living on food aid. In food-insecure areas, relying on biomass energy could increase land degradation or retard the speed of land restoration, which adversely affects agricultural production and food security. Investing in alternative energy technologies can improve the environment, food security, and people's health.

AB  - It is generally accepted that in order to preserve the sustainability of resource utilization worldwide, it is imperative to maximize the positive environmental effects and minimize the negative ones in agriculture. To assess the impact of agricultural ecosystems on environmental footprints in China, this study used a timeseries econometric approach spanning the period from 1990 to 2020. The suitability of the variables was confirmed through stationarity tests, followed by the application of the Johansen technique. The Johansen technique's findings showed that long-run co-integration is present in both exogenous and endogenous variables. Moreover, the bound testing technique with the ARDL model was applied to validate the long-run results. The findings revealed a positive correlation between agricultural ecological footprints and factors such as agricultural land, energy consumption, fertilizer usage, and agricultural employment with short-run elasticity. In the long run, agricultural land, energy consumption, and fertilizer usage were all identified as having a positive impact on the ecological footprint. Consequently, the agricultural ecosystem faces strain due to stringent agricultural practices aimed at enhancing production. The integration of modern technology becomes imperative to reduce carbon emissions, promote environmentally-friendly industries, and enhance the nation's land bio-capacity, thereby mitigating the strain on the ecological ecosystem. This study offers valuable insights for academia, policymakers, researchers, and planners in formulating a comprehensive strategy and vision for establishing sustainable food production and fostering favorable environmental conditions, particularly pertinent to China and with broader applicability to the global context.

AB  - Concerns about the impacts of climate change have led to increased targets for biofuel in the global energy market. First-generation biofuel crops contain oil, sugar or starch and are usually also grown for food, whereas second-generation biofuel is derived from non-food sources, including lignocellulosic crops, fast-growing trees, crop residues and waste. Biofuel production drives land-use change, a major cause of biodiversity loss, but there is limited knowledge of how different biofuel crops affect local biodiversity. Therefore, a more detailed understanding could inform more environmentally-conscious decisions about where to grow which biofuel crops. We synthesised data from 116 sources where a potential biofuel crop was grown and estimated how two measures of local biodiversity, species richness and total abundance, responded to different crops. Local species richness and abundance were 37% and 49% lower at sites planted with first-generation biofuel crops than in sites with primary vegetation. Soybean, wheat, maize and oil palm had the worst effects; the worst affected regions were Asia and Central and South America; and plant species richness and vertebrate abundance were the worst affected biodiversity measures. Second-generation biofuels had smaller, but still significant, effects: species richness and abundance were 19% and 25%, respectively, lower in such sites than in primary vegetation. Our models suggest that land clearance to cultivate biofuel crops reduces local biodiversity. However, the yield of biofuel from different crops influences the biodiversity impacts per unit of energy generated, and the geographic and taxonomic variation in effects are also relevant for making sustainable land-use decisions.

AB  - Much of the research on food security in Ethiopia focuses on the rural poor, paying very little attention to the urban poor. The urban poor, marginalized from employment opportunities and other services, are usually made invisible by the government. Hence, exploring the invisible crisis of urban food security can help policymakers to design and implement effective strategies to reduce food insecurity. Study results indicated that unpredictable market prices, lack of employment opportunities, and distress-coping strategies are indicators of household food insecurity. In conclusion, the study argues that attaining food security must be an urgent government concern in urban areas.

AB  - The sustainability of food chains is an issue consumers, policy makers, researchers, food producers and suppliers are increasingly interested in. This interest is also confirmed by the considerable development of short food supply chain (SFSC) initiatives as an alternative to the globalised food chains typical of the contemporary food industry. However, while SFSCs have grown over the recent years, their logistics is still a challenging issue affecting their performance. Previous SFSC-focused literature reviews have neglected this particular aspect, concentrating primarily on the different forms of supply chains and the benefits and limitations associated with SFSC. The goal of this paper, instead, is to increase researchers? and practitioners? knowledge of the role and potential of logistics in improving the effectiveness and sustainability of SFSCs. This work, in fact, focuses on this specific and relevant aspect of SFSC and highlights its possible impact on SFSC development. From a logistics perspective, it identifies a series of actions to be implemented to effectively improve SFSC: to make environmental sustainable choices during all the phases of food distribution, to optimise the location of supply chain nodes, to improve the distribution route and restructure the supply chain. In addition to these actions, farmers are required to adopt an open approach to innovative distribution systems, vertical and horizontal collaboration as well as to cooperation with researchers. The paper's conclusions provide suggestions for future research development and underline the necessity to adopt a holistic and integrated approach and abandon a retrospective evaluation analysis in favour of a more dynamic and future-orientated attitude.

AB  - The paper provides a general framework of nonnative agricultural policy analysis within which it is possible to unify forty years of literature. It is shown that the literature has gone from examining a very small set of simple policies to a much broader set of policies that combine policy instruments simultaneously. In ranking alternative policies agricultural economists have tried to consider distributive equity. I While at a glance it may seem that many different methods have been used to consider distributive equity, we show that in general all these methods can be traced back to three alternative methods based on welfarism and Pareto efficiency.

AB  - We carried out a life cycle assessment to model the potential for alternative household vegetable gardens (AHHVGs) to mitigate global climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) for Santa Barbara County, California, USA. Our model included changes in GHGE due to the effect of creating an AHHVG for five components: reduction of lawn area due to replacement by the AHHVG; reduction of vegetables purchased from the conventional agrifood system due to replacement by vegetables produced in the AHHVG; reduction in amount of greywater exported to treatment facilities due to diversion to irrigate the AHHVG; reduction in amount of household organic waste exported to treatment facilities due to diversion to composting at the household level for application to the AHHVG; and composting organic household waste for use in the AHHVG. We found that AHHVGs could reduce emissions by over 2 kg CO(2)e kg(-1) vegetable, but that results were sensitive to the range of values for the key variables of yield and alternative methods for processing household organic waste. In our baseline scenario (50% of singlefamily households with an 18.7 m(2) AHHVG, providing 50% of their vegetable consumption), AHHVGs contributed 3.3% of the GHGE reduction goals of unincorporated Santa Barbara County for 2020, 0.5% of the goals for the City of Santa Barbara for 2050, and by extrapolation, 7.8% of the goals for California for 2020. Our results could provide an incentive for governments to include support of AHHVG as part of climate mitigation strategies, and for households to grow vegetables in AHHVGs to address climate change.

AB  - Global food security has been in a severe condition in recent years, especially in developing countries. These countries need sufficient investment to promote their agricultural development. At the same time, the increasing foreign investment in agriculture has aroused widespread concern in the international community. It is controversial whether it is conducive to the host country's agriculture and social development. In order to study whether developing countries can promote food security by absorbing adequate and effective foreign agricultural investment, we use principal component analysis and select 135 countries (regions) as samples to construct an indicator system from three aspects: investment demand, investment environment and investment motivation. We use cross-section data consisting of the values of the most recent year updated for each indicator. The results show that the demand for foreign investment in developing countries is strong, but overall, it does not have much investment appeal and the investment environment is bad. There is a gap between the expectations and realities in societies in each developing country in terms of the introduction of foreign agricultural investment to promote food security. Governance and capacity building should be strengthened to reconcile their investment needs with investors' motives. Meanwhile, more inclusive rules for foreign agricultural investment will help it to play its due role in developing countries.

AB  - Periurban agriculture is being hit by the effects of the globalized food system, as well as by concrete aspects of urban sprawl. Nonetheless, proximity to the main markets provides an opportunity to sustain agriculture in highly urbanized areas. In this sense, an increasing number of local initiatives is arising within the context of Short Food Supply Chains (SFSCs). The economic impact of these initiatives, however, is limited by problems and inefficiencies that hinder their capacity to scale up. The present paper sets forth the results of a research project developed in Madrid and Cataluna. The study is based upon documentary and empirical research addressing the main problems periurban farmers are facing in relation to local food distribution. Among other factors, these refer to regulatory barriers, logistics, competition and dealing with consumers' preferences. We conducted a questionnaire with a representative group of farmers from each region in three towns presenting different demographic sizes along with another questionnaire extended to the owners of small grocery stores, who play a vital role in the supply of fresh food in these municipalities. Our research demonstrates that most of the problems arising when dealing with SFSCS can be solved by introducing new forms of cooperation among the different agents of the food chain.

AB  - This study evaluated the prevalence and relationship of food security, dietary choices, and health status within the Butte County Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) in California. One hundred fifty-five postpartum non-lactating female WIC participants were surveyed on their health and food security status through validated measures and their dietary choices through 7 Likert statements. Participants who were food insecure scored significantly lower on the general and mental health scales and their diet choice score. The participants' dietary choices also affected mental and general health scores. Food insecurity significantly increased the likelihood of having a lower mental health score and seldom or never eating 21/2 cups of vegetables per day. These results suggest that food insecurity is associated with decreased general and mental health and vegetable consumption among Butte County WIC participants.

AB  - Perennial export crops such as cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) and coffee (Coffea spp. L.) contribute indirectly to food security by providing an income that can be used to buy food, household goods and/or supplies for the cultivation of basic food crops. Thus, any perennial crop loss incurred due to the effects of climate change will also negatively impact food security and, more generally, the livelihoods of smallholders, farmers and rural communities. It is foreseen that in the not so distant future (2050), climate change and increased land use for food crop production, to meet increasing demands for food as the world's population increases, will negatively impact global production of perennial crops such as coffee and cocoa by reducing the availability of land suitable for their cultivation. Furthermore, the current trend towards full sun systems with excessive use of external inputs (agrochemicals, irrigation) increases the vulnerability of the cocoa and coffee sectors to climate change. To reconcile the need for food crops and the demand for export crops such as coffee and cocoa, under the scenarios of climate change and population growth, innovative production systems have to be developed. Such systems should also contribute to the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change and provide other ecosystem services such as regulation of pests and diseases. Agroforestry systems are some of the production systems which can address these manifold demands. Here, ideas for the development of competitive and sustainable agroforestry systems and the evaluation of their environmental benefits are presented and reviewed.

AB  - Food banks play a major role in the food aid sector by distributing donated and purchased groceries directly to food insecure families. The public health implications of food insecurity are significant, particularly as food insecurity has a higher prevalence among certain population groups. This review consolidates current knowledge about the function and efficacy of food banks to address food insecurity. A systematic review was conducted. Thirty-five publications were reviewed, of which 14 examined food security status, 13 analysed nutritional quality of food provided, and 24 considered clients' needs in relation to food bank use. This review found that while food banks have an important role to play in providing immediate solutions to severe food deprivation, they are limited in their capacity to improve overall food security outcomes due to the limited provision of nutrient-dense foods in insufficient amounts, especially from dairy, vegetables and fruits. Food banks have the potential to improve food security outcomes when operational resources are adequate, provisions of perishable food groups are available, and client needs are identified and addressed.

AB  - Introduction The main objective of the study was to explore the contribution of urban agriculture (UA) to the household food security of urban farmers in Addis Ababa, using Kirkos Subcity as a case study.Methods Both quantitative and qualitative research approaches were employed to ascertain and describe the characteristics of variables of interest. The data collection involved surveys and interviews with urban farmers.Results The study revealed that 48.2% of respondents were food secure, while 23.1% and 28.7% were mildly or moderately food insecure, respectively. Additionally, 33.8% of respondents believed that urban agriculture helped them meet their daily food needs, while the remaining respondents felt it was insufficient. Approximately 47.2% of respondents reported that UA helped them meet their food requirements year-round, whereas 22.6% said it was unable to cover their year-round needs. Most respondents indicated that their income increased due to engaging in urban agriculture. Furthermore, 72.3% of respondents had access to land resources for urban agriculture, while 27.7% did not have access to land. The ordinal logistic regression model indicated that age, family size, formal education, household head, monthly income, marital status, educational level, main income source, farming experience, land access, and market access were statistically significant predictors of household food security.Discussion The prevalence of food insecurity among urban households engaged in agriculture highlights the need for additional support and increased intensity of various types of urban agriculture. Policymakers should consider integrating urban agriculture into urban planning strategies to enhance food security and resilience in urban areas.

AB  - Simple Summary The relationship between the rates of world population growth and the consumption of natural resources is a subject of strong debate in the political and academic areas. Since the 1960s, technological progress has made it possible to achieve extraordinary increases in agricultural productivity, which was at the basis of the so-called green revolution. However, this happened at the expense of environmental sustainability. Agricultural activities impact natural resources such as water, air, biodiversity, which are crucial for future generations. The livestock sector is particularly sensitive to the problem, being responsible for an important part of the global greenhouse gas emissions. To make livestock production more sustainable, a radical rethinking of livestock production models is required. In the face of these needs, the circular economy provides a sound basis for a sustainable transition. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the crucial factors for a transition towards more "circularized" animal production systems. More precisely, our work aims to identify economic, social, and environmental factors that can boost transition, by framing it within a circular vision of livestock farming. This paper deals with a relevant topic in the literature on sustainable management of animal farms, concerning the transition towards circular methods of animal production. The paper aims to put forward an original analytical multilevel perspective overlapping different dimensions at either micro, meso, and macro level. Starting from the Malthusian analysis on depletion of natural resources, with risks of the fragility of the natural and economic systems, the paper points out the importance of moving away from intensive methods of production, by adopting more circularized approaches based on resources efficiency. The application of circular economy approaches to animal production is theorized through the concept of territorial metabolism involving not only internal resources (at the animal farm level) but also territorial resources. The paper underlines the critical points of the transition, which is labeled as a socio-technical transition in that it involves not only technical issues but also social aspects. Critical points are addressed through consumers' acceptance of products drawn on circular approaches and political support to transition, through political tools which are boosted in recent documents of the European Union, like the Green Deal and Farm to Fork strategy.

AB  - Silicon (Si) is a "quasi-essential " element, associated to stresses/limitations alleviation in crops. However, stressful situations are becoming the norm, due to climate change, human exhaustion of natural resources, land degradation and loss of soil biodiversity. In this context, Si becomes a critical element, capacitating crops to grow more and better with less. A total of 467 articles up to 2021 were selected, reporting 501 experiments (lab-oriented and field trials) resulting in 682 cases where different Si-based fertilizers were used to study crops/plants with agronomic value to evaluate its physiological and/or agronomic performance under a specific motivation. Results show that 63% of cases testing Si-fertilization show increase in productivity, while 13% refuted this observation and 24% did not evaluate plant growth. Crop physiological responses was registered in 42% of the cases and only 3% did not report any alteration, although 55% did not evaluate these indicators. Symptom alleviation, in cases where stresses/limitations were studied, was registered in 74% of the cases with a low number of negative outcomes (9%). Field trials where crop yield was measured after application of Si-fertilization show that 69% of different measurements (599) register a yield improvement >= 5%, while 18% of the measurements registered between 0 and 5% and only 14% reported yield loss. Si-fertilization is therefore and important factor to improve crop yield and capacitate crops with resilience to endure future limitations. Its inclusion in modern agriculture should be considered in larger scales to adapt crops to the current challenges of sustainable agriculture and food provision.

AB  - Agricultural ecosystems produce food, fiber, and non-marketed ecosystem services (ES). Agriculture also typically involves high negative external costs associated with, for example, fossil fuel use. We estimated, via field-scale ecological monitoring and economic value-transfer methods, the market and nonmarket ES value of a combined food and energy (CFE) agro-ecosystem that simultaneously produces food, fodder, and bioenergy. Such novel CFE agro-ecosystems can provide a significantly increased net crop, energy, and nonmarketed ES compared with conventional agriculture, and require markedly less fossil-based inputs. Extrapolated to the European scale, the value of nonmarket ES from the CFE system exceeds current European farm subsidy payments. Such integrated food and bioenergy systems can thus provide environmental value for money for European Union farming and nonfarming communities.

AB  - Understanding the factors associated with adoption of ecological farming practices is a well-established topic of interest to agricultural economists. As the transition to more sustainable agriculture has become a policy priority for the European Union, broad and balanced reviews of this literature are important. We develop a systematic map of quantitative observational studies which describes the ecological practice(s) adopted, the frequency of inclusion and significance of a range of independent variables, and how the dependent variable is measured. We also conduct a quality assessment. We find that while socio-demographic variables and farm structural variables are frequently included, they were insignificant more often than they were significant. For behavioural factors we find stronger evidence for the importance of cognitive or attitudinal variables compared to dispositional attitudinal variables. We also find a growing interest in social factors which will be valuable for researchers to explore further and reflect on the policy implications of our findings.

AB  - India will need to produce 30% more wheat by 2050, and these gains must principally come from intensification in eastern India where low productivity is common. Through a dense network of on-farm surveys for the rice-wheat system in this region, we show that contemporary wheat sowing dates have a central influence on achieved and attainable yields, superseding all other crop management, soil and varietal factors. We estimate that untapped wheat production potential will increase by 69% with achievable adjustments to wheat sowing dates without incurring undesirable trade-offs with rice productivity, irrigation requirements or profitability. Our findings also indicate that transformative gains in wheat yields are only possible in eastern India if rice and wheat are managed as a coupled system. Steps taken to 'keep time' through better management of the annual cropping calendar will pay dividends for food security, profitability and climate resilience now and as a foundation for adaptation to progressive climate change. Current cropping calendar management erodes wheat yield potential in the rice-wheat cropping system of eastern India. By combining field and household survey data, time series of remotely sensed information and dynamic crop simulations, this study shows that exploitable wheat yield gaps could increase by 69% through planting date adjustments that enhance climate resilience.

AB  - This article employs a multiple-case study research design to unpack the complex relationship between digital transformation, agility, and environmental sustainability in the agri-food industry. Our findings show that to achieve a cleaner food production that does not compromise the natural life cycle, firms need to deploy nature -driven agility, a novel type of agility. We conceptualized nature-driven agility as the firm ability to flexibly and effectively utilize natural resources to adapt the full production process to market changes and capture new value-creation opportunities within nature constraints. This study found that nature-driven agility relies on digital technologies to make predictions about natural resource dynamics that may impact the critical steps of the agri-food production process. We also identify some factors that clarify how the benefits of nature-driven agility on cleaner food production strongly depend on managers' commitment to environmental sustainability and the pressure of customers for new products aligned with ecological sustainability purposes. Finally, we synthesized the findings in the Nature-driven Agility (NaDrA) framework, which practitioners can use to design proper operations that capture value-creation opportunities while improving agri-food firms' environmental performance.

AB  - Smallholder agriculture is an important source of livelihoods in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. In these regions the highest concentrations of nutritionally vulnerable populations are found. Agricultural development needs to be nutrition-sensitive, and contribute simultaneously to improving household nutrition, farm productivity and environmental performance. We explored the windows of opportunities for farm development and the potential of crop diversification options for meeting household dietary requirements, whilst concurrently improving household economic performance in contrasting smallholder farm systems in Kenya and Vietnam. Farm and household features and farmer perspectives and priorities were integrated into a farm-household model that allowed quantification of a diverse set of nutritional, labour and productive indicators. Using a multi-objective optimization algorithm, we generated 'solution spaces' comprising crop compositions and management configurations that would satisfy household dietary needs and allowed income gains. Results indicated site-specific synergies between income and nutritional system yield for vitamin A. Diversification with novel vegetables could cover vitamin A requirements of 10 to 31 extra people per hectare and lead to greater income (25 to 185% increase) for some households, but reduced leisure time. Although the Vietnamese sites exhibited greater nutrient system yields than those in Kenya, the household diets in Kenya had greater nutrient adequacy due to the fact that the Vietnamese farmers sold greater proportions of their on-farm produced foods. We conclude that nutrition-sensitive, multi-method approaches have potential to identify solutions to simultaneously improve household income, nutrition and resource management in vulnerable smallholder farming systems.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic profoundly disrupted global food systems, aggravating vulnerabilities in consumption, production, hygiene, and access. These disruptions intensified economic instability and reduced the production capacity of small and medium-sized agribusinesses, widening the gap between food supply and demand and contributing to a dramatic rise in global undernourishment. Economic fallout and price inflation compounded these issues, particularly affecting low-income countries and exacerbating social inequities. The recent escalation in global food crises, exacerbated by events such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine and climate change, underscores the urgent need for a transformative approach to food ecosystems. This article examines the critical role of intellectual property (IP) and trade in fostering equitable food governance, particularly within the post-pandemic and post-crisis global legal order. It assesses how IP and trade mechanisms might bridge gaps in food security and advance the right to food as part of a broader human rights framework. Using equity as a guiding concept, this article analyzes ongoing initiatives at the World Trade Organization and the World Intellectual Property Organization, focusing on recent developments in trade negotiations and the International Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources, and Traditional Knowledge. Through these lenses, the article evaluates the potential of IP and trade instruments to support sustainable, inclusive, and equitable food governance, highlighting how these tools can address emerging challenges in agri-food innovation, food sovereignty, and climate resilience.

AB  - This article studies trade-offs of farms in terms of economic sustainability (proxied here by technical efficiency), environmental sustainability (proxied here by farmers' commitment towards the environment) and social sustainability (proxied here by farmers' contribution to on farm well-being and communities' well-being). We use the latent class stochastic frontier model and create classes based on three separating variables, representing farms' environmental sustainability and social sustainability. The application to a sample of Spanish crop farms shows that more environmentally sustainable farms are likely to have lower levels of technical efficiency. However, improvements in social concerns, both towards own farm and the larger community, may lead to improved technical efficiency levels. In general, our study provides evidence of trade-offs for farms between economic sustainability and environmental sustainability, but also between environmental sustainability and social sustainability.

AB  - Soils are a source of natural capital that provide and regulate a range of ecosystem services (ES) and play an important role in sustaining human welfare. Nonetheless, the quality and quantity of soil ecosystem services (SES) delivery over the long term depend on the use of sustainable land management practices. In the present study, we assessed seven SES using a set of soil quality indicators in four production systems based on yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis A. St.-Hil) in the Araucaria Forest biome of Southern Brazil: two sites were under traditional agroecological agroforestry management, one was a silvopastoral system with dairy pasture, and the last one was a monoculture yerba mate production system. The SES measured were soil fertility, carbon sequestration, erosion control, nutrient cycling, plant provision, biodiversity, and health. Soil samples were collected at various depths and analysed for chemical, physical, and biological attributes. A principal component analysis on the dataset showed that the soil quality indicators that best represent the variance between the systems at the 0-10 cm layer were acidity, microbial activity (FDA), total nitrogen, (TN), structural stability index (SSI), cation exchange capacity (CEC), pH, sum of bases (SB), microbial quotient (qMic), density of earthworms (EwD), bulk density (BD), and carbon stocks (Cstock). Soil quality indicators ranging from 0 to 1 were used to graphically represent the set of SES. The indicator-based approach used to explain the differences among the four production systems was able to capture the soil functions and offered a good starting point for quantifying SES provision.

AB  - An ecosystem-based management approach (EBM) is suggested as one solution to help to tackle environmental challenges facing worldwide farming systems whilst ensuring socio-economic demands are met. Despite its usefulness, the application of this approach at the farm-scale presents several implementation problems, including the difficulty of (a) incorporating the concept of ecosystem services (ES) into agricultural land use decision-making and (b) involving the farmer in the planning process. This study aims to propose a solution to overcome these challenges by utilising a geodesign framework and EBM approach to plan and design a sus-tainable multifunctional agricultural landscape at the farm scale. We demonstrate how the proposed approach can be applied to plan and design multifunctional agricultural landscapes that offer improved sustainability, using a New Zealand hill country farm as a case study. A geodesign framework is employed to generate future land use and management scenarios for the study area, visualize changes, and assess the impacts of future land use on landscape multifunctionality and the provision of associated ES and economic outcomes. In this frame-work, collaboration with the farmer was carried out to obtain farm information and co-design the farmed landscapes. The results from our study demonstrate that farmed landscapes where multiple land use/ land cover types co-exist can provide a wide range of ES and therefore, meet both economic and environmental demands. The assessment of impacts for different land use change scenarios demonstrates that land use change towards increasing landscape diversity and complexity is a key to achieving more sustainable multifunctional farmed landscapes. The integration of EBM and geodesign, is a transdisciplinary approach that can help farmers target land use and management decisions by considering the major ES that are, and could be, provided by the landscapes in which these farm systems are situated, therefore maximising the potential for beneficial outcomes.

AB  - The European Union (EU) is a major consumer of forest -risks commodities and therefore a key contributor to imported deforestation. In 2023, the EU Regulation on Deforestation -Free Products (EUDR) entered into force, which aims to counter the imported deforestation resulting from EU consumption of cattle, cocoa, coffee, palm oil, rubber, soy, wood and derived products. With this regulation, the EU is seemingly recognising its position as one of the world's largest consumers of natural resources and land -consuming agricultural products and adjusting its economy in the face of the global biodiversity, climate and planetary justice crises. In this article, we develop a radical transformation framework to put the EUDR to the test, asking to what extent the EUDR provides a truly transformative response to today's planetary socio-ecological and justice crises. We develop a fourpronged radical transformation framework bridging insights from transformation, degrowth, Indigenous and decolonial environmental justice, restorative justice and science and technology studies. Concretely, we distil four tenets of radical transformation: onto-epistemic transformation, political transformation, economic transformation and judicial transformation. We apply our framework tentatively to the EUDR to illustrate its practical use, raise questions and highlight possible points of tension. Our preliminary findings point to the simultaneous existence in the EUDR's design of elements potentially paving the way for counter-hegemonic (re)interpretations and uses on the ground and elements reflecting and reinscribing existing hegemonies.

AB  - Transhumant pastoralism guided by traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) helps people in adapting to extreme biophysical conditions and remoteness in the high-altitude region of the western Himalaya. However, the age-old practice is currently under threat due to changes in socioeconomic, policy and environmental conditions, which may lead to erosion of pastoralism-related TEK. This study was undertaken to document traditional knowledge concerning transhumant pastoralism of the Kinnaura community in three high-altitude villages, namely Chhitkul, Rakchham and Batseri in the Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh, India, using semi-structured interviews and participant observation methods. A total of 38 key informants were interviewed to elicit information about the contemporary practices and TEK related to transhumant pastoralism. The study found that the transhumant pastoralism is not only intricately linked to sociocultural life but also contribute significantly to the livelihood of Kinnaura community and hired herders. Findings revealed that the pastoralists are the repository of vast knowledge on various aspects of sheep- and goat-based transhumance, viz. herd composition and management, grazing and supplementary feeding and ethnoveterinary practices. It is concluded that the study would help policy decisions for the preservation and protection of transhumant pastoralism-related TEK of the indigenous Kinnaura pastoralists. Further, considering the nexus between TEK and ecosystem services, this study would also contribute in well-being of the human society and resilience of the similar social-ecological systems.

AB  - In many parts of the forest-agriculture frontiers of the tropics, particularly in Southeast Asia, shifting cultivation is rapidly being transformed to other land uses. Yet, there is rather limited knowledge on the spatial and demographic extent of shifting cultivation and the consequences of the transitions taking place. The proposed mechanism for reduced greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) can be both a challenge and opportunity for shifting cultivators. Very limited literature is available on this dilemma, but a few sources point to benefits from 'compensated reductions' if carbon prices are sufficiently high. The main challenges will be to first ensure that poor farmers have access to the products they no longer farm, second, clarify land tenure of disputed farm and fallow land, and third, provide a guarantee that the compensations will be paid and not be lost in systems of poor governance.

AB  - Despite the benefits resulting from the use of Industry 4.0 technologies in the agri-food sector, the adoption of digital technologies for preventing and/or reducing food loss and waste (FLW) across the agri-food supply chain is still under investigation. In fact, enhancing and optimizing agri-food supply chain operations through digital technologies would just represent a partial effort if FLW prevention and reduction are not effectively addressed. Although companies are starting to adopt digital technologies for eliminating FLW from their operations, the implementation process and the achieved results are generally presented at a superficial level and practical guidance is still missing. This systematic literature review contributes to theory by developing a framework analyzing the state-of-the-art of adoption of each Industry 4.0 technology across the agri-food supply chain, and providing a research agenda structured around the main themes of research design, digital technologies, contextual differences, governance, and sustainability. Eventually, the study also informs managers in the agri-food industry about the potential implementation of digital technologies for preventing and reducing FLW in across the agri-food supply chain.

AB  - The incorporation of science and technology into agriculture has led to enormous growth in crop yields, providing food security in many countries. From the 1950s onwards there has been increasing interference in agricultural policy by a few scientists who are marginal to agriculture and from a variety of unqualified groups. These groups and individuals have used fear and anxiety and have greatly exaggerated minor problems to persuade an unqualified public of supposed dangers in food and to try and change agricultural policy. Fear and emotion do not lead to good policy, and the cult of the amateur that has developed could have serious repercussions on vital food security and future agriculture in developing countries; it must be soundly rejected.

AB  - In a tightly interconnected world, China's food self-sufficiency (FSS) significantly affects global food security. This study incorporates multiple external disturbance risks to improve food security measures through ensemble modeling. On the premise that all people have fair access to food distribution that meets dietary nutritional needs, we estimate China's food supply-demand status in the past 30 years and predict future uncertainty. Results show that the large-scale spatial displacement of farming threatens food supply sustainability. More than current cropland productivity is needed to meet the needs of all food types (with a 5.63 % room for improvement by grain-crop sown area). Despite this, China has high-level food security and stability now. The lower uncertainty limit for the FSS rate will gradually fall below 90 % between 2037 and 2049 only when external disturbances occur simultaneously and remain at the highest level. Consequently, our focus should shift from shortterm self-sufficiency to long-term system resilience.

AB  - Food system analysis in arid and semi-arid countries inevitably meets water availability as a major constraining food system driver. Many such countries are net food importers using food subsidy systems, as water resources do not allow national food self-sufficiency. As this leaves countries in a position of dependency on international markets, prices and export bans, it is imperative that every domestic drop of water is used efficiently. In addition, policies can be geared towards 'water footprints', where water use efficiency is not just evaluated at the field level but also at the level of trade and import/export. In this paper, Egyptian food systems are described based on production, distribution and consumption statistics, key drivers and food system outcomes, i.e., health, sustainable land and water use, and inclusiveness. This is done for three coarsely defined Egyptian food systems: traditional, transitional and modern. A water footprint analysis then shows that for four MENA countries, differences occur between national green and blue water volumes, and the volumes imported through imported foods. Egypt has by far the largest blue water volume, but on a per capita basis, other countries are even more water limited. Then for Egypt, the approach is applied to the wheat and poultry sectors. They show opportunities but also limitations when it comes to projected increased water and food needs in the future. An intervention strategy is proposed that looks into strategies to get more out of the food system components production, distribution and consumption. On top of that food subsidy policies as well as smart water footprint application may lead to a set of combined policies that may lead to synergies between the three food system outcomes, paving the way to desirable food system transformation pathways.

AB  - Nearly every country has committed to minimizing its energy emissions and sharing climate change research, particularly on greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. Therefore, this research aimed to explore the association between renewable (REN) and non-renewable (NREN) energy consumption, total natural resources (TNR), and agricultural greenhouse gas (AGHG) emissions in Pakistan. This study employs a novel dynamic autoregressive distributed lag (DYNARDL) simulation model to estimate the long- and short-term causality among study variables using data from 1990 to 2022. In addition, our study uses a kernel-based regularized leastsquares technique to check the robustness of the DYNARDL findings. Our empirical findings show that the use of renewable energy and natural resources decreases, whereas the utilization of nonrenewable energy increases AGHG emissions in the long run. DYNARDL simulations also show that a positive (+10 %) counterfactual shock change in the projected renewable energy and natural resources leads to a decrease in AGHG emissions, whereas the utilization of NREN leads to increase the AGHG emissions. This study implies that policymakers and stakeholder should rise the share of REN energy and ensure sustainable utilization of natural resources to enhance agricultural sustainability.

AB  - In today 's world, climate change and its unprecedented impact on food and nutrition security have emerged as a significant and formidable global challenge. This study aimed to investigate the effect of adaptation strategies on the food security of small-scale farmers in Khorramabad city, Iran, using a survey -based analysis. To assess the food security level, the Household Food Security Survey Module (HFSSM) was employed. Additionally, Structural Equation Modeling was utilized to examine the relationship between adaptation dimensions and food security. The findings revealed that households without children exhibited a higher level of food security (48%) compared to households with children (6%). Moreover, the results demonstrated a positive and significant correlation between the food security of households, regardless of whether they had children, and the different adaptation components. Despite a satisfactory level of knowledge regarding climate change adaptation in the study area, the actual implementation of such measures remained low. While weed management, agricultural crop insurance, and access to meteorological information were identified as the top three strategies employed by farmers, the results suggested that sustainable -oriented operations and organic -oriented practices could serve as more effective strategies for both climate change resilience and enhancing food security status.

AB  - Although food is an emerging topic on municipal policy and planning agendas, a systematic examination of policy development, its implementation and the instruments used at the urban level is lacking. This study was carried out with the aim of gaining new insights into the prevalence of certain food policy instruments and capacity of policy action. In order to do so, we developed an analytical framework to investigate urban policy and planning approaches related to food issues and applied it in ten large German cities. First, we identified different actor groups and analysed their role in urban food policy (level of involvement in municipal food projects). We then studied the variety of policy and planning instruments and their application for different elements in the food system. For the empirical study, we employed a case study approach and utilised data gathering methods of qualitative research, i.e. expert interviews and document analysis. Our empirical findings in the studied cities reveal that urban food policy activities are still very fragmented and often based on individual initiatives within the administration. Integrated urban food policies and their implementation through urban food strategies are still an exception in major cities in Germany. We found that municipal actors follow mainly sectoral approaches, using a wide array of steering instruments, i.e. informational instruments and public procurement policies. However, their capacities for policy implementation remain limited due to missing financial and staffing resources. Accordingly, the potential the urban food system offers for sustainable development through multifunctionality and sectoral integration, is still underexploited. The systematic approach developed in this study may contribute to a better understanding of different policy approaches taken. The applied typology of policy instruments might also be useful for identifying effective ways to implement urban food strategies, to understand mismatches between instruments and different policy domains, levels and administrative units, e.g. at the urban-rural interface, and to design of new policy instruments.

AB  - Food security is a daily problem for vulnerable groups of urban citizens in developed countries, who face physical and mental stress and poor health outcomes from limited food choices. They are often unable to change their circumstances through the marginalizing impacts of urban planning policy, regulation, and infrastructure barriers. Local government is often confronted with these impacts and absorbs the responsibility to act "on the ground" in the absence of a coordinated, multilevel institutional response. Health professionals and local government urban planners increasingly collaborate to examine the design of cities and towns to improve food security. Despite increased awareness and the inclusion of food security in some planning strategies, regulation, and decision-making, results are limited in many jurisdictions. This research uses a case study methodology to gain insights into the systemic barriers facing local government planners in the state of Victoria, Australia, in responding to municipal food security challenges. Four food-related themes drawn from the data show that both internal systemic barriers and an external lack of fit with federal and state governments blur the understanding of food security challenges and limit planning solutions. Local government planners need consistent legislative and planning scheme priorities, combined with strengthened regulatory tools, to address food security more effectively. Increased feedback opportunities for local government staff to share their valuable experience and knowledge with higher levels of government would allow for a more coordinated approach to addressing this multijurisdictional problem.

AB  - Background: Most agricultural weeds are usually regarded as undesirable and targeted for eradication. However, weeds are useful to human beings as food and traditional medicines. Few studies have been done to document the uses of weeds as traditional vegetables. This study was therefore, done to document indigenous knowledge related to the diversity and use of agricultural weeds as traditional vegetables in Shurugwi District, Zimbabwe, emphasizing their role in food security and livelihoods of the local people. Materials and methods: Semi-structured interviews, observation and guided field walks with 147 participants were employed between December 2011 and January 2012 to obtain ethnobotanical data on the use of edible weeds as traditional vegetables. Based on ethnobotanical information provided by the participants, botanical specimens were collected, numbered, pressed and dried for identification. Results: A total of 21 edible weeds belonging to 11 families and 15 genera, mostly from Amaranthaceae (19%), Asteraceae and Tiliaceae (14.3%), Capparaceae, Cucurbitaceae and Solanaceae (9.5% each) were identified. Of the documented edible weeds, 52.4% are indigenous while 47.6% are exotic to Zimbabwe; either semi-cultivated or growing naturally as agricultural weeds in farmlands, fallow land and home gardens. Among the main uses of edible weeds were leafy vegetables (81%), followed by edible fruits (19%), edible corms (9.5%), edible flowers and seeds (4.8% each). The most important edible weeds were Cleome gynandra, cited by 93.9% of the participants, Cucumis metuliferus (90.5%), Cucumis anguria (87.8%), Corchorus tridens (50.3%) and Amaranthus hybridus (39.5%). All edible weeds were available during rainy and harvest period with Cleome gynandra, Corchorus tridens, Cucumis anguria, Cucumis metuliferus and Moringa oleifera also available during the dry season, enabling households to obtain food outputs in different times of the year. The importance of edible weeds for local livelihoods was ubiquitously perceived, with all participants reporting their contribution towards food security and nutrition. Conclusion: The present study confirm findings from similar studies conducted elsewhere that rural households engage in harvesting of wild edible vegetables and other non-timber forest products (NTFPs) as a survival strategy. Based on their potential nutritional and medicinal value, edible weeds could contribute in a major way to food security, basic primary health care and balanced diets of rural households and possibly urban households as well.

AB  - Land-use transition is one of the most profound human-induced alterations of the Earth's system. It can support better land management and decision-making for increasing the yield of food production to fulfill the food needs in a specific area. However, modeling land-use change involves the complexity of human drivers and natural or environmental constraints. This study develops an agent-based model (ABM) for land use transitions using critical indicators that contribute to food deserts. The model's performance was evaluated using Guilford County, North Carolina, as a case study. The modeling inputs include land covers, climate variability (rainfall and temperature), soil quality, land-use-related policies, and population growth. Studying the interrelationships between these factors can improve the development of effective land-use policies and help responsible agencies and policymakers plan accordingly to improve food security. The agent-based model illustrates how and when individuals or communities could make specific land-cover transitions to fulfill the community's food needs. The results indicate that the agent-based model could effectively monitor land use and environmental changes to visualize potential risks over time and help the affected communities plan accordingly.

AB  - To target food security interventions for smallholder households, decision makers need large-scale information, such as maps on poverty, food security and key livelihood activities. Such information is often based on expert knowledge or aggregated data, despite the fact that food security and poverty are driven largely by processes at the household level. At present, it is unclear if and how household level information can contribute to the spatial prediction of such welfare indicators or to what extent local variability is ignored by current mapping efforts. A combination of geo-referenced household level information with spatially continuous information is an underused approach to quantify local and large-scale variation, while it can provide a direct estimate of the variability of welfare indicators at the most relevant scale. We applied a stepwise regression kriging procedure to translate point information to spatially explicit patterns and create country-wide predictions with associated uncertainty estimates for indicators on food availability and related livelihood activities using household survey data from Uganda. With few exceptions, predictions of the indicators were weak, highlighting the difficulty in capturing variability at larger scale. Household explanatory variables identified little additional variation compared to environmental explanatory variables alone. Spatial predictability was strongest for indicators whose distribution was determined by environmental gradients. In contrast, indicators of crops that were more ubiquitously present across agroecological zones showed large local variation, which often overruled large-scale patterns. Our procedure adds to existing approaches that often only show large-scale patterns by revealing that local variation in welfare is large. Interventions that aim to target the poor must recognise that diversity in livelihood activities for income generation within any given area often overrides the variability of livelihood activities between distant regions in the country.

AB  - How can diversity courses at land-grant universities be shaped to better prepare the next generation of food systems practitioners, educators, and researchers? This is the question I approach in a discussion of the first undergraduate diversity requirement course in a college of agriculture focusing on domestic issues of race, gender, ethnicity, class, and equity in the development of U.S. food systems. I discuss the benefits I found of using food systems studies as a framework for learning about diversity by highlighting the interconnections among people through discussions of issues every student can appreciate: food and eating.

AB  - Gender responsiveness in breeding programs to meet client and end user preferences for crops is essential. This case study analyzes the implementation experience of gender-responsive breeding and variety dissemination in Malawi and Ghana, focusing on good practices and challenges encountered. In Malawi, a training-of-trainers approach was employed to share knowledge among trained farmers. In Ghana, a research study was conducted to identify gender-based preferences for sweetpotato to define breeding objectives. The participation of social scientists, food scientists, and sweetpotato breeders in the GREAT (Gender Researchers Equipped for Agricultural Transformation) team provided a multidisciplinary perspective, addressing questions and responses in the field. Research efforts were strengthened by focusing on food quality through the establishment of an analytical laboratory for rapid evaluation of nutrition and food quality, including sugars. This helped develop sensory analytical capacity to better understand quality attributes and market segments, guiding breeding and improving market opportunities for women. Breeding outcomes resulting from gender inclusion led to the release of some sweetpotato varieties meeting end user and consumer preferences, as well as adoption of OFSP varieties by men and women. Other good practices for gender inclusion and responsiveness include providing funds for gender-based research and activities, engaging gender specialists and social scientists in trans-disciplinary teams, designing program activities with gender considerations, and incorporating traits in seed multiplication and dissemination decisions. Application of these gender inclusion practices resulted in adoption and development of acceptable sweetpotato varieties.

AB  - Globalization of food trade in agricultural commodities is in some senses the antithesis of key concepts of sustainable agriculture. Global trade in food products distances the depletion of resources and environmental impacts of food production from the economic and social processes that drive consumption and increases the global risks from introduction of species that become pests. However, both supply and market value chains have emerged as major sub-systems in the larger global agro-food trade system that exert enormous importance over the potential for change in agricultural production at the farm level. This special issue presents studies of seven value chains that exhibit the breadth of research about value chains and their potential contributions to sustainable agriculture. They address value chains at different scales and dealing in various products. These studies contribute to the body of knowledge with a focus on lesser researched regions and products. Most important, they demonstrate the potential for value chains to enhance agricultural sustainability for rural populations and reduce food insecurity and inequities.

AB  - Industrial food systems are being increasingly challenged by alternative food movements globally that advocate for better environmental, social, economic, and political outcomes as part of societal transitions to more sustainable food systems. At the heart of these transitions are local food producers operating within shorter food supply chains, their experiences, and their knowledge of ecologically sustainable food production, biodiversity and climate, and their communities. Despite their important contributions to the resilience of food systems, society and ecology, local food producers' experiences and knowledges are often undervalued, ignored, or inaccurately reflected. This systematic literature review identifies the values, motivations, and concerns as key elements of the experiences of local food producers within short food supply chains across literature globally, their contributions to social-ecological resilience, and discusses how these experiences and contributions can influence transitions to sustainable food systems. Eighty-five research articles were distilled from 5 databases and thematic analysis revealed four major themes: (1) concerns for exploitative operating contexts and hidden labor expectations within short food supple chains, (2) local food producers' value and need for social networks, (3) their environmental values, connections, and concerns, and (4) how they can value and be motivated by alternative models but are concerned by their economic viability. This review also observed an important paradox within local food producers' experiences showing that whilst farming is a demanding profession and lifestyle, they can feel a deep fulfilment when they live and work in harmony with their values and motivations. This systematic review is significant for how it values and synthesizes the experiences of local food producers and the diverse personal, social, ecological, and economic contributions that local food production has for social-ecological resilience of communities. By better communicating these experiences and contributions to decision-makers, policy makers and planners, this research can have major implications for enabling societal transitions that are fairer and more just in ways that empower, protect, and privilege local food producers' voices.

AB  - Research on the sustainability of capture fisheries has focused more on environmental and economic sustainability than on social sustainability. To assess social sustainability, first relevant and important social sustainability issues need to be identified. The objective of this study was to identify relevant social sustainability issues for cod and haddock fisheries in the northeast Atlantic and to determine the importance of these issues based on stakeholder input. A heterogeneous group of stakeholders was invited to take part in two consecutive surveys on social sustainability issues. The first survey (n = 41) resulted in a long list of 27 relevant social sustainability issues, including six issues that were not identified in previous studies and that address aspects of fish welfare, employees' training and education opportunities, and employees' time off from work. The second survey (n = 51) resulted in a ranking of the social sustainability issues in order of importance. The most important issues are worker safety, product freshness and companies' salary levels. In general, social sustainability issues concerning working conditions, employees' job fulfilment and fish welfare are seen as more important than other social sustainability issues. A main discussion point concerns the relation between the importance of a social sustainability issue on the one hand and the type of need that the issue relates to and the state of the issue on the other hand. From the study it can be concluded that the relative importance of social sustainability issues differs per stakeholder group depending on the relation between the stakeholder group and each particular issue. This demonstrates the importance of consulting different stakeholder groups in future studies on social sustainability in order to get a balanced view on the importance of social sustainability issues. Results on the relevance and importance of social sustainability issues for cod and haddock fisheries in the northeast Atlantic enable the fishing industry and policy-makers to direct improvement efforts towards the more important issues.

AB  - In this paper, we critically interrogate the benefits of an interdisciplinary and theoretically diverse dialogue between 'local food' and 'alternative food networks' (AFNs) and outline how this dialogue might be enriched by a closer engagement with discourses of food sovereignty and the politics of scale. In arguing for a shift towards a greater emphasis on food sovereignty, we contend that contemporary discourses of food security are inadequate for the ongoing task of ensuring a just and sustainable economy of food. Further, rather than treating the local and the global as ontologically given categories around which to contest the politics of food, it is our contention that recognising the socio-spatial aspects of the politics of scale has the potential to reinvigorate discourses of food security, food sovereignty and AFNs. Understanding scale as both fixed to a degree as well as contingent and dynamic has implications for an understanding of the role of food systems, for how the rescaled state privileges certain food systems and the possibilities for resistance through 'jumping scale' and food utopias. All of these aspects are significant if we are to fully comprehend and contest the challenges of envisioning and enacting real utopias of food sovereignty.

AB  - Adoption rates of leguminous crops remain low in sub-Saharan Africa despite their potential role in improving nutrition, soil health, and food security. In this study we explored Malawian farmers' perceptions of various legume attributes and assessed how these perceptions affected allocation of land to legume crops using a logit link model. We found high regional variation in both consumption- and production-related preferences, but relatively consistent preferences across samples. While scientific understanding and farmer perceptions were aligned on some topics and for some legumes, there were discrepancies elsewhere, particularly in terms of soil fertility and nutrition. Understanding why these discrepancies exist and where there were potential biases are critical in explaining the extent of adoption. In many cases perceptions of legume attributes may be influenced by the cultural role of the crop in the household, particularly in terms of food security or market-orientation. The findings also suggest that researchers need to look beyond both the agronomic properties and farmers' preferences to fully understand the extent of adoption. Socioeconomic factors, biases, and marketing concerns may also influence integration of legumes into maize-based cropping systems.

AB  - Palm oil is the most produced edible oil. Typically grown in monoculture in denuded tropical rainforests, cultivation practices of the African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) have drawn criticism from researchers and environmentalists. Previous research has posited oil palm agroforestry as a sustainable alternative to monoculture. Drawing from a series of interviews and field observations, this article examines Bahian oil palm agroecologies in the contexts of Atlantic world historical processes and modernist agricultural development. The analysis reveals how Bahia's subspontaneous oil palm groves and their ethnoecological management systems represent both an important African contribution to colonial landscape transformation and a baseline model for sustainable agriculture.

AB  - IntroductionFood insecurity is associated with inadequate nutrition and increased rates of chronic disease. The primary aim of this study was to assess self-reported food insecurity and the perceived impact of COVID-19 on food security, in two regional districts of Central Fiji, as part of a broader program of work on strengthening and monitoring food policy interventions. The secondary aim was to explore the relationship between food insecurity and salt, sugar and fruit and vegetable intake.MethodsSeven hundred adults were randomly sampled from the Deuba and Waidamudamu districts of Viti Levu, Fiji. Interview administered surveys were conducted by trained research assistants with data collected electronically. Information was collected on demographics and health status, food security, the perceived impact of COVID-19 on food security, and dietary intake. Food insecurity was assessed using nine questions adapted from Fiji's 2014/5 national nutrition survey, measuring markers of food insecurity over the last 12 months. Additional questions were added to assess the perceived effect of COVID-19 on responses. To address the secondary aim, interview administered 24-hour diet recalls were conducted using Intake24 (a computerised dietary recall system) allowing the calculation of salt, sugar and fruit and vegetable intakes for each person. Weighted linear regression models were used to determine the relationship between food insecurity and salt, sugar and fruit and vegetable intake.Results534 people participated in the survey (response rate 76%, 50.4% female, mean age 42 years). 75% (75.3%, 95% CI, 71.4 to 78.8%) of people reported experiencing food insecurity in the 12 months prior to the survey. Around one fifth of people reported running out of foods (16.8%, 13.9 to 20.2%), having to skip meals (19.3%, 16.2 to 22.9%), limiting variety of foods (19.0%, 15.9 to 22.5%), or feeling stressed due to lack of ability to meet food needs (19.5%, 16.4 to 23.0%). 67% (66.9%, 62.9 to 70.7%) reported becoming more food insecure and changing what they ate due to COVID-19. However, people also reported positive changes such as making a home garden (67.8%, 63.7 to 71.6%), growing fruit and vegetables (59.5%, 55.6 to 63.8%), or trying to eat healthier (14.7%, 12.0 to 18.0%). There were no significant associations between food insecurity and intakes of salt, sugar or fruit and vegetables.ConclusionParticipants reported high levels of food insecurity, exceeding recommendations for salt and sugar intake and not meeting fruit and vegetable recommendations, and becoming more food insecure due to COVID-19. Most participants reported making home gardens and/or growing fruit and vegetables in response to the pandemic. There is an opportunity for these activities to be fostered in addressing food insecurity in Fiji, with likely relevance to the Pacific region and other Small Island Developing States who face similar food insecurity challenges.

AB  - Non-point source pollution from agricultural land use is a significant contributor to environmental pollution, causing serious threats to water, air, and soil quality. Environmental regulations have been shown to have a significant negative effect on pollutant emissions. However, empirical studies examining the impact of agricultural environmental regulations on cultivated land non-point source pollution are limited. To explore the effects of environmental regulations on cultivated land non-point source pollution, this study focuses on the Dongting Lake Plain. Using statistical data from 2010 to 2020, we analyze the temporal and spatial changes in cultivated land non-point source pollution before and after the implementation of the "Zero Growth of Fertilizer and Pesticide Use Action Plan". A spatial econometric model is used to assess the impact of environmental regulations on pollution. The results indicate that non-point source pollution in the Dongting Lake Plain shows positive global spatial autocorrelation. Locally, in 2010 and 2015, high-high clusters were dominant, while low-low clusters were less common. By 2020, low-low clusters became the main pattern of pollution. The introduction of the Zero Growth Action Plan had a negative impact on pollution intensity within the region and positive spillover effects on neighboring areas. In terms of emission structure, the plan significantly reduced nitrogen emission intensity and pesticide loss, but had a positive impact on phosphorus emissions. The level of regional economic development had a significant negative effect on pollution intensity, while urbanization had a positive effect. Agricultural technological progress showed a negative spatial spillover effect on phosphorus emissions, and regional economic development had a negative spatial spillover effect on nitrogen and pesticide emissions. This study provides evidence of the impact of environmental regulations on cultivated land non-point source pollution and offers valuable insights for the development of future pollution control policies.

AB  - Outside of the Global North, where agri-food systems have not yet consolidated into a 'funnel shape,' what makes an urban provisioning actor 'alternative' is not always clear. In this paper, I use members' own definitions, emphases, and arguments to differentiate 'alternative' networks from other provisioning actors. Using data from semi-structured interviews, I show that while community-building and an affiliation with the food movement (broadly defined) are the most critical features identified by people who participate in these networks, more informal, ad hoc, familial or village networks that are utilized as a response to urban food insecurity are excluded. While such exclusions may not be unique, in this case, they reflect more fundamental divisions regarding what 'alternative' implies and how to challenge the throttling hold of conventional provisioning agents on the contemporary agri-food system.

AB  - The U.S government has historically responded to human, natural and economic disruptions that threaten food insecurity by modifying federally-funded public food programs. The authors conducted a scoping review to identify and summarize available evidence on the efforts of a 20-year period to modify food benefit programs in response to emergencies; describe how food benefit programs interact to support vulnerable populations; identify key facilitators and barriers to effective implementation and impact; and assess relevance of evidence to COVID19 pandemic. Scoping reviews address broad research questions aimed at mapping key concepts and available evidence in a defined area, and include academic and gray literature and reports from governments and NGOs. This review followed the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews and included a three-stage search strategy. Studies were independently screened for eligibility by two researchers with multiple rounds of review. A content based charting method was used to summarize evidence. More than 2289 documents were identified and screened. After review, 44 documents were analyzed. Only 18% of documents reported program or policy impact data. Additionally, review of 149 policy records from State by State FNS Disaster Assistance Data from Oct 2016-Dec 2020 assessed 96 state specific food policy responses to 72 distinct events. Analysis revealed 53 distinct packages of food policy modifications used in response to crises. This scoping review demonstrates that few studies document the impact on food insecurity of food benefit modifications in response to crises. Most documents present output level details about costs and total number of individuals served. Many documents describe food policy response to crises without providing evaluation of response. Analysis points to SNAP and Child Nutrition Programs as most commonly modified food benefit programs in the wake of U.S. crises. The review concludes with a number of considerations for continued response to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.

AB  - Conservation tillage, particularly no tillage (NT), has been recognized as an efficient farming practice, particularly in dryland agriculture, as it significantly enhances crop yields, improves soil health, and contributes to environmental sustainability. However, the influence of NT on winter wheat radiation interception and utilization, biomass, and yield under NT in irrigated fields, especially under drip fertigation, is unclear. A field experiment was carried out for two growing seasons in Shandong province, China, using a split-plot design with the tillage method as the main plot (no tillage, NT; rotary tillage, RT; and first plowing the soil and then conducting rotary tillage, PRT), and water-nitrogen management as the sub-plot (N fertilizer broadcasting and flood irrigation, BF and drip fertigation, DF). Our results showed that DF increased yield by 11.0-28.5%, but the yield response to DF depended on the tillage methods. NT had the highest response in yield of 26.3-28.5%, followed by RT of 14.6-15.1% and PRT of 11.0-11.9%. Both increased grains per ear and ear number, a result of the greater maximum stems number donating to the yield gain by DF under NT. This gain was also due to the substantially promoted post-anthesis biomass (36.7-47.3%), which resulted from the increased interception of solar radiation and radiation use efficiency after anthesis. In addition, the extended post-anthesis duration also benefited biomass and yield. To conclude, our findings underscore the critical need to optimize water and nitrogen management strategies to maximize yield under conservation tillage systems.

AB  - Objective: In life-cycle assessment, the functional unit defines the unit for calculation of environmental indicators. The objective of the present study was to assess the influence of two functional units, 100 g and 100 kcal (420 kJ), on the associations between three dimensions for identifying sustainable foods, namely environmental impact (via greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE)), nutritional quality (using two distinct nutrient profiling systems) and price. Design: GHGE and price data were collected for individual foods, and were each expressed per 100 g and per 100 kcal. Two nutrient profiling models, SAIN, LIM and UK Ofcom, were used to assess foods' nutritional quality. Spearman correlations were used to assess associations between variables. Sustainable foods were identified as those having more favourable values for all three dimensions. Setting: The French Individual and National Dietary Survey (INCA2), 2006-2007. Subjects: Three hundred and seventy-three foods highly consumed in INCA2, covering 65 % of total energy intake of adult participants. Results: When GHGE and price were expressed per 100 g, low-GHGE foods had a lower price and higher SAIN, LIM and Ofcom scores (r=0.59, -0.34 and -0.43, respectively), suggesting a compatibility between the three dimensions; 101 and 100 sustainable foods were identified with SAIN, LIM and Ofcom, respectively. When GHGE and price were expressed per 100 kcal, low-GHGE foods had a lower price but also lower SAIN, LIM and Ofcom scores (r=0.67, 0.51 and 0.47, respectively), suggesting that more environment-friendly foods were less expensive but also less healthy; thirty-four sustainable foods were identified with both SAIN, LIM and Ofcom. Conclusions: The choice of functional unit strongly influenced the compatibility between the sustainability dimensions and the identification of sustainable foods.

AB  - The long-term sustainability of crop production depends on the complex network of interactions and trade-offs between biotic, abiotic and economic components of agroecosystems. An integrated arable management system was designed to maintain yields, whilst enhancing biodiversity and minimising environmental impact. Management interventions included conservation tillage and organic matter incorporation for soil biophysical health, reduced crop protection inputs and integrated pest management strategies for enhanced biodiversity and ecosystem functions, and intercropping, cover cropping and under-sowing to achieve more sustainable nutrient management. This system was compared directly with standard commercial practice in a split-field experimental design over a six-year crop rotation. The effect of the cropping treatment was assessed according to the responses of a suite of indicators, which were used to parameterise a qualitative multi-attribute model. Scenarios were run to test whether the integrated cropping system achieved greater levels of overall sustainability relative to standard commercial practice. Overall sustainability was rated high for both integrated and conventional management of bean, barley and wheat crops. Winter oilseed crops scored medium for both cropping systems and potatoes scored very low under standard management but achieved a medium level of sustainability with integrated management. In general, high scores for environmental sustainability in integrated cropping systems were offset by low scores for economic sustainability relative to standard commercial practice. This case study demonstrates the value of a 'whole cropping systems' approach using qualitative multi-attribute modelling for the assessment of existing cropping systems and for predicting the likely impact of new management interventions on arable sustainability.

AB  - Agroecology increasingly gains importance in the discussion about sustainable food systems. To facilitate the transition from conventional farming to agroecological farming, adequate methods and concepts to measure and assess impact and productivity of agroecological farming systems (AFSs) are needed, which consider their multifunctionality and other specific characteristics, here called agroecological sustainability assessment frameworks and tools (ASAFTs). In the past years, many agricultural sustainability assessment tools and frameworks were developed but their suitability and applicability to AFSs was not investigated. To close this knowledge gap, we aimed at identifying, reviewing, and discussing published ASAFTs in the context of international cooperation, providing an overview of the current challenges, needs, and requirements in assessing AFSs at the farm level with the means of indicators. Desktop and scientific database research was conducted to identify and discuss published indicator-based ASAFTs at the farm level. The analysis was based on the following four framework elements that the authors considered to be essential for ASAFTs: (1) the adaptability to local conditions all over the world, (2) the involvement of farmers in the development process, (3) the consideration of the multiple functions of an agroecosystem in the definition and measurement of its productivity, and (4) the accounting for interactions between multiple agroecosystem functions and their measurement. Only a few analyzed assessment frameworks at least partly consider these essential elements and were designed specifically for AFSs. However, our study also showed that these frameworks were (1) restricted in their geographical application scope, (2) quite heterogeneous and barely comparable, and (3) based on productivity indicators that do not fully capture the multiple functions of AFSs. Therefore, we identified the need for the development of appropriate agroecological productivity indicators and common standard or reference frameworks for assessing AFSs, which will be crucial for upscaling agroecology.

AB  - Makawanpur district in Central Nepal is considered a biodiversity hotspot of the country. Numerous wild plant species are traditionally used as vegetables and contribute to nutrition and food security of local communities. However, abundance and use of many of these wild vegetables have been decreasing, which calls for domestication and cultivation of priority species. This study aimed at documenting wild vegetable species and their use to develop a priority list for future domestication efforts. Wild vegetables were surveyed in three agro-climatic zones (500-2,200 masl) of the Makawanpur district in natural forest, homegardens, farmer's fields, fallow land, and markets. Information about local names, plant parts used, seasonal availability, mode of consumption, primary consumers, and preference ranking for consumption and sale was gathered during forest/field walks and by semi-structured interviews of 144 respondents (including men, women, and children) of three ethnic groups. Priority setting was based on nine variables related to priorities for taste and sale, species' occurrence in homegardens, wide use among ethnic groups, broad altitude range, harvest season, level of threat as perceived by respondents, children's preference for consumption, and possibility for processing. A total of 89 vegetable species were identified. Forests and fallows were most important for collecting wild vegetables, which were mainly used for home consumption. Only 26 species were also sold in markets. Ethnic group, respondent's age, and altitude of the location had a significant influence on the respondents' knowledge of wild vegetables, while gender had no influence. The following six species were rated highest in the priority setting: Bauhinia variegata L., Dendrocalamus hamiltonii Nees & Arn. ex Munro, Bambusa tulda Roxb., Diplazium esculentum (Retz.) Sw., Dryopteris cochleata (Ham. ex D. Don) C. Chr., and Tectaria gemmifera (F,e) Alston. The developed priority setting approach was considered suitable, but it should also include further variables such as nutritional value and market potential of the species before it being recommended for further testing.

AB  - Since September 2000, when world leaders agreed on time-bound, measurable goals to reduce extreme poverty, hunger, illiteracy, and disease while fostering gender equality and ensuring environmental sustainability, the Milennium Development goals (MDGs) have increasingly come to dominate the policy objectives of many states and development agencies. The concern has been raised that the tight time frame and financial restrictions might force governments to invest in the more productive sectors, thus comprimising the quality and sustainability of development efforts. In the long term, this may lead to even greater inequality, especially between geographical regions and social strata. Hence people living marginal areas, for example in remote mountain regions and minority peoples risk being disadvantaged by this internationally agreed agenda. Strategies to over come hunger and poverty in their different dimensions in mountain areas need to focus on strengthening the economy of small-scale farmers, while also fostering the sustainable use of natural resources, taking into consideration their multifunctionality.

AB  - Innovative water governance practices are essential to achieve sustainable cities through robust public policies and stakeholder engagement. This study assessed the dynamics of water service delivery in Gweru and its impact on household food security. The study focused on the city's food sources, water service pricing, power struggles in decision-making, and the implications for household food security. A household survey was conducted with 489 respondents selected by stratified random sampling. Interviews with purposively enrolled key informants and observations were also used. Findings revealed a multi-faceted scenario of water governance challenges that crippled household food security. Food purchases and farming, the primary household food streams for the city, were under threat due to water shortages and high monthly water bills. More than 90% of household incomes were below the Poverty Datum Line and the Total Consumption Poverty Line; water bills accounted for a significant portion, ultimately causing food insecurity. The grant-aided municipality emphasized revenue collection to mitigate the central government's 2013 debt cancellation. Gweru had no useful alternative sources of water for agriculture. The existing water governance failed to capture the complex symbiotic relationship between the city's water and food availability. While we advocate minimal central government interference, the municipality must introduce an efficient dual-purpose water system to protect residents, the natural environment, and the local authority's finances.

AB  - Smart Farming is a development that emphasizes the use of information and communication technology in the cyber-physical farm management cycle. New technologies such as the Internet of Things and Cloud Computing are expected to leverage this development and introduce more robots and artificial intelligence in farming. This is encompassed by the phenomenon of Big Data, massive volumes of data with a wide variety that can be captured, analysed and used for decision-making. This review aims to gain insight into the state-of-the-art of Big Data applications in Smart Farming and identify the related socio-economic challenges to be addressed. Following a structured approach, a conceptual framework for analysis was developed that can also be used for future studies on this topic. The review shows that the scope of Big Data applications in Smart Farming goes beyond primary production; it is influencing the entire food supply chain. Big data are being used to provide predictive insights in farming operations, drive real-time operational decisions, and redesign business processes for game-changing business models. Several authors therefore suggest that Big Data will cause major shifts in roles and power relations among different players in current food supply chain networks. The landscape of stake-holders exhibits an interesting game between powerful tech companies, venture capitalists and often small start-ups and new entrants. At the same time there are several public institutions that publish open data, under the condition that the privacy of persons must be guaranteed. The future of Smart Farming may unravel in a continuum of two extreme scenarios: 1) closed, proprietary systems in which the farmer is part of a highly integrated food supply chain or 2) open, collaborative systems in which the farmer and every other stakeholder in the chain network is flexible in choosing business partners as well for the technology as for the food production side. The further development of data and application infrastructures (platforms and standards) and their institutional embedment will play a crucial role in the battle between these scenarios. From a socio-economic perspective, the authors propose to give research priority to organizational issues concerning governance issues and suitable business models for data sharing in different supply chain scenarios.

AB  - Climate change and the projected depletion of fossil energy resources pose multiple global challenges. Innovative technologies offer interesting possibilities to achieve more sustainable outcomes in the energy production sector. Local, decentralized alternatives have the potential to sustain livelihoods in rural areas. One example of such a venture has emerged around heating businesses in rural Finland, and is referred to as heat entrepreneurship. Heat entrepreneurship entails a system where a local forest owner, usually a farmer, provides heat to a small community or local building, such as a school. Heat is produced using local forest resources that would otherwise be unutilized. The purpose of this study is to examine heat entrepreneurship as a potential sustainable alternative for energy production and its multifunctionality. The data was collected by interviewing 15 heat entrepreneurs in the area of Central Finland. The study demonstrates how multifunctional farming-related energy production can provide more sustainable livelihoods for farmers by increasing social, economic and environmental sustainability. This is achieved by diversifying farmers' economic options, enhancing rural areas economically, increasing farmers' social networks and well-being and, to some extent, by boosting local environmental capital. However, the study also points to differences among the farmers and sustainability trade-offs, suggesting for the need to better acknowledge the local perceptions in policy-making.

AB  - Low-carbon cropland use is of significant importance in addressing global warming. Most research has paid attention to measuring cropland use efficiency under carbon emission constraints to reconcile carbon mitigation and food security. However, there are limitations with carbon accounting, approach selection, and subsequent regression. To extend existing research, this study aimed to evaluate the performance of cropland low-carbon use (PCW) and determine the driving factors. In this study, carbon emissions and sequestration of cropland use in Chinese provinces from 2000 to 2019 were calculated. Based on the carbon accounting, an extended slack-based efficiency measurement was applied to evaluate the provincial PCLU. Besides, spatiotemporal characteristics of the PCLU were portrayed. Owing to spatial correlation, the spatial Durbin model was employed to elucidate the driving factors. The results indicate that: (1) cropland use systems acted as net carbon sinks in China with sequestration and emissions of 5.624 t/hm(2) and 1.980 t/hm(2), respectively. (2) In China, the average PCLU was 0.727, whereas the provinces had values ranging from 0.2-1.2, with significant gaps. (3) PCLU evolved stably in northeastern China and fluctuated in the other three regions. Meanwhile, provinces with high PCLU shifted from the south to the north of the country during the study period. The global Moran's index demonstrated that a positive spatial correlation existed. (4) Agricultural structure adjustment and urbanization can promote PCW, whereas investment and disaster can undermine it. PCLU of a province would be affected by the agricultural structure and disaster in its nearby provinces owing to spillover effects. Consequently, it is suggested that emissions in provinces should be mitigated according to the local carbon structure. Harnessing the key factors and spatial interactions can potentially help achieve regional low-carbon cropland use. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (OC) sequestration in farmlands can be improved through fertilizer applications, particularly with the addition of organic amendments. However, our knowledge of the effects of long-term different fertilization on OC chemical stability and carbon management index (CMI), as well as their response to crop productivity remains limited in rice-rice cropping system. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of fertilization on various OC sequestration indicators in bulk soil and chemical fractions, and establish their relationships with crop productivity. The treatments selected in the present study were those which had undergone long-term fertilization under double-rice cropping including: (1) no fertilization (CK); (2) combined application of chemical nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium fertilizers (NPK); (3) the doubled rate of NPK treatment (2NPK); and (4) NPK treatment plus organic fertilizers (NPKM). After 29 years of fertilization, we observed that NPKM resulted in the highest OC stocks (11.47 and 26.15 Mg ha(-1), respectively) and distribution ratios (24 and 54%, respectively) in the less-labile fraction and passive pool. Conversely, it showed the lowest OC values in the labile fraction and active pool compared to CK, NPK, and 2NPK treatments. Additionally, NPKM significantly (P < 0.05) increased CMI (by 47 and 33%) over CK and NPK treatments, which suggests that soil receiving NPKM was better managed. Apart from maintaining higher crop yields and increasing OC input, NPKM also tremendously enhanced OC sequestration as indicated by the highest soil OC stock (48.80 Mg ha(-1)) and OC sequestration rate (CSR, 0.37 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)). There was an increasing trend of CSR and passive OC pool, but a decreasing trend of carbon sequestration efficiency with increasing OC input, which may be associated with OC saturation behavior of soil. Furthermore, crop yield showed significant positive linear correlations with passive OC pool and CMI. In summary, long-term combined application of chemical and organic fertilizers enhanced OC sequestration and crop productivity by improving passive OC pool and CMI, which contributed to realize agricultural sustainability in double-cropping rice regions.

AB  - The availability and distribution of biomass resources are important for the development of the bioenergy industry in a region. Biomass resources are abundant in China; however, the raw material is severely deficient, which makes the Chinese bioenergy industry an embarrassment and a contradiction. Unclear reserves and distribution and changing trends of biomass resources are the reason for this situation. A collection coefficient model of Chinese agricultural residue resources was established and the spatial and temporal pattern dynamics of agricultural residue resources in the last 30 years were analyzed. The results show that agricultural residue resources increased in stages from 1978 to 2011, including a rapid increase from 1978 to 1999, a significant fall from 2000 to 2004, and a slow increase from 2004 to 2011. Crops straw and livestock manure are the main ingredients of agricultural residue resources with proportions of 53-59% and 31-38%, respectively. However, the former has gradually decreased, while the latter is increasing. This mainly resulted from the strategic reorganization of the Chinese agriculture structure and the rapid development of large-scale livestock breeding and agricultural mechanization. Large regional differences existed in Chinese agricultural residue resources, and three distribution types formed, including resource-rich areas in North China, Northeast and Inner Mongolia, resource-limited areas in Central and Southwest China, and resource-poor areas along Northwest and Southeast coasts. This pattern is a reverse of the distributions of climatic conditions, water resources, economic development, human resources, and technological levels. Finally, it can be predicted that livestock manure and biomass conversion technology at low temperature will play increasingly significant roles in bioenergy industry development.

AB  - Deforestation and forest degradation are major drivers of global environmental change and tropical forests are subjected to unprecedented pressures from both. For most tropical zones, deforestation rates are averaged across entire countries, often without highlighting regional differentiation. There are also very few estimates of forest degradation, either averaged or localized for the tropics. We quantified regional and country-wide changes in deforestation and forest degradation rates for Madagascar from Landsat temporal data (in two intervals, 1994-2002 and 2002-2014). To our knowledge, this is the first country-wide estimate of forest degradation for Madagascar. We also performed an intensity analysis to categorize the magnitude and speed of transitions between forest, vegetation matrix, cultivated land and exposed surface. We found significant regional heterogeneity in deforestation and forest degradation. Deforestation rates decreased annually in lowland evergreen moist forest by -0.24% and in all other vegetation zones. Forest degradation rates had annual increases in the same period in lowland evergreen moist forest (0.09%), littoral forest (0.06%) but decreased in medium altitude moist evergreen forest (-0.25%), dry deciduous forest (-0.23%) and scelrophyllous woodland (-0.61%) in the same period. Despite these regional differences, higher rates of deforestation and forest degradation were consistently driven by rapid and large-sized conversions of largely intact forest to cultivated lands and exposed surfaces, most of which occurred between 1994 and 2002. These results suggest that while targeted conservation projects may have reduced forest degradation rates in some areas (e.g. medium altitude moist evergreen forest), the drivers of land cover change remain intense in relatively neglected regions. We advocate a more balanced approach to future conservation initiatives, one recognizing that deforestation and forest degradation, particularly in tropical Africa, are often driven by region-specific conditions and therefore require conservation policies tailored for local conditions.

AB  - Agriculture faces unique challenges as increasing world population places unprecedented demands on food, feed, and energy resources. In an effort to become more efficient and sustainable, marginal land, including regulatory brownfields prohibited for food consumption purposes could be utilized for bioenergy crop production. In 2006-2008, we evaluated soybean (Glycine Max (L.) Merr.), canola (Brassica napus L. var. napus), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) to determine crop suitability for bioenergy production on a regulatory brownfield site. Sites selected for the study included a remediated brownfield site in Rose Township, Oakland County, and a historically cropped agricultural site at East Lansing, Ingham County, serving as the control. Comparisons of biofuel quality components were conducted. The total oil yield of oilseed crops was not significantly different ( p < 0.05) between locations. Concentrations of palmitic (C16:0), stearic (C18:0), oleic (C18:1), linoleic (C18:2), and linolenic (C18:3) fatty acids differed by location, yet oleic acid concentrations, optimal for quality biodiesel production, were not significantly different across all oilseed crops. Total crystalline cellulose levels from switchgrass were higher at the agricultural land site compared to the brownfield site in 2007 yielding 16% more crystalline cellulose; but there were no differences between locations in 2008. Detectable levels of PCB's were found in soils at the brownfield site; however, transfer to grain or biomass was not detected. Results suggest that brownfield sites have the potential to produce feedstock of suitable quality for conversion to liquid transportation fuels. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Environmental sustainability has become the focus of agricultural sustainability. This study is aimed at evaluating the environmental sustainability of farmers' land use decisions on saline-alkaline soil in China. Based on empirical and theoretical approaches, the decisions mainly include planting, crop distribution, irrigation, drainage, and fertilization. By surveying 22 administrative villages in typical ecologically fragile saline-alkaline areas of five regions (Shandong, Jiangsu, Jilin, Ningxia, and Xinjiang), the paper builds the evaluation criteria at village level, and obtains a comprehensive index. From the results, irrigation concerns are absent from decision-making. For other decisions, farmers in most villages can appropriately deal with planting, drainage, and fertilization according to the regional natural and social geography conditions. But the comprehensive index of crop distribution in the coastal areas is much stronger than in the northeast and northwest. It is found that the similarities of unsustainability lie in the planting of water-consuming crops, the arbitrary distribution of crops, lack of drainage planning, obsolete water conservancy facilities, excessive use of chemical fertilizers, etc. According to the research, on the one hand, it can guide farmers to rationally make use of saline-alkaline land; on the other hand, it can also provide the basis for government to make differentiated policies in different areas and enhance pertinence in the course of technological extension and application.

AB  - Facing the dual challenges of limited natural resources, particularly water, and increasing demands for food security, the role of precision agriculture has become increasingly critical, especially in resource-constrained environments of developing countries. Since its inception in the mid-1980s, precision agriculture in the United States and Europe has evolved to integrate advanced technologies to optimize resource use and minimize environmental impacts, yet it remains in its nascent stages in major developing countries despite attempts at precision irrigation practices. This paper reviews the evolution of soil moisture monitoring technologies from 2013 to 2024, analyzing their strengths, weaknesses, and accuracy in various soil depths to guide modern practices in water and irrigation management within precision agriculture. Highlighting the shift from traditional methods to innovative on-the-go sensors, including electrical, optical, and radiometric sensors, as well as the deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), satellite remote sensing (RS), and IoT-based systems and wireless sensor networks (WSNs), these technologies provide timely, cost-effective, and detailed soil moisture data, significantly enhancing irrigation precision. Our analysis not only showcases technological advancements but also identifies current research gaps, proposing the integration of these technologies to enhance soil moisture management and support sustainable, high-yield agriculture. The anticipated benefits of this integration include improved soil health, increased crop yields, and more effective utilization of water resources, crucial for the sustainability of agriculture in developing nations. By bridging the research-practice gap, this paper aims to foster the adoption of these technologies in precision agriculture, addressing specific agricultural challenges in water-limited settings.

AB  - Understanding the acceptance and views of small-scale fishers regarding the summer fishing moratorium (SFM) is essential for the sustainability of marine fishery resources and social development of traditional fishing areas in China. This study explored the acceptance and impact of the SFM from the perspective of small-scale fishers, reviewed the existing literature on policy acceptance, and developed a research framework for evaluating their acceptance of the marine SFM. In addition, this study identified factors affecting policy acceptance, including policy awareness, law enforcement effectiveness, resource protection effects, and livelihood impacts. A total of 325 valid questionnaires were collected from small-scale fishers in four towns around the Beibu Gulf. The results revealed that respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the positive long-term impact of the SFM. However, they acknowledged that the SFM affected their livelihoods to varying degrees. Most fishers believed that stricter enforcement of the policy was necessary and that violations to the rules must be strongly punishable, leading to a high overall acceptance of the policy. Policy acceptance was positively affected by awareness, effective implementation, and perceived resource protection but negatively affected by livelihood impacts. These results highlight the need to formulate balanced policy measures that consider both resource protection and the economic well-being of small-scale fishers. The study recommends strengthening policy implementation, improving communication strategies, and providing targeted financial support to mitigate negative livelihood impacts, thereby fostering greater acceptance of sustainable fishery management.

AB  - Pig sector in China is faced with high risks, such as price fluctuation and food safety, and environmental regulation uncertainty. The recent African swine fever has caused public panic and drop down of pork consumption in a short term. The "wu-shui-gong-zhi" policy is a newly recognized environmental policy risk, and its key content is to shut down directly the pig farms close to water resources. Lots of small- and medium-sized farms have been affected, especially in coastal provinces. Supply chain integration received wide attention in supply chain management. Literature has shown that a well-coordinated food supply chain will bring positive outcomes for chain stakeholders. However, the relationship between food supply chain integration and resilience is not empirically captured. This research aims to explore the relationship between supply chain integration and supply chain resilience, and the mechanism of how supply chain integration works on supply chain resilience. To achieve the research purpose, an in-depth ethnographical case study is performed. Four cases in China's pig sector were selected, with different types of supply chain integration between cooperative and companies. They differ in supply chain resilience levels. We found that supply chain integration has a positive effect on supply chain resilience through agility and robustness. Supply chain agility also has positive relationship with supply chain robustness. It implies that supply chain stakeholders should efficiently exchange information, enhance circulation rate, and jointly make plans to be more resilient to risks. The government needs to make policies to encourage and facilitate supply chain integration among supply chain members to enhance supply chain resilience.

AB  - Arctic Indigenous food systems are typified by diverse social interactions that maintain food security. Given the numerous challenges Arctic Indigenous communities face, it is important to understand diversity in these systems and how they are impacted by change. This study adopts a mixed methods approach that combines participatory methods with network analysis to assess the diversity of food-related interactions between different actor types in the mixed food system on St. Paul Island, Alaska. We conducted 36 interviews with local food system actors to identify current food security challenges and food-related interactions in the local food system. We used network analysis to investigate the diversity of interactions in the food system quantitatively. We simulated the effects of two key food security challenges (out-migration and knowledge loss) on food system diversity and explored interventions to increase diversity. Qualitative data from the same interviews were used to embed our results in the lived realities of the St. Paul Island community. Our approach reveals diverse interactions in the local food system, reflecting both subsistence and market-based elements of the St. Paul Island mixed economy. While both challenges threaten the system's diversity, out-migration presents a more immediate risk to food system diversity than knowledge loss. We advocate for targeting a combination of food system interventions at the community level to enhance food system diversity effectively. Our research contributes to understanding the importance of diversity for Arctic Indigenous food security and emphasizes the need to recognize the complex interactions between food system interventions and their implications for Arctic Indigenous communities.
