AB  - A persistent challenge to deliver a socially just and ecologically sustainable development for emerging cities in non-Western countries is that legitimacy and effectiveness often hinge on the normalizing effect of international 'models' and 'standards' defined by the developed countries. In cases such as Shanghai's latest urban sustainability programme, a fixation on excelling at 'global indicators' has led its promises of inclusive social progress astray. We argue this is not simply because Shanghai authorities didn't 'get' just sustainability, but highlights a more rooted subaltern anxiety that constrains their perceptions on how their programmes should be identified and delivered. Drawing on Bourdieu's theorization of how social agency's 'logic of practice' is connected to their positions in the 'field', we investigate a shared epistemic deference among Shanghai experts and publics toward knowledge generated from international experiences. This has reproduced a marginalization of the subaltern public in the field of developing sustainable cities.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to critically analyse so-called 'successful' low-carbon energy transitions under the energy justice magnifying glass. We focus on two case studies that have been arguably referred to as successful local energy transitions in the literature: Samso (Denmark) and Feldheim (Germany). The study examines community perspectives and causal inferences about perceived energy (in)justice during the transition to a low-carbon local energy system. Theories of justice and process tracing form the core of our methodological approach. We identify and examine evidence in relation to four main areas: consultation processes, information flow/sharing, decision making and outcomes. The findings reveal that the transition processes were triggered by a multi-dimensional crisis in a unique context, and highlight the role of procedural justice in the investigated areas. Multiple tensions and conflicts were identified (notably concerning the location and ownership of wind turbines). However, and strongly driven by local, bottom-up, intensive information and consultation processes, evidence of perceived procedural Justice was found in both cases. With regard to distributive justice, communities perceived the outcomes of the transition as beneficial to some groups, particularly from the point of view of benefits for individuals. Perceived energy justice was more positive if social and environmental outcomes were considered, including the implementation of compensation schemes. However, a quantitative analysis is required to qualify these assertions. With due limitations, we conclude that the perceived fairness of procedures, as identified in both cases, seemed to be a critical pre-condition for the perceived legitimacy of outcomes.

AB  - In this chapter, we set out a strategy for urban densification, which we name Greenspace-Oriented Development (GOD). While Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) co-locates urban densification with public transport hubs, GOD colocates urban densification with significant, upgraded public green spaces (such as parks) that are relatively well served by public transport. The upgraded parks, and their connecting streetscapes, operate as a multifunctional, communal "backyard" for residents living in a surrounding higher-density urban precinct. Through GOD, we propose to weave together the positive aspects of suburbia (i.e. access to open space and nature) with those of good quality medium-density urban infill (i.e. access to public transport, facilities and good urban design). In this chapter, we describe GOD, its key principles, benefits and the settings to which it is most suited.

AB  - To achieve the goal of stabilizing carbon dioxide at acceptable levels under the Paris agreement, it is essential to control carbon emissions by implementing regulatory interventions. Carbon tax and emission trading system (ETS) are two effective tools to regulate carbon emissions. Various studies have investigated both methods, yet few have considered the impact of these two policies on the electricity market and social welfare. The purpose of this paper is to fill in the gap, namely to quantify the influence of the carbon tax and ETS using the baseline-and-credit method on the electricity market. In addition, an optimal hybrid policy that combines both carbon tax and ETS is developed. Our case studies demonstrate that carbon tax, ETS, and the hybrid carbon policy can achieve the goal of reducing carbon emission and increasing social welfare. For hybrid policy, the carbon tax rate and the emission marginal cost of allowance in ETS are optimized properly to maximize social welfare.

AB  - Transitions to low-carbon energy systems are essential to mitigating and adapting to climate change. Energy storage systems are a key component in achieving a viable decarbonized electric grid. However, decarbonization alone does not guarantee a fairer, more inclusive, or socially just energy system. Energy equity and justice should be integrated in energy system transitions to ensure benefits and burdens are shared equitably. In this paper, we discuss the relationship between energy storage and social equity by assessing the use of energy storage to replace natural gas-fired (NG) peaker plants. Peaker plants are disproportionately located near disadvantaged communities and tend to be older and high emitters of health-affecting fine particulate matter and other pollutants. This paper investigates the equity implications of NG peaker plant replacements with battery energy storage in the context of Washington State's peaker plants to highlight the human-centered values of retiring the plants. The study performed production cost simulations using the latest Western Electric Coordinating Council Anchor Dataset 2030 case and found that total generation cost, locational marginal price, and total annual emissions were reduced with the replacements. These reductions will have equity benefits on local communities including access to clean air, enhanced health outcomes, and energy burden reductions.

AB  - Urban expansion threatens ecosystems, biodiversity, and public health. Green infrastructure helps promote biodiversity and improve air and water quality, and public health benefits. This study aimed to develop a geospatial model to support decision-making on identifying priority areas for increasing green infrastructure to maintain biodiversity in urban landscapes, focusing on the Atlantic Forest Biome. The model was based on Multicriteria Analysis and a mixed approach to define the criteria, integrating literature review and participatory techniques. Using the Weighted Linear Combination, the model classified areas into low, medium, and high priorities based on four criteria: landscape connectivity, proximity to Protected Areas, rivers and lakes, and distances from streets and roads. The high-priority areas were identified as the most suitable for implementing new green infrastructure. Results provide insights for urban managers seeking to expand green networks and biodiversity-driven infrastructure, transforming urban areas into resilient ecosystems addressing the challenges posed by climate change.

AB  - To achieve their normative health, environmental and social objectives, water and sanitation services must be safely managed, inclusive and climate resilient. Meeting these imperatives presents a need and opportunity for innovative thinking about water and sanitation service systems. Circular economy concepts are being applied across a multitude of product and service sectors with the aim to facilitate regenerative flows of resources. Given the dependence on water resources, associated climate risks, and the generation of reusable waste products in water and sanitation service delivery, circular economy concepts can be usefully leveraged to drive sustainability outcomes. This article contributes a heuristic in the form of a conceptual framework for applying circular economy concepts in the design and delivery of water and sanitation services in diverse Global South contexts. The framework seeks to drive multiple outcomes relevant to water and sanitation initiatives: safely managed services, social inclusion, and climate resilience. Co-developed by an international research team applying a theoretical multiplicity approach and collaborative sensemaking, the heuristic takes the form of a suite of eight adapted circular economy 'R strategies' for water and sanitation. The R strategies were selected and articulated to reflect theory-based principles of circular economy, climate resilience and inclusion. They are intended to prompt thinking and action in pursuit of safely managed, climate resilient, inclusive water and sanitation services that align with the broader sustainability directions that circular economy narratives aspire to. The heuristic offers a conceptually rigorous, practical tool that can support collaborative, deliberative processes to realise the potential benefits of circularity in water and sanitation service systems.

Population growth and urban sprawl were found as the most important factors determining soil sealing, land consumption, biodiversity decline and loss in natural resources. The multifaceted interactions observed between socioeconomic and biophysical factors were also highlighted. The study discusses an integrated set of measures as a policy instrument for sustainable land management of Mediterranean peri-urban areas.

AB  - Purpose - The objective of this chapter is to draw the attention of policy makers in the fields of urban planning and transport in China to the importance of developing more balanced multi-modal transport systems and the corresponding land-use patterns to support transport systems, particularly walking and cycling in order to address the issues arising from the dense, highly mixed land-use pattern in many Chinese cities. This will help to reverse current planning practices which give car-oriented development top priority and less consideration of walking and cycling. Methodology - Statistical methods have been applied to analyse modal split in some cities in Japan, Beijing and Shanghai using travel surveys, plus analysis of the experience of policies in various cities around the world, especially in terms of the relationship between the modal shares for public transport and car. Door-to-door travel times have been analysed for Shanghai to understand the potential of cycle or e-bicycle in a dense urban environment. Findings - The change in travel modal split in Beijing in recent years suggests that simply encouraging public transport cannot control use of car. The data from Japan also shows that normal bus services cannot compete with the car, but it is clear that people will travel less by car if there is a high non-motorized share in the city. Because of the low density of the metro network, the door-to-door travel speed by metro is not as fast as is often imagined, due to the long off-metro time. The people who use metro are often not the people who live very close to metro stations, but some distance away, so improving the connection to the station by cycle or e-bicycle could greatly reduce the total travel time by metro. Research limitations and implications - More analyses should be conducted in medium-size and small-size cities in China, where the local capacity is low and there is great potential to travel by walking and cycling, but only after clear guidance and policy instruments have been provided by higher authorities. Practical and social implications - There is still a relatively high share of non-motorized travel in China. Many cities still have extensive cycle infrastructure established under the State Code of Urban Road Transport Planning issued in 1995. Encouraging non-motorized transport systems is not only possible, but also good for the environment, and contributes to travel efficiency and social inclusion. Originality - This chapter is the summary of several original research studies using primary survey data, encouraging public transport in China. This is the first research to show the great potential of non-motorized mode for controlling car use and improving urban mobility in China. It is also the first chapter to point out the integration of multi-modal transport systems with the corresponding built environment in China.

AB  - Despite the increasing use of neighbourhood sustainability assessment tools (NSAT), their linear approach may be insufficient to tackle the global and local social and ecological challenges. The circular economy (CE) has recently emerged as a new pathway, adopted by corporations and public organisations. Understanding how to apply CE to existing communities, while addressing some of its shortcomings, particularly the strong focus on resource management, is the main goal of this paper. Building upon a Regenerative Circularity for the Built Environment (RC4BE) conceptual model that merges circular economy and regenerative design concepts, a framework with criteria for its implementation in the transition of existing urban areas is proposed. A preliminary framework structure with criteria mapped from literature is proposed and validated through a 2-round Delphi consultation with 31 international experts. The final framework, with 136 criteria, addresses some of the identified gaps and different urban cycles related to physical resources, ecosystems, liveability, infrastructure, governance, participation, local economy, and other socioeconomic aspects of urban communities. This expanded take on CE should be useful for built environment professionals and other urban stakeholders interested in regenerating their communities and precincts by going beyond current green approaches and existing tools to effectively generate positive impact for people and the planet.

AB  - Green stormwater infrastructure has been demonstrated as an innovative water resources management approach that addresses multiple challenges facing urban environments. However, there is little consensus on what policy strategies can be used to best incentivize green infrastructure adoption by private landowners. Game theory, an analysis framework that has historically been under-utilized within the context of stormwater management, is uniquely suited to address this policy question. We used a cooperative game theory framework to investigate the potential impacts of different policy strategies used to incentivize green infrastructure installation. The results indicate that municipal regulation leads to the greatest reduction in pollutant loading. However, the choice of the "best" regulatory approach will depend on a variety of different factors including politics and financial considerations. Large, downstream agents have a disproportionate share of bargaining power. Results also reveal that policy impacts are highly dependent on agents' spatial position within the stormwater network, leading to important questions of social equity and environmental justice.

AB  - In response to the adverse consequences of urbanisation, including the production of over 70% of global emissions and the increase in social inequalities, cities have set ambitious missions to devise a set of innovative solutions in their transition to a circular economy. This exploratory research examines the conditions that should be met for such missions to trigger the development of an innovative system that could support cities in such a transition. While several studies have been conducted on the narrative of the circular economy as a 'way of doing', this article adopts the circular economy as a 'way of thinking'. To further explore the conceptual diversity of the circular economy, this article uses rapid ethnography as a method in the context of a Dutch region by pursuing a circular mission. The results highlight that a mission alone is not enough to create an innovative and inclusive system as the underlying narrative lacks congruence; this, thus, suggests that the circular economy may not be the most compelling narrative for the mission of cities toward a more sustainable development.

AB  - There is potential in applying the circular economy (CE) and regenerative design (RD) models for the redevelopment of urban areas as a response to the current linear and mechanistic practices that still contribute to exceeding planetary boundaries and reinforcing social inequalities. Despite these models' common roots, they are usually approached quite differently. A merged approach may be able to solve existing gaps and critiques. This paper reviews relevant CE and RD definitions linked to the urban context. An inductive content analysis to map and discuss existing themes is conducted, leading to a set of five underpinning pillars. The resulting 'Regenerative Circularity for the Built Environment' conceptual model adopts a systemic and positive impact approach that is the steppingstone for the development of a practical tool aiming to support urban stakeholders in the transition of existing neighbourhoods with strategies more suitable to their aims and notion of place.

AB  - This paper implements a framework that catalogs and maps opportunities at a city level to support the electrification of the transportation system in an equitable way. Leveraging on the use of hyper-local air quality data, paired with sociodemographic indicators, we evaluate the framework in the City of Oakland, CA under a context of public and private transport areas to prioritize interventions and incentives, while reducing environmental hazard exposure under an equity focus. Following the recognition of racial and socio-economic disparities, the subsequent steps of implementing operational strategies are to identify specific bus routes in the city in which decarbonization would render the highest impact with respect to the distribution of environmental burden, and to identify regions in which private vehicle interventions would render the highest impact with respect to racial and social equity and mobility.

AB  - The Paris Agreement and SDG13 on Climate Action require a global drop in Green House Gases (GHG) emissions to stay within a "well below 2 degrees" climate change trajectory. Cities will play a key role in achieving this, being responsible for 60 to 80% of the global GHG emissions depending on the estimate. This paper describes how Research and Innovation (R&I) can play a key role in decarbonizing European cities, and the role that research and education institutions can play in that regard. The paper highlights critical R&I actions in cities based on three pillars: (1) innovative technology and integration, (2) governance innovation, and (3) social innovation. Further, the research needed to harmonize climate mitigation and adaptation in cities are investigated.

AB  - Building energy consumption has increased rapidly in the past decade, in particular for heat demand and electric vehicles, owning to the development of economy and improvement of living standard. Distributed Energy Systems (DESs), which can effectively improve the share of renewable energy in the energy mix, lower the energy cost and reduce environmental impact, is a promising approach to meet the increased energy demand. This paper presents a review of the system architecture of DESs for building decarbonization, including hybrid energy systems, en-ergy storage technologies, building flexible loads, and electric vehicles. The uncertainties from both the environment and human interventions challenge the energy management due to the asynchrony between energy generation and energy consumption. Thus, the system should be optimally designed and operated to enhance the reliability, affordability, and flexibility of the DES. The paper highlights the adoption of optimization approaches. Finally, future trends and challenges are discussed. It is concluded that the digital transformation featured with IoT, AI, advanced machine learning, sophisticated optimization approaches, and Blockchain is the enabler for future smart cities.

AB  - Sustainability programs and their assessments have often been criticized for failing to support social justice. Eco-city development has also raised similar concerns. This research was conducted in order to address such problems. Specifically, this paper develops a new sustainability index that emphasizes environmental justice for the purpose of better classifying and assessing eco-cities. The proposed index measures equity among places as a result of eco-city development. Specifically, this index indicates instances in which a certain location achieves sustainability through means detrimental to another location. Thus, the index, comprised of environmental, economic, and social indicators of sustainability, may also be used to foster justice among diverse locations (urban centers, suburbs, rural areas, and neighboring cities) by highlighting the genuine motives behind eco-city development. One preliminary finding from the application of this classification is that oftentimes, eco-city development is not completed in the environmental, economic, or social interests of the people. Official eco-cities tend to serve government officials' interest in upper mobility. Developer eco-cities tend to be commercial expansions or developments focused on growth, profit, and model demonstration. Both official and developer eco-cities degrade the environment. They are also likely to develop urban centers at the environmental expense of other places. The economic growth of official and developer eco-cities is accompanied by worsening income inequality and social injustice. As a result, these types of eco-cities fail the sustainability performance assessment. Conversely, eco-cities founded by the citizens or by donors tend to focus on social and economic equity. This study was completed using qualitative research methods, including field work in 29 eco-cities throughout China and various countries. This field work was conducted from 2006 to 2014. Data was collected through interviews with 87 government officials, as well as environmental experts, grassroots environmentalists, residents, and real estate developers. The findings reveal that the majority of Chinese eco-cities have been overlooked in global eco-city literature. The research also calls for effective sustainability management in order to avoid the development of eco-cities that negatively impact the environmental and social interests of surrounding areas.

AB  - Citizen Science (CS) has been useful in research development and policymaking, where laypeople contribute to collecting and/or analyzing data. With the technological advancement of smart cities and data analysis techniques, CS helps foster efficient/sustainable cities and data-driven decision-making. However, more effort is needed to make CS more accessible for urban scholars and practitioners. Thus, we provided a comprehensive overview of CS in Urban Studies and Regional Urban Planning (USRUP) by revealing the main thematic/method approaches, stakeholder roles, socioeconomic/environmental/policy impacts, limitations, best practices, and cases. Thus, we performed a Systematic Literature Review on CS in USRUP using the PRISMA Guidelines of 94 studies collected from the Web of Science Core Collection, published by 2023. Our key findings underscore the practical uses of diverse methodologies and approaches employed in CS projects, emphasizing their potential to enhance urban research and policymaking. The core socioeconomic impacts of CS projects are fostering community empowerment, engagement, and educational opportunities. The main environmental impacts are enhancing monitoring capabilities, improving ecosystem service assessments, and supporting adaptive management practices. As for urban planning and policies, CS projects can foster data-driven planning, urban sustainability, urban resilience, healthier cities, and social equity. CS challenges include data quality and consistency, the digital divide, and the need for sustained funding. Best practices have included clear communication, standardized protocols, and strong community engagement. Further developments should involve citizens in more analytical roles (rather than merely instrumental ones, like data collection) in CS projects and explore CS in social urbanism for transforming vulnerable communities.

AB  - Land use, transport, and energy-environment integration (LUTEI) is receiving considerable attention as an elaborate approach to improving urban resilience. Research evidence on this multidisciplinary topic tends to be fragmented, hindering constructive analysis of its role in shaping sustainable cities. This paper addresses this by undertaking a holistic systematic review to consolidate diverse perspectives. The analysis of 195 reviewed papers identified four main clusters of knowledge that include methodological approaches, policy instruments, urban design elements, and impacts of interventions. The analysis revealed that a growing body of literature is increasingly focused on improving accessibility planning, transit-oriented development, and policy integration to achieve sustainable and healthy transport as a vital element of resilience in cities. The review found, however, that the integration of environment and energy into land use and transport models is still at a nascent stage of development and has largely been overlooked in traditional LUTI models. This can lead to unreliable assessments of the impacts of low-carbon mobility solutions, emerging green transport technologies, and long-term changes in energy consumption affecting sustainable mobility futures. This paper concludes by connecting LUTEI dimensions to the UN's sustainable development goals (SDG), outlining future directions to ignite meaningful research on the topic and providing a transparent path for decision-makers to adopt LUTEI-informed planning.

AB  - Urban landscapes can be transformed by widespread abandonment from population and economic decline. Ecological assembly, sometimes referred to as greening, following abandonment can yield valuable ecosystem services, but also can pose a risk to public health. Abandonment can elevate zoonotic vector-borne disease risk by favoring the hyperabundance of commensal pests and pathogen vectors. Though greater biodiversity in abandoned areas can potentially dilute vector-borne pathogen transmission, greening can elevate transmission risk by increasing movement of pathogen vectors between fragmented areas and by giving rise to novel human-wildlife interfaces. Idled and derelict infrastructure can further elevate disease risk from vector-borne and water-borne pathogens, which can build up in stagnant and unprotected water that maintenance and routine use of delivery or sanitation systems would otherwise eliminate. Thus, framing greening as inherently positive could result in policies and actions that unintentionally exacerbate inequalities by elevating risks rather than delivering benefits. As counter-urbanism is neither a minor pattern of urban development, nor a short-term departure from urban growth, homeowner and municipal management of abandoned areas should account for potential hazards to reduce health risks. Further socioecological assessments of public health risks following abandonment could better ensure the resilience and well-being of communities in shrinking cities.

AB  - Neighborhoods encounter various challenges that span environmental, social, and economic dimensions, which threaten both the sustainability of these cities and the well-being of their residents. Presently, urban systems function within a linear and inefficient framework, particularly noticeable in critical sectors such as food, energy, and water. This highlights the critical need to shift towards incorporating Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) within urban neighborhoods. Implementing NBS faces challenges such as financial constraints, land scarcity, lack of technical expertise, limited community buy-in, and maintenance issues. The integration of NBS can enhance the socio-economic resilience of the city on three scales: building, street, and neighborhood. By focusing on multifunctionality, these solutions address multiple issues simultaneously, such as improving insulation, enhancing urban biodiversity, managing stormwater, and reducing the urban heat island effect. The research investigates the potential of NBS to facilitate sustainable neighborhood development, emphasizing economic strategies through closed-loop systems to rehabilitate damaged ecosystems, enhance biodiversity, and revitalize neglected and underutilized spaces that detract from a city's overall quality of life. A comprehensive review of existing literature has been undertaken to clarify the scalability potential of NBS within the housing sector, leading to more resilient, equitable, and livable urban environments. This research emphasizes innovative maintenance strategies to ensure the sustainability of NBS across various urban and socio-economic contexts. The review compiles recommendations for conceptualizing NBS for resilient neighborhoods while identifying an execution framework for NBS implementation in neighborhoods particularly those with low-income housing, by engaging communities to promote a sense of belonging and socio-economic resilience.

AB  - Taiwan has abundant biological resources that provide a quality living environment; however, industrial land use may change that environment through urban sprawl and thus have impacts on rural society. This study examined the experience of a Taiwanese rural region that has been exposed to industrial wastewater discharge specifying the relationship of industrial development to rural society and its role in policy. We addressed the societal adaptation to environmental degradation from risk perception perspectives about land use. Drawing on social vulnerability concept, semi-structured interviews were conducted in five communities that use irrigation water exposed to wastewater discharge. The interviews were designed using the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) causal framework to examine residents' risk perceptions highlighting both built-environmental sensitivity (degradation) and residents' adaptability (capacity). In addition, remote sensing technology was used to identify the urban sprawl that led to industrial land use and exposed the rural region to water pollution risks. As a result, we present a social resilience cycle to introduce adaptive responses underlining social amplification of risk. Both local knowledge of the locals (the Hakka people) and their societal response to environmental change reflect the role of culture in influencing land use policy. It is underlined that individual and community responses shape the social experience of risk and are related to both the ethnicity of the locals and the land use policy of the government. We indicated further that a large-scale survey that would really quantity this exploratory study to support land use decision-making is expected. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article generalizes the urbanization process and its impact on agricultural land use in Vietnam. The high rate of urbanization has led to a great demand for purchasing agricultural products, especially high-quality ones, and as a result, this affects agricultural development. On one hand, it offers new chances to expand the domestic market and to encourage exports. On the other hand, the conversion of agricultural land into non-agricultural land under accelerated urbanization leads to a large area of arable land being abandoned or polluted, consequently affecting food security and sustainable development. Therefore, to meet the people's food needs in the context of urbanization, it is necessary to have proper solutions to improve the efficiency of agricultural land use, such as: implementing land laws aimed at developing agricultural production in the direction of large-scale, concentrated commodities; executing land-use planning, performing agricultural production planning towards specialized cultivation with a stable term to ensure profitable investment; boosting the restructuring of the agricultural sector; developing collective and cooperative economics in agriculture; having policies to support, forecast, and search for markets for consumption and the processing of agricultural products; creating a transparent land-use rights market.

AB  - Around 38% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are related to buildings. In Austria, most building-related industries designed roadmaps to net zero GHG emissions by 2050. However, there is little evidence whether this will be enough to stay within the climate limits, or if a more drastic approach is needed. In this paper we investigate the potential need for sufficiency in the built environment to stay within the latest 1.5-2°C carbon budget, including expected future technological developments. We implement a set of energy and industry transition scenarios to a building stock model, including an increase in circularity, and compare the resulting carbon emissions (both operational and embodied) with the carbon budget. Results show that, even with ambitious decarbonization pathways for Austrian industry, the projected rates of construction do not allow for staying within the carbon budget. On the contrary, additional sufficiency measures such as slightly reducing the average living area per person are a great lever for reducing GHG emissions and, with carbon removal, might be the only options left to comply with the climate targets.

AB  - This paper reviews the empirical evidence on the relationships between urban patterns and various dimensions of environmental quality and performance. I first examine approaches to measuring urban environmental performance, drawing on the concepts of carrying capacity, ecological footprint, environmental space, and appropriated ecosystem area. Since cities affect and are affected by ecological systems far beyond their physical boundaries, I propose including interactions at the local, regional, and global scales in the definition of environmental performance. I then systematically review the current literature on the relationship between four structural variables typically used to describe urban patterns-form, density, grain, and connectivity-and four dimensions of environmental performance-sources, sinks, ecological support systems, and human well-being. I conclude that what we measure and the scale of analysis affect the direction of observable urban impacts. We must consider these factors as we select measures of urban environmental performance.

AB  - This paper examines whether carbon neutrality of a city like Athens could be an achievable target, concentrating on energy induced greenhouse gas emissions. The main focus is on buildings, but the trends in transport are also investigated. Taking into consideration these examined trends, emphasis is given on technologies that have been put forward for the decarbonisation of cities, such as energy savings and electrification of all energy consuming activities. The incorporation of these technologies is examined within a time frame of approximately 30 years, in order to investigate how, with which technologies and synergies the city can reach carbon neutrality by 2050, taking into account the effect of the undergoing energy crisis. In these projections, various scenarios are examined, taking into consideration not only the effect of national plans for the decarbonisation of electricity production, but also the current energy crisis, which might lead to an increase in the carbon footprint of electricity. Optimistic and pessimistic scenarios, regarding the decarbonisation of electricity, energy demand trends, energy costs that lead to the rise of energy poverty within the city are investigated. Conclusions are drawn on the synergies that must take place so that energy efficiency technologies that have been put forward can be effective for the transformation of Athenian buildings and activities into carbon neutral ones, or can lead to the failure of such a goal.

AB  - The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) sector is in need of a transition towards a circular economy. This article offers an analysis of two cases with a wide variation regarding project dynamics in the Netherlands. Alignments and misalignments were analyzed between practices concerning seven design strategies for circular design based on social practice theory and concepts from the multi-level perspective. Results show that many misalignments still hinder the transition, mostly concerning the use of secondary resources, such as notions regarding quality, beauty, and safety among project team members or rapid decision-making processes of the municipality that misalign with the uptake of design with secondary resources. This article offers directions for reconfiguration, such as better tuning between project planning and urban planning and taking up a more flexible stance regarding the function of the building. This research is interesting for practitioners and researchers focusing on the transition towards a circular economy in the AEC sector.

AB  - Land use, transport, and energy-environment integration (LUTEI) is receiving considerable attention as an elaborate approach to improving urban resilience. Research evidence on this multidisciplinary topic tends to be fragmented, hindering constructive analysis of its role in shaping sustainable cities. This paper addresses this by undertaking a holistic systematic review to consolidate diverse perspectives. The analysis of 195 reviewed papers identified four main clusters of knowledge that include methodological approaches, policy instruments, urban design elements, and impacts of interventions. The analysis revealed that a growing body of literature is increasingly focused on improving accessibility planning, transit-oriented development, and policy integration to achieve sustainable and healthy transport as a vital element of resilience in cities. The review found, however, that the integration of environment and energy into land use and transport models is still at a nascent stage of development and has largely been overlooked in traditional LUTI models. This can lead to unreliable assessments of the impacts of low-carbon mobility solutions, emerging green transport technologies, and long-term changes in energy consumption affecting sustainable mobility futures. This paper concludes by connecting LUTEI dimensions to the UN’s sustainable development goals (SDG), outlining future directions to ignite meaningful research on the topic and providing a transparent path for decision-makers to adopt LUTEI-informed planning.

AB  - With Green Deals and a competitive techno-economic basis for low-carbon energy transitions, energy infra -structural change is intensifying. This is matched by rapid growth in scholarship on sociotechnical transitions and energy justice, combined in the phrase 'just transitions'. Yet how can an abstract concern with a normative concept like justice be brought to bear on the socio-technical complexities of specific changes in energy infra-structure? This is an important and timely question to consider in a practical sense, since the energy policy landscape is increasingly focused on a 'just transition' as combining decarbonisation and a progressive vision of social equity and justice. Our synthesis review argues that a focus on the alleviation of energy poverty - a condition whereby people are unable to secure adequate levels of energy services in the home - can enable policy-oriented mobilisation of energy justice as an integral component of evolving energy infrastructure. We approach energy poverty as an opportunity to constructively broach issues of justice in global energy policy discourse, not as a catch-all for wider injustices and vulnerabilities. We present a conceptual framework, applied to three schematic cases of energy infrastructure under transition. In and across these cross-sectoral cases, we reflect on scope for energy poverty alleviation.

AB  - Rapid urban expansion has aggravated the degradation of ecosystem services (ES). The ES provided by blue -green infrastructure (BGI) is a critical factor influencing the urban environmental quality, and its allocation is closely associated with the life quality and equal rights of urban residents. Here, considering the major envi-ronmental problems in the urbanization process of Wuhan, nine components of ES related to four different types of BGI were selected for study. First, we quantified and mapped the provision of ES by various types of BGI based on a quantitative table obtained by reviewing the current literature on ES. Then, we illustrated the relationship between BGI and regulating ES (illustrated the characteristic of the ES provided by BGI) from the perspective of contribution rate and efficiency, and analyzed the allocation equity of regulating ES with some sociological methods. Based on the Gini index, our results showed that the allocation of regulating ES based on population is highly inequitable (0.70), while that based on space is relatively equitable (0.15) in Wuhan at the whole city scale. The Gini index was calculated for the nine ES components, including SO2 absorption, dust retention, runoff mitigation, precipitation infiltration, cooling, humidifying, noise absorption, carbon fixation and oxygen release. The results reveal that there are slight differences among different ES components. Although the mean value of PAL (population-average allocation level; 3.08) is higher than that of SAL (spatial-average allocation level; 0.72) in Wuhan, PAL has a much higher standard deviation than SAL, indicating the existence of significant gaps in PAL of ES among different blocks. Based on the integration of PAL and SAL, the blocks with relatively sufficient SAL and PAL of regulating ES were found to be mainly located in the northeast of the city, while those with very insufficient SAL and PAL of regulating ES are highly urbanized areas. Besides, the block with very insufficient SAL of regulating ES is located in urban industrial areas close to the suburbs, while those with insufficient PAL of regulating ES are scattered in the area close to the suburbs, respectively. Then, we proposed three priority levels and a judgment model for appropriate interventions based on allocation inequity in urban blocks. Our findings provide important implications for urban planning by associating ES with resident welfare.

AB  - Land use land cover (LULC) changes due to rapid urbanization pose critical challenges to sustainable development, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions like Saudi Arabia, where cities such as Abha are experiencing unprecedented expansion. Urban sprawl is accelerating environmental degradation, affecting key natural resources such as vegetation, water bodies, and barren land. This study introduces an advanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)-based framework for high-accuracy LULC classification, urban sprawl quantification, and ecosystem service assessment, providing a more precise and scalable approach compared to traditional remote sensing techniques. A hybrid methodology combining ML models—Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting Machine, and LightGBM—with a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was fine-tuned using grid search optimization to enhance classification accuracy. The integration of deep learning improves feature extraction and classification consistency, achieving an AUC of 0.93 for Dense Vegetation and 0.82 for Cropland, outperforming conventional classification methods. The study also applies the Markov transition model to project land cover changes, offering a probabilistic understanding of urban expansion trends and ecosystem dynamics, providing a significant improvement over static LULC assessments by quantifying transition probabilities and predicting future land cover transformations. The results reveal that urban areas in Abha expanded by 120.74 km2 between 2014 and 2023, with barren land decreasing by 557.09 km2 and cropland increasing by 205.14 km2. The peak ecosystem service value (ESV) loss was recorded at USD 125,662.7 between 2017 and 2020, but subsequent land management efforts improved ESV to USD 96,769.5 by 2023. The resilience and recovery of natural land cover types, particularly barren land (44,163 km2 recovered by 2023), indicate the potential for targeted restoration strategies. This study advances urban sustainability research by integrating state-of-the-art deep learning models with Markov-based land change predictions, enhancing the accuracy and predictive capability of LULC assessments. The findings highlight the need for proactive land management policies to mitigate the adverse effects of urban sprawl and promote sustainable ecosystem service recovery. The methodological advancements presented in this study provide a scalable and adaptable framework for future urbanization impact assessments, particularly in rapidly developing regions.

AB  - Chinese metropolitan areas have been experiencing urbanization over the past decades, impacting biodiversity, carbon emissions, urban heat islands, and food security. Yet, systematic research on spatio-temporal urbanization patterns and drivers along the urban-rural gradient is rarely reported for northwest China. Here, we use land-use data from 1980 to 2015 to explore land-use change, urbanization intensity, and drivers in northwest China. Our results display direct and indirect effects of urban expansion on farmland loss, but also spatio-temporal heterogeneity in the urbanization patterns. While the earlier years were dominated by infill and land conversion close to city centers, the later years displayed sprawling urbanization following the constraints of terrain and administrative boundaries at the cost of farmland. Our regression analysis of spatial variables found a strong relationship with urban planning factors. The spatial analysis of urbanization patterns revealed indirect land-use change on former farmland. Furthermore, we found that regional geography and historic sites considerably influenced land conversion. Overall, our findings indicate the need for sustainable planning strategies that synthesize approaches to farmland and historic site protection and consideration of regionally specific landscape characteristics.

AB  - It is of critical importance to develop appropriate assessment tools with which to comprehensively measure the sustainability status of a region in order to guide its transformation to sustainable development. This paper proposes a novel method of sustainability assessment based on urban eco-efficiency, which calculates the ratios of welfare and ecological impact. This method can demonstrate the relative sustainability status of targeted regions for different time periods, and it implicitly considers comprehensive urban information including ecology, economy and society. By using the human development index (HDI) and ecological footprint (EF) as measures of urban welfare and ecological burden, we carried out a case study of Xiamen City during 2000-2006 using the proposed method. The results indicated that there is a fluctuation of eco-efficiency, which shows a steady increase then a sharp decline, with a marginal increase towards the end of the studied period. Overall, eco-efficiency, resource efficiency and environmental efficiency declined 0.155-, 0.157- and 0.153-times, respectively, during this period. This means that the increase of ecological consumption is faster than improvement of social welfare. As a result, urban sustainability declines, and its future increase depend on improvements of both resource and environment efficiency. Our method proved effective in analysing the relative sustainability status among targeted regions for different time periods, paving the way for practical applications, such as policy analysis, in pursuit of sustainable development.

AB  - Varanasi, India's historic cultural capital, struggles with efficient waste management practices. This impacts environment and human well-being in terms of waste generation that is estimated around 550-650 TPD with a generation rate of 0.42 kg capita(-1) day(-1) (n=117). The present study aims to explore and characterize wastes, current practices, ecological profiling, and phytotoxicity of an abandoned open dumping site, and vermicomposting of organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) as sustainable waste management approach. Compositional analysis of waste indicates organic fraction (46.13%) as a major component along with a considerable amount of heavy metals. The calorific value and moisture content of municipal solid waste (MSW) was 2351.4 cal g(-1) and 34.72%, respectively. Ecological profiling of the dumping site revealed that floral diversity and ecological species/indicators were negatively affected. Likewise, phytotoxicity results displayed a negative impact on germination and physiology of maize (Zea mays L.) plants grown on dumping site soil. Vermistabilization of OFMSW showed a significant increase in N (56.10-89.48%), P (33.93-82.87%), and K (25.55-50.42%) and a decrease in total organic carbon (15.15-24.81%). Similarly, C/N and C/P ratios decreased by 1.89-2.51 and 1.72-2.18 folds, respectively. A survey of stakeholders suggested that open dumping was the main practice adopted by Varanasi Municipal Corporation (VMC) during 2013-2015. Recently (2017-2018), VMC adopted different methods, such as door-to-door collection and source segregation for effective waste management. Waste characteristics and nutrient profile of the vermicompost explains that vermicomposting could be used for efficient waste management in Varanasi, further reducing the collection, transportation, and disposal costs of waste, which enables to close the loop and move towards a circular economy. Moreover, implications of existing waste management practices and possible management options need to be addressed scientifically. Therefore, this research outcome will help in designing a successful waste management plan for Varanasi and other cities with similar waste characteristics.

AB  - Increasing urbanization augments impervious surface area, which results in increased run off volumes and peak flows. Green Infrastructure (GI) approaches are a decentralized alternative for sustainable urban stormwater and provide an array of ecosystem services and foster community building by enhancing neighborhood aesthetics, increasing property value, and providing shared green spaces. While projects involving sustainability concepts and environmental design are favored in privileged communities, marginalized communities have historically been located in areas that suffer from environmental degradation. Underprivileged communities typically do not receive as many social and environmental services as advantaged communities. This research explores GI-based management strategies that are evaluated at the watershed scale to improve hydrological performance by mitigating storm water run off volumes and peak flows. GI deployment strategies are developed to address environmental justice issues by prioritizing placement in communities that are underprivileged and locations with high outreach potential. A hydrologic/hydraulic stormwater model is developed using the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM 5.1) to simulate the impacts of alternative management strategies. Management scenarios include the implementation of rain water harvesting in private households, the decentralized implementation of bioretention cells in private households, the centralized implementation of bioretention cells in municipally owned vacant land, and combinations of those strategies. Realities of implementing Cl on private and public lands are taken into account to simulate various levels of coverage and routing for bioretention cell scenarios. The effects of these strategies are measured by the volumetric reduction of run off and reduction in peak flow; social benefits are not evaluated. This approach is applied in an underprivileged community within the Walnut Creek Watershed in Raleigh, North Carolina. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Over 50% of world's population presently resides in cities, and this number is expected to rise to similar to 70% by 2050. Increasing urbanization problems including population growth, urban sprawl, land use change, unemployment, and environmental degradation, have markedly impacted urban residents. Quality of Life (QOL). Therefore, urban sustainability and its measurement have gained increasing attention from administrators, urban planners, and scientific communities throughout the world with respect to improving urban development and human well-being. The widely accepted definition of urban sustainability emphasizes the balancing development of three primary domains (urban economy, society, and environment). This article attempts to improve the aforementioned definition of urban sustainability by incorporating a human well-being dimension. Major problems identified in existing urban sustainability indicator (USI) models include a weak integration of potential indicators, poor measurement and quantification, and insufficient spatial-temporal analysis. To tackle these challenges an integrated USI model based on a hierarchical indices system was established for monitoring and evaluating urban sustainability. This model can be performed by quantifying indicators using both traditional statistical approaches and advanced geomatic techniques based on satellite imagery and census data, which aims to provide a theoretical basis for a comprehensive assessment of urban sustainability from a spatial-temporal perspective.

AB  - The aim of this letter is to raise some critical concerns and gaps in the booming literature on Smart Cities; concerns that we think deserve greater attention from scientists, policy makers and urban planners. Using an urban ecology lens, we provide some reflections that need to forgo any wider-scale implementation of the Smart City-model with the goal to enhance urban sustainability. We discuss that the Smart City literature must better include analysis around social sustainability issues for city dwellers. Focus here should start on health issues and more critical analysis about whom the Smart City is for. Also, the literature must address issues of resilience and cyber security, including how Smart City solutions may affect the autonomy of urban governance, personal integrity and how it may affect the resilience of infrastructures that provide inhabitants with basic needs, such as food, energy and water security. A third major gap in this literature is how smart city developments may change human-nature relations. Focus here should start on how Smart City technologies may hinder or support children's learning towards a stronger psychological connection with nature. Discussions are also needed on how the Smart City model may affect pro-environmental behavior more broadly. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Transition towards more sustainable and resilient economies is crucial to provide sustainable economic development by considering environmental protection and social well-being. There is an increasing focus on the concept of territorial competitiveness that encompasses the aspects of environmental, social, and economic sustainability. Thus, this study aims to analyse the factors affecting the territorial competitiveness index in the Izmir town. To facilitate a comprehensive analysis of the factors that impact territorial competitiveness, a systematic approach is employed through the use of a system dynamic model. This model enables the exploration of the complex and dynamic relationships between key parameters, providing insights into their interdependencies and how they cooperatively influence the territorial competitiveness index. The results show that Gross Domestic Product growth rate, renewable energy production and technology innovation index is increased rapidly. This increase caused by development of social well-being in the region. However, sustainable land use and waste is decreased and therefore CO2 is increased in the 2010 and 2027. Besides, territorial competitiveness index is expected to increase till 2027 since subsidies in energy and material (re)use, efficient use of resources (circular economy), achievement of economic development and technological investments. Governments and businesses should adopt sustainable strategies for improving territorial competitiveness index and balancing economic growth with environmental protection and social welfare in the regional context.

AB  - Sustainable urban development is a common concern of humanity. In order to achieve high-quality urban development, it is imperative to measure cities' sustainability gaps within urban agglomerations and explore the factors affecting sustainability. However, most studies focus on factors at the municipal scale, and the role of intra-urban structure and inter-urban interactions in urban sustainability remains unclear. To address these issues, we analyzed 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) of each city within the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration (YRDUA), and explored the spatial distribution differences of urban sustainability. In addition, we quantified the impact of urban functional areas, land use, space of flows, geographical location, and climate on "Economy-Society-Environment" (ESE) system by applying the random forest algorithm (RFA)-SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) model. The results show that the eastern YRDUA (coastal area) has outstanding ESE system coordination; the northern YRDUA (heavy industrial area) performs well in economic sustainability but not in the environment; the southwestern YRDUA (high-density forest area) has better environmental performance than its economy and society. Improving transportation facilities and promoting inter-city cooperation are beneficial to economic sustainability; improving social well-being contributes to social sustainability; reducing carbon emissions and protecting urban green areas are crucial for environmental sustainability.

AB  - While substantial efforts have been made to identify and address issues of environmental justice in urban areas, the question of how to consider and plan for the concerns of humans and other species remains a major challenge. This paper provides a conceptualisation of what 'justice' might mean from a multispecies justice (MSJ) perspective within the contexts of nature-based solutions (NBS) and urban sustainability planning. We offer a wider conceptualisation of representation, distribution and agency compared with dominant framings in NBS scholarship and provide exemplar cases on how to integrate these concepts in planning discourse. We critically discuss some of the challenges and opportunities of considering MSJ when confronted by established procedures and practices in NBS science and decision-making, focusing on (i) moving beyond existing standards for biodiversity conservation; (ii) embracing MSJ as a process and practice; and (iii) building the capacity of NBS planners to work with MSJ.

AB  - Major problems at final waste processing sites (TPAs) include leachate, groundwater pollution, public health, and social aspects. Landfills are a major contributor to environmental damage in the world with effects on warming, acidification, smog formation, eutrophication, ecotoxicity and cancer to human health and non-cancer categories. Waste management in D.K.I Jakarta Province is currently facing a shortage of Integrated Waste Management Site (TPST) space with waste production reaching 7,000 to 7,500 tons/day. The main challenge in today’s municipal solid waste management is the selection of the most appropriate waste processing scenario, where the chosen method must be efficient and effective in minimizing leaching and emissions and reducing landfill waste, so that the service life of final disposal will be longer. Final disposal Bantargebang is the largest final disposal in Indonesia with an area of 132,5 Ha, where 80% is used for waste management and 20% of the land is used for support facilities. Final disposal Bantargebang implements various technologies in waste management including landfill, PLTSA, composting, and refuse-derived fuel (RDF) and involves scavengers in waste management at final disposal Bantargebang. The most dominant type of waste is food waste which reaches 39%. Various current technologies are still not effective, the implementation of sanitary landfills in final disposal Bantargebang is still very difficult to meet the planned design criteria, and tends to implement open dumping. This increases the potential for groundwater and surface water pollution and contributes to increased GHGs. Surface water in final disposal Bantargebang is highly polluted with COD and BOD parameters that exceed quality standards. Therefore, the multi-technology applied at final disposal Bantargebang only achieves an efficiency of 8% of incoming waste and the rest is still landfill waste in the landfill zone which is 92%.

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into environmental monitoring, climate action, and sustainability has become increasingly important, particularly in tackling the global challenges associated with climate change. In this article, we critically assess the role of AI within the frameworks of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and 13 (Climate Action). This study shows how AI applications can significantly enhance climate resilience and promote sustainable urban development. AI technologies enable extensive data collection and analysis through various methods, including remote sensing and sensor networks, which improve assessments of air and water quality, land use changes, and biodiversity monitoring. Another significant advantage of AI is its ability to optimize energy consumption across various sectors, leading to substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, we demonstrate that AI enhances waste management strategies by identifying recycling opportunities and streamlining logistics, ultimately contributing to waste reduction and fostering a circular economy. In the fields of agriculture and forestry, AI systems have proven effective in improving crop management and pest control practices, mitigating environmental impacts while increasing food productivity. Furthermore, AI plays a vital role in wildlife conservation efforts by assisting in tracking endangered species and analyzing satellite imagery to combat illegal activities. We also illustrate how AI supports the development of predictive climate models, enabling policymakers to create science-based strategies for effectively navigating extreme weather and climate risks, thereby fostering resilient infrastructure decisions. While the transformative potential of AI in climate initiatives is clear, we address several limitations and ethical challenges associated with its application, including concerns about data quality and accessibility, biases in AI algorithms, and the need for transparency in AI-driven decision-making. These challenges emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and robust engagement strategies to ensure that AI applications promote equitable access to solutions for marginalized populations affected by climate change. Moreover, we examine how the COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped the landscape of AI for sustainable development, revealing both challenges and opportunities in implementing AI technologies. The pandemic has led to increased investment in remote monitoring technologies while highlighting the need for collaborative approaches to address the complex interdependencies between public health and climate resilience. Through a synthesis of relevant literature and case studies, we advocate for a holistic and collaborative approach to utilizing AI technologies in environmental management to achieve the SDGs successfully. By fostering innovation and inclusivity in decision-making processes, society can leverage AI's potential to create a sustainable and resilient future, thus advancing comprehensive climate action in alignment with the United Nations’ mission.HighlightsAI can boost climate action by enhancing energy efficiency, optimizing agriculture, and improving disaster response efforts.The integration of AI supports SDG-11 (Sustainable Cities) and SDG-13 (Climate Action), fostering sustainable and resilient communities.Addressing AI limitations, is crucial for effective climate solutions and achieving sustainable development goals.

AB  - Sustainable urban development is an increasingly important concept as cities around the world continue to grow and face challenges related to urbanization, including environmental degradation, social inequality, and economic instability. Chiang Mai is a rapidly growing city in Thailand that steers towards sustainability. In this work, we examine the state of sustainable urban development in Chiang Mai by analyzing various indicators, including transportation, waste management, air quality, and energy consumption. A multi-dimensional framework was used to assess the sustainability of Chiang Mai. Our analysis suggests that while Chiang Mai has made progress in some areas of sustainable urban development, such as promoting green transportation and waste reduction and reduction consumption, there are still many challenges to be addressed, particularly in air pollution, water management, transportation and energy consumption. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for policy makers, urban planners, and other stakeholders interested in promoting sustainable urban development. This study assesses Chiang Mai's sustainability using a comprehensive set of 35 indicators. It was found that Chiang Mai has potential for sustainable development, but some indicators require improvement. The study presents guidelines for prioritizing sustainable development, improving air and water quality, promoting sustainable tourism, enhancing waste management, transportation management and energy consumption. This research provides alternative framework for evaluating cities and presents a valuable contribution to the field of sustainable urban development.

AB  - Urban development and the sprawl of transport infrastructures have disregarded the crucial function of metropolitan landscape in provisioning human well-being and biodiversity. This research aims to contribute to the challenges of Planning for Sustainability by proposing a Socioecological Integrated Analysis (SIA) to support the Land Use Master Plan in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area, to conciliate urban development with the performance of surrounding open spaces. The paper evaluates four different land cover scenarios (current, trending, alternative and potential), and two kinds of agricultural management (conventional and a socioecological transition towards organic agriculture). The results suggest that although there are significant improvements on job provisioning and nutrient-cycling closures (circular economy), certified organic agriculture is not enough to overcome some trends of industrialized agrarian systems such as low energy efficiency or poor improvements in greenhouse gas emissions. The results also show a crossed effect between social metabolism and landscape ecology where changes in the management could affect the landscape functioning while changes in the land covers are particularly affecting the resource use. Then, deeper changes that consider together land use and metabolic flows are required to promote more sustainable agroecological transitions. The SIA model is an important conceptual and methodological step forward that facilitates the transition towards sustainable land use policies.

AB  - Driven by unprecedented economic development for more than three decades, China's urbanization level rose from 17.9% in 1978 to 54.8% in 2014. This breakneck speed of urbanization has resulted in myriad environmental problems and social inequities. To gauge the urban sustainability of China, our study focused on ten megacities which are socioeconomic centers of the country. We evaluated the three dimensions of sustainability using a set of sustainability indicators, including Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), Ecological Footprint (EF), Biocapacity, Environmental Performance Index (EPI), City Development Index (CDI), Human Development Index (HDI), Gini coefficient, and Urban-rural income ratio. Based on time-series data from 1978 to 2012, our study has produced the following findings: (1) The values of GPI for the ten megacities started to increase since 2006 after a relatively constant period between 1994 and 2005; (2) The pressures of economic growth on the environment (EF) increased while biocapacity decreased for the ten megacities, with smaller biocapacity deficits for western cities; (3) The overall level of human wellbeing (HDI) increased; (4) Socioeconomic inequality (Gini and urban-rural income ratio) widened, but the widening trend seemed to have ceased in recent years for most of the ten megacities; and (5) Certain aspects of urban environment and city development (EPI and CDI) improved gradually, particularly in waste treatment and infrastructure development. Our findings suggest that, to achieve overall urban sustainability, China must move away from maximizing economic development and focus on improving environmental quality of its megacities.

AB  - Circular Economy (CE) is a promising solution for a wide range of stakeholders, including companies, governments, and society at large to confront serious environmental concerns (Crome et al., 2023) to address resource depletion, environmental degradation, and waste generation. As Cambodia's economy heavily relies on resource extraction and export-oriented industries (e.g., textile industry and agriculture contributing significantly to GDP), it generates substantial waste (fundamentally, Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), but also industrial, construction and demolition waste (UNDP, 2022a,b)), and pollution. To tackle such issues, the government has recently demonstrated a stronger commitment to sustainable development by integrating CE principles into a national policy. First, this paper explores the current environmental issues of the country. Secondly, it assessed the country's CE Strategy and Action Plan. Thirdly, as a primary finding, it was discussed the potential barriers, international collaboration prospects, and implementation recommendations to catalyze challenges into opportunities, covering the gaps observed in the country's CE Strategy and Action Plan, and following prominent CE trends. Lastly, it concludes that despite the hurdles, CE has the potential in the country to provide socioeconomic benefits, including job creation, resilience, reduced reliance on imports, and improved public health. This paper consisting of policy analysis combined with a bibliographical review presumably represents the first work on this topic; it will be useful for foreign investors, academia, and policymakers.

AB  - Urban green spaces (UGS) can counter the ill effects of urbanization in high-density cities. Studies related to these aspects are rare in Indian cities, however. This article aims to assess the availability and accessibility of UGS in Raipur, India. The objectives are to identify the status of UGS alteration, determine the status of available UGS, and identify the optimum population density for which UGS can be made available and accessible. Land use change detection, fragmentation index, availability index, UGS per capita, and neighborhood accessibility are used to assess aspects of UGS. The results show an increase in built-up area (24.32 percent) from 2010 to 2020. They also show a decrease in the UGS availability index and an increase in the fragmentation index from the city center to the outskirts. Uneven distribution of UGS categories is found all over the studied urban area. Low-density areas have more UGS per capita available than high-density areas, whereas medium-high-density areas have the maximum UGS accessibility. The study concludes with density-wise implications to maximize the UGS benefits and identifies medium-high density as the optimum density that allows high accessibility to the available UGS.

AB  - Electrification is an efficient way to decarbonize by replacing fossil fuels with low-emission power. In addition, energy efficiency measures can reduce consumption, making it easier to shift to a zero-carbon society. In Québec, upgrades to aging buildings that employ electric resistance heating offer a unique opportunity to free up large amounts of hydroelectricity that can serve to decarbonize heating in other buildings. However, another source of energy would be needed to electrify mobility because efficiency measures free up small amounts of electricity in summer compared to winter. This study reveals how building efficiency measures combined with solar electricity generation provide an energy profile that matches the requirements for decarbonizing both mobility and heating. The TRNSYS software was used to simulate the annual energy performance of an existing house and retrofitted/rebuilt low-energy houses equipped with a photovoltaic (PV) roof in Montreal, Québec, Canada (45.5° N). The electricity that is made available by upgrading the houses is mainly considered for powering battery and fuel cell electric vehicles (BEVs and FCEVs) and electrifying heating in greenhouses. The results indicate that retrofitting 16% or rebuilding 12% of single-detached homes in Québec can provide enough electricity to decarbonize heating energy use in existing greenhouses and to operate the new greenhouses required for growing all fresh vegetables locally. If all the single-detached houses that employ electric resistance heating are upgraded, 33.4 and 21.8 TWh year−1 of electricity would be available for decarbonization, equivalent to a 19% and 12% increase of the province’s electricity supply for the retrofitted or rebuilt houses, respectively. This is enough energy to convert 83–100% of personal vehicles to BEVs or 35–56% to FCEVs. Decarbonization using the electricity that is made available by upgrading to low-energy solar houses could reduce the province’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by approximately 32% (26.5 MtCO2eq). The time required for the initial embodied GHG emissions to surpass the emissions avoided by electrification ranges from 3.4 to 11.2 years. Building energy efficiency retrofits/rebuilds combined with photovoltaics is a promising approach for Québec to maximize the decarbonization potential of its existing energy resources while providing local energy and food security.

AB  - The integration of nature and sustainability in urban planning has become a vital focus for cities around the world in the face of rapid urbanization, environmental degradation, and climate change. As urban areas expand, the relationship between the built environment and the natural world has become increasingly important. This article explores the significance of incorporating nature into urban planning, highlighting the benefits for environmental sustainability, human health, and overall urban resilience. It also examines the challenges and strategies involved in fostering nature-based solutions, such as green spaces, green roofs, and sustainable water management systems. The paper discusses the importance of collaboration between urban planners, policymakers, and communities to create cities that promote ecological health, social well-being, and long-term sustainability. The conclusion emphasizes the need for a holistic, integrated approach to urban design that balances the demands of urban development with the preservation and enhancement of natural ecosystems.

AB  - In ten years, more than half the world's population will be living in cities. The United Nations (UN) has stated that this will threaten cities with social conflict, environmental degradation and the collapse of basic services. The economic, social, and environmental planning practices of societies embodying 'urban sustainability' have been proposed as antidotes to these negative urban trends. 'Urban sustainability' is a doctrine with diverse origins. The author believes that the alternative models of cultural development in Curitiba, Brazil, Kerala, India, and Nayarit, Mexico embody the integration and interlinkage of economic, social, and environmental sustainability. Curitiba has become a more livable city by building an efficient intra-urban bus system, expanding urban green space, and meeting the basic needs of the urban poor. Kerala has attained social harmony by emphasizing equitable resource distribution rather than consumption, by restraining reproduction, and by attacking divisions of race, caste, religion, and gender. Nayarit has sought to balance development with the environment by framing a nature-friendly development plan that protects natural systems from urban development and that involves the public in the development process. A detailed examination of these alternative cultural development models reveals a myriad of possible means by which economic, social, and environmental sustainability might be advanced in practice. The author concludes that while these examples from the developing world cannot be directly translated to cities in the developed world, they do indicate in a general sense the imaginative policies that any society must foster if it is to achieve 'urban sustainability'.

AB  - Dispersed low-density development–“urban sprawl”–has many detrimental environmental, economic, and social consequences. Sprawl leads to higher greenhouse-gas emissions and poses an increasing threat to the long-term availability of many vital ecosystem services. Therefore, urban sprawl is in stark contradiction to the principles of sustainable land use and to the need for a sustainability transformation. This study presents the degree of urban sprawl on the planet at multiple spatial scales (continents, UN regions, countries, subnational units, and a regular grid) for the period 1990–2014. Urban sprawl increased by 95% in 24 years, almost 4% per year, with built-up areas growing by almost 28 km2 per day, or 1.16 km2 per hour. The results demonstrate that Europe has been the most sprawled and also the most rapidly sprawling continent, by 51% since 1990. At the scale of UN regions, the highest relative increases in urban sprawl were observed in East Asia, Western Africa, and Southeast Asia. Urban sprawl per capita has been highest in Oceania and North America, exhibiting a minor decline since 1990, while it has been increasing rapidly in Europe, by almost 47% since 1990. The study revealed a strong relationship between urban sprawl and the level of human development as measured by the Human Development Index (HDI). The results suggest that it will be important for a more sustainable future to find a better balance between a high quality of life and using land more sparingly. There is an urgent need to stop urban sprawl, since current regulations and measures in developed countries are apparently not effective at limiting it. Monitoring urban sprawl can serve to guide policy development such as the implementation of targets and limits and to evaluate the effectiveness of urban growth management strategies at mitigating urban sprawl.

AB  - The focus on a growth-oriented development paradigm has led to unsustainable outcomes such as environmental degradation, resource depletion, increased inequality, and compromised social wellbeing. An alternative approach known as the Doughnut Economy has emerged, offering a new economic development model that aims to guide humanity towards staying within planetary boundaries. The Doughnut model visualizes sustainable development with an ecological ceiling as the outer limit and a social foundation as the inner boundary. This study attempts to create a Doughnut Economy Index for 34 provinces in Indonesia, categorizing them into four groups to assess how well they meet societal needs while remaining within planetary limits. The index, derived from a simple formula, yields two indices: social performance and ecological damage. The research reveals that only three out of the 34 provinces in Indonesia fall within the safe zone of the Doughnut model. Shortfall issues are prevalent in Eastern Indonesian provinces like Papua, Maluku, and Nusa Tenggara Islands, while overshoot concerns are more prominent in provinces in Kalimantan and Java & Bali Islands.

AB  - Amidst the escalating challenges of global warming and energy crises, the rapid development of distributed renewable energy resources has emerged as a critical strategy. Regional integrated energy systems (RIESs) have garnered significant attention for their potential to integrate and optimize both distributed renewable energy resources and conventional energy facilities. This article presents a bilevel optimization framework for the electricity-storage coupling market in multi-RIES, considering the integration of 6G network slicing technology and battery energy storage (BES) capacity sharing. The upper-level model maximizes the profit of generation units by optimizing their bidding strategies, while the lower-level model aims to maximize social welfare through market clearing. The proposed line search-based global Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm addresses the limitations of existing algorithms with necessary and innovative improvements to tackle the challenge of global convergence in nonsmooth optimization problems. Numerical case studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating enhanced BES utilization, increased renewable energy generation, and improved social welfare. The results also highlight the sensitivity of social welfare to communication costs, underscoring the importance of careful cost calibration.

AB  - The German government has committed to GHG neutrality by 2045. This implies the designation of a physical quantity whose zero line ensures the achievement of the goals of the Paris Agreement. To date, a binding definition of terms with specifications on the assessment scale and method, system boundaries and on acceptable compensation measures is lacking. Since every construction process creates an ecological footprint, ‘GHG-neutral buildings’ can only be understood as a calculation model for the longer-term compensation of the climate and environmental damage that is currently being caused. A reduction to GHG-emissions thus fails to achieve the goal of building within planetary boundaries. Within the building sector, the German Climate Protection Act only takes into account energy consumption during the operational phase, leaving out emissions that occur in other life cycle stages i.e. sectors. Thus, no incentives are created to exploit a wider cross-sectoral climate and environmental protection potential of the entire buildings’ lifecycles. Existing definitions of the concept of ‘climate and GHG-neutrality’ are analysed in general and specifically in relation to buildings. Research criteria are calculation bases and life cycle-related system boundaries. Based on a built case study, life cycle assessment (LCA) is used to quantify the ‘delta’ resulting from divergent definitions in terms of GHG-emissions. This paper will quantify emissions according to divergent definitions of climate- and GHG-neutrality for a new construction scenario and also for a renovation scenario, as well as two different building material scenarios. Also, the paper will derive emission reduction potentials of sufficiency measures by applying LCA already in an early design process. To outline the role of buildings in decarbonizing the built environment, the entire life cycle is considered, including those modules that are currently outside the standard. Additional indicators (e.g. consumption of fresh water or total material input) are discussed regarding a possible shift in the ecological footprint and the building’s adherence to planetary boundaries.

Cities can host a high richness of plants and animals, and this urban biodiversity supports multiple regulating, provisioning and cultural ecosystem services. Developing biodiversity-friendly cities is thus inextricably linked to sustainable urban development and human wellbeing. The contributions to this Special Issue on "Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Urban Development" in the journalSustainabilityillustrate the role of urban environments as pressures on biodiversity, and envision pathways towards developing more biodiverse urban environments that are accepted and supported by people. Contributions reveal promising opportunities for conserving biodiversity within many urban landscapes. The insights from this Special Issue can support urban conservation policies and their implementation in the development of sustainable cities.

AB  - As a result of rapid economic development, urban expansion reduced the cropland in China. To secure the food supply, cropland displacement to maintain the quantity and quality of cropland has been implemented. Here, we quantified the biodiversity losses due to cropland displacement resulting from urban expansion from a telecoupling perspective in China from 1980 to 2020. A comprehensive multimodel assessment demonstrated that the indirect biodiversity losses due to cropland displacement resulting from urban expansion were approximately 2 to 3 times higher than its direct biodiversity losses, at a total loss of approximately 0.6 % to 1.0 %, as indicated by three biodiversity indicators. Displaced cropland with a higher biodiversity cost but lower cropland productivity is the main reason for the excessive indirect losses and suggests that socioecological processes may be detrimental to the synergistic benefits of the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) for food security and terrestrial biodiversity. This study also identified source-sink hotspots for indirect biodiversity losses, which can contribute to improving biodiversity conservation, optimizing the spatial distribution of cropland and thus enhancing socioecological system sustainability.

AB  - In terms of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), combined with good health and wellbeing (SDG 3), are vital. The world is not making adequate progress in meeting the UN’s targets to address food security (SDG 2). In South Africa, the growing population, rapid urbanization, poverty, and unemployment exacerbate the issue of food security; even more so considering climate change (SDG 13). The built environment needs to respond to these demands and incorporate green initiatives that can provide ecosystem services. Novel approaches are required to optimize land use and promote sustainable built environments through food production. This paper consolidates literature on local vertical urban food production with vegetable crops to enhance ecosystem services and lower the carbon footprint of buildings in the Global South. The literature review points to the potential of small-scale edible living walls that utilize local materials and traditional African vegetable (TAV) species to enhance system sustainability and resilience. TAV species offer advantages as opposed to exotic food crops as they are tolerant to extreme heat and drought, have a high nutritional value, and have low irrigation and agrochemical maintenance requirements.

AB  - According to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the sustainable development goal 11 is to "make cities and human settlement inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable". China has been making great effort in this respect. With the advancement in science and technology, the concepts of green development, environmental friendliness, and fair development are gradually moving from theories to practices, guiding the construction and development of sustainable cities in China. Over the past 40 years of reform and opening up, the overall process of China's construction of sustainable cities and development can be divided into three stages: the initial practice stage (1986-2000), the stage focusing on transformation (2001-2012), and the stage emphasizing coordinated development and social fairness (2012 to present). During the process, China has proposed and carried out a series of pilot demonstrations of sustainable cities, eco-cities, garden cities, low-carbon cities, livable cities, resilient cities, sanitary cities, sponge cities, and circular economy cities. It has achieved remarkable results with valuable experience; meanwhile, it still faces many challenges considering the current practices. With the integration of planning for the national economy and social development, rural and urban development, land use, and other aspects, as well as the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, sustainable urban practices in China will receive more policy support and effective administrative support. As the largest developing country in the world, China's practice in sustainable urban development undoubtedly has a broad demonstration effect and can contribute to global sustainable development.

AB  - A significant cultural shift occurred over recent decades, with the majority of the world’s population now living in cities and contributing over two thirds of global carbon emissions. If countries around the world are to meet challenging global carbon reduction targets, then how our cities are governed and managed to maximize energy efficiency is of vital importance. Faith is increasingly being placed in what are commonly referred to as ‘smart cities.’ Smart cities seemingly offer a utopian vision of urban integration, efficiency and [subsequent] carbon reductions, yet urbanisation presents real challenges, as noted by Sustainable Development Goal 11: “Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”. Cities are made up of people and increasingly both policymakers and practitioners are starting to see citizens as an essential stakeholder, even if there is a blurring over the boundaries between citizens and consumers. It is unclear what these people actually refer to when they talk about citizen engagement. Adopting key theoretical underpinning of ladder of participation (Arnstein), this research will present findings from case studies of novel citizen engagement from around the world, notably Nottingham (UK), Espoo (Finland) and Portland (USA). Utilising semi-structured interview material findings are analysed through critical framework of citizen engagement to see whether they fulfil the notion of smart cities and communities. Specifically, new forms of engagement that do not fit previously held assumptions around participation need to be considered. Recommendations are provided for increasing new forms of citizen engagement in smart city strategies in order to ensure they are fully adopted and embedded.

AB  - The spatial configuration of urban areas impacts environmental sustainability, social equity, and economic and social resilience. This study examines the intricate relationship between spatial arrangements and the planning and design of BREEAM Outstanding projects in London, UK. It analyses the relationship between urban morphology and the effectiveness of sustainable building practices and contributes to the broader objectives of urban sustainability. This research focuses on London, UK—a city renowned for its complex urban fabric and architectural heterogeneity—using a multi-case study approach to dissect the elements that facilitate the development of BREEAM Outstanding projects. This study analyses key spatial characteristics such as land use diversity, subway network analysis, and street network analysis using betweenness centrality of edges and node degrees. These factors are considered due to their impact on energy performance, carbon emissions, and social sustainability metrics. Furthermore, this research explores how urban design strategies, such as enhanced walkability and mixed-use development, reinforce the success of BREEAM-certified Outstanding-rated projects. The findings of this investigation reveal a correlation between urban environments and the development of BREEAM Outstanding-rated projects in London. By aligning the spatial organisation of urban form with BREEAM principles, urban planners, policymakers, and architects can facilitate the creation of cities that are environmentally sustainable, socially inclusive, and economically prosperous. The research offers substantive insights and actionable recommendations for future urban development, advocating for a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach to sustainable city planning and design. The spatial arrangement of urban form impacts the planning and design of BREEAM Outstanding projects. Findings from current and future research will be used to investigate the connections between spatial arrangement and various categories in BREEAM and how they can influence future sustainable urban environments to set a benchmark for sustainability for contributing to a more equitable urban future.

AB  - Material selection in buildings profoundly affects project success, encompassing durability, maintenance, customer satisfaction, production systems, lifecycle, usage, environment, and costs. Yet, there is a need for further research on indicators for choosing materials in prefabricated buildings. Therefore, this study’s main objective was to identify the indicators (criteria and sub-criteria) for selecting materials for prefabricated wooden construction and, subsequently, categorize these criteria and sub-criteria based on the perspective of industry professionals. To achieve this goal, three phases were carried out. First, a literature review was conducted to identify potential criteria for choosing structural and envelope materials in wooden prefabricated buildings. Second, a pilot survey was conducted in Canada and the United States to classify the priority order of the criteria obtained from the literature based on professionals’ opinions. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations were conducted with different iterations (1000, 10,000, and 100,000) using the data obtained from the previous phase to improve decision-making and classification processes. For the indicators to select materials, the literature review identified seven main criteria: performance properties, green materials, energy efficiency, circular economy, site conditions and material logistics, standards, and social impact. These criteria contained a total of 25 sub-criteria. The pilot survey data analysis demonstrated that the performance properties, site conditions and material logistics, and social impact criteria were consistently prioritized. The critical sub-criteria identified were fire resistance, watertightness, local availability, occupant health, and safety and protection. For the Monte Calo simulations, the predictions aligned with the pilot study, enhancing the robustness of the results.

AB  - Many cities across the country are developing sustainability agendas and competing for the title of the "greenest city". This research evaluates how one of the leading US citywide sustainability plans, New York's 2007 PlaNYC, deals with concerns about equity and environmental justice (EJ). By examining the politics around PlaNYC, the plan itself, and the subsequent land use decision-making, this paper explores the extent to which PlaNYC has changed the City's planning framework to promote EJ. EJ advocates give PlaNYC and the planning process surrounding it mixed reviews suggesting that there is more work to be done to counteract the power dynamics that shape inequitable and unjust urban land-use decisions.

AB  - Smart cities are rapidly gaining momentum around the world as new opportunities to shift towards a sustainable urban future. Despite their promising solutions, there is so far little evidence on how smart city initiatives can achieve urban sustainability. This study explores the impact of smartness on urban sustainability by introducing the concept of smart complementarity and investigating whether the systemic governance of smart complementarities has a positive impact on sustainability. To this end, we employ a panel vector autoregression model with panel data for 26 smart cities from 2009 to 2019 to test the complex dynamic relationships between smart city drivers and dimensions of sustainability. Such analysis seems crucial for smart city governance and whether the vision of a smart agenda is compatible with urban sustainability. The findings suggest that while smart city initiatives have improved economic sustainability, they have compromised environmental and social sustainability. This points to the need for a coordinated approach to address the complexity of urban systems and sustainability challenges.

AB  - Canada is a sparsely populated country with its majority of population concentrated in cities, and its urbanization rate had risen to 80.2% by 2006. A similar environmental situation (air and water pollution, biodiversity degradation, high carbon emissions, et al.) in Canada has been going on in China and many of the developing countries during urbanization process. Based on ideas from urban planning and ecological development, Canada has taken a series of effective eco-measures, which contain urban heat island effect mitigation program, green infrastructure construction, and livable region strategic planning, to tackle with the environmental problems. The accumulated experience provides positive reference for China to find ways confronting climate change and obstacles of low carbon eco-city development, including: (1) Low carbon eco-city development mode, (2) Urban green infrastructure, (3) Urban ecological planning, and (4) Public participation.

AB  - Negative consequences of urban growing disparities usually lead to impressive levels of segregation, marginalization, and injustices, particularly in the context of climate change. Understanding the relations between urban expansion and social vulnerability has become extremely necessary for municipality management and sustainable urban development. Although the study of urbanization in Latin America (LA) has been well discussed, little attention has been given to how the population is affected by urban expansion-oriented movement after the 2008 economic crisis. Massive investments in infrastructure displaced the population to peripheral zones without adequate urban planning, which reflected in alteration in land use and land cover (LULC), followed by environmental impacts and public health issues caused by thermal discomfort, notably in semiarid regions. This paper aims to evaluate the effects of urban sprawl on the Teresina–Timon conurbation (TTC) area’s local population, located in Brazil’s northeast. Descriptive metrics (Moran’s I statistic and social vulnerability index) and orbital products derived from remote sensing—LULC and Land surface temperature (LST) maps—were applied. The results indicated that the housing program ‘My House My Life’ (PMCMV) had increased the values of land consumption per capita since 2009 significantly, showing a clear expanding trend. The gradual replacement of green areas by residential settlements resulted in an increased LST. The PMCMV program contributed substantially to a change in land use and land cover, which increased the extent of urbanized areas and changed the local microclimate.

AB  - The compact city approach has gained global impact as a planning approach for sustainable development in areas with increasing urban population. Through densification and compact building, the approach aims to counteract negative effects of urban sprawl in terms of ineffective land-use and related environmental problems. In spite of its benefits various problems and challenges are associated with implementing the compact city approach. This review looks at the effects of urban densification and compact city development on urban green space and its planning. It identifies problems, challenges and strategies of urban green space planning during densification processes. Findings confirm that urban densification processes, including consolidation and infill development, can pose a threat to urban green space. However, the literature on the compact city approach often lacks specific suggestions for urban green space conservation and planning. Provision of urban green space in compact city environments and during densification processes is described as a major challenge. Loss of private urban green space rarely seems offset by provision of more public green space. Several ways are identified to deal with these challenges, while also highlighting research gaps, e.g., as to how loss of green space quantity can be offset by increased green space quality.

AB  - For poverty-stricken mountainous cities in China, both poverty alleviation and ecological restoration projects are sources of land-use change in urban development. However, the patterns in changes are understudied in light of sustainable forest management. The study aims to explore the characteristics of land-use change in a poverty-stricken mountainous city with a focus on forests. This research proposed a three-step approach to explore the multi-aspect dynamics of land change, including the differences among land-use categories, spatial characteristics of urban expansion, and forest fragmentation. This study investigated Enshi City, China, based on land-use data from 2000, 2010, and 2020. Throughout the two intervals, the gain of water bodies and the loss of grassland were active. Artificial surfaces increased most intensively from 2010 to 2020, with transitions from grassland and cultivated land. Edge-expansion was the dominant type of artificial surface growth. Furthermore, forests had the largest size of gain across the two intervals, and there was a substantial reduction in forest fragmentation in the western part of the city. The findings confirm that recent planning measures are effective in restoring the natural environment. The identified key areas can support sustainable forest management in urban growth.

AB  - The ambitious targets of peaking CO2 emissions before 2030 and reaching carbon neutrality before 2060 (Goal 3060) have emerged as the driving force in the development of China's low-carbon energy policy. Adopting a systematic review approach, this article provides a timely analysis of key Chinese renewable energy and energy efficiency policies under Goal 3060 across five sectors: electricity, industry, transportation, buildings, and local governments. In addition, the review identifies challenges to be addressed and offers policy recommendations. There are five main conclusions: (1) expedite the development of market-based and network-based governance systems; (2) pursue the harmonization of policies by avoiding contradiction and fragmentation; (3) develop new policies, especially in the building and transportation sectors; (4) embrace surveillance technologies to improve implementation and compliance; and (5) ensure just transition by implementing policy to reduce the negative socioeconomic impacts on fossil fuels-based communities and workers. This review serves as a useful guide for scholars interested in China's clean and low-carbon energy transition.

AB  - If cities could become regenerative and adaptive urban ecosystems, in which resource loops were closed and waste was obsolete, their ecological footprint would diminish. In addition, urban resource security would increase, the health of urban populations would improve and urban greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced. These are the principle goals under-pinning the circular city. Circular cities emerge through the process of circular development. Circular development alters cities' systems of provision to enable circular practices of inhabitants to develop. This manifests as circular food systems and construction, water and nutrient recycling; adaptive reuse of spaces and pop-up activities; bioremediation of contaminated sites and integration of blue-green infrastructure throughout cities. To transform our cities will require significant investment, political support and public engagement. If the benefits of adopting such an approach can be identified, this will begin to make the case for support. The research presented in this paper draws on an inductive and deductive content analysis of relevant literature and interviews with those implementing circular projects in European cities (London, Paris, Amsterdam and Stockholm). It provides a clear definition of the normative concept of circular development. It creates a framework of benefits which are likely to accrue from adopting this approach. It points to the synergistic benefits emerging from circular development. It also highlights problems around valuation of those benefits, the unintended consequences of circular development and the inequalities in accessing benefits across society.

AB  - Circular economy strategies seek to reduce the total resources extracted from the environment and reduce the wastes that human activities generate in pursuit of human wellbeing. Circular Economy concepts are well suited to the building and construction sector in cities. For example, refurbishing and adaptively reusing underutilized or abandoned buildings can revitalize neighborhoods whilst achieving environmental benefits. Cultural heritage buildings hold a unique niche in the urban landscape. In addition to shelter, they embody the local cultural and historic characteristics that define communities. Therefore, extending their useful lifespan has multiple benefits that extend beyond the project itself to the surrounding area, contributing to economic and social development. To explore this complex issue, the research applies systematic literature review and synthesis methods. Decision makers lack knowledge of the environmental benefits of adaptive reuse of cultural heritage buildings and lack tools to implement these projects. A new comprehensive circular economy framework for the adaptive reuse of cultural heritage buildings to reduce environmental impacts intends to meet these needs. The framework integrates methods and techniques from the building and construction literature that aim to reduce lifecycle environmental impact of buildings with a circular product supply chain approach.

AB  - The paper deals with the issue of the regeneration of the existing building heritage by framing the problems that characterize the relationships between users-buildings-neighbourhoods in a circular vision. Circular Economy concepts are well suited to the building and construction sector in cities. For example, refurbishing and adaptively reusing underutilized or abandoned buildings can revitalize neighborhoods whilst achieving environmental benefits. A systematic review of the literature and case studies has led to the identification of three areas of action of the CE in the regeneration of the built environment: a Macro-level (the public space), a Micro-level (the single component), a Meso-level (the building). However, the traditional approach of carrying out timely interventions aimed at responding to individual problems, be they of a structural, energetic, functional nature, relating to the building, the context or the single component is not entirely effective in terms of reformulation of the building characteristics. In this perspective, the paper suggests strategies of circular regeneration of residential buildings through adaptive solutions at room level, home level and urban in pursuit of human wellbeing.

AB  - Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, understanding its impacts on cities has received much attention in science and policy circles. This paper systematically reviews the literature on the interface of the pandemic and urban sustainability. The objective is to portray the impacts brought by the COVID-19 outbreak in urban environments within the sustainability framework and to detect trends and challenges for future research. The paper follows a methodology that integrates both bibliometric and systematic review approaches. The first approach relies on bibliometric analysis to provide an overview of the landscape of main trends on this nexus. The second approach presents a content analysis that deepens the work by outlining the impacts of the pandemic and the challenges that emerged on five different key topics for urban sustainability. The role of resilient urban planning is discussed as an integrative concept to face diverse challenges in the construction of sustainable cities in a post-pandemic scenario. Likewise, the study deliberates on future research topics related to resilient urban planning, social equity, healthy urban environments, sustainable mobility, and circular economy. This review serves as a guide for researchers and urban planners to understand emerging challenges and future research trends in urban sustainability.

AB  - The rebound effect is a crucial and unresolved issue for the circular economy (CE) because it can deteriorate resource efficiency that has been improved by technologies. However, academic discussions on rebound effects mostly focus on environmental issues such as the material and energy rebound. Social aspects of rebound effects including radical organizational changes and damage to workers? and citizens? health and rights are relatively ignored. From the perspective of sustainable cities, it is necessary to take care of urban stakeholders and consider both environmental and social justice to prevent different dimensions of impact. Accordingly, this paper serves to broaden academic discourses on the circular economy rebound, proposes a framework to align CE with the context of sustainable cities, and clarifies the linkages between rebound effects and different phases of CE. It is concluded that policy makers should not solely emphasize numeric indicators of resource efficiency; instead, they should articulate the social context of rebound effects and address potential impact in advance to ensure sustainability. Via the integration of interdisciplinary knowledge, open information, and moral responsibility, CE stakeholders including relevant industries, governments, and communities can together establish more socially inclusive policies and regulations in a systematic manner for sustainable cities.

AB  - As awareness of climate change increases, U.S. cities are beginning to implement climate mitigation and adaptation initiatives to reduce population vulnerabilities to climate risks. This study contributes to a growing literature that quantitatively describes the relationships between sociodemographic variables and climate adaptation interventions in U.S. cities. Ordinary linear and simultaneous autoregressive models are used to evaluate early flood adaptation actions in Austin, Texas, to assess relationships between flood risk, green infrastructure, and measures of race and income. Findings of unequal exposure to flood risk and uneven access to flood resilience initiatives contribute to our understanding of color-blind urban planning responses to climate change and their potential to amplify inequitable protection from climate risks.

AB  - The political choices made by the European institutions in the last twenty years show how the conviction is increasingly rooted that the management of environmental problems and, more specifically, the fight against climate change can find a valid solution in technology and eco-innovations. This is evident starting from the last two growth strategies adopted (Europe 2020 and the European Green Deal), from the long series of measures implemented to put them into practice and from the main R&I funding programs, such as Horizon Europe. In this context, the problem of justice and inclusiveness of the various initiatives implemented is attracting growing attention. In fact, if the institutional documents assume that green and smart participated projects are also fair and inclusive, a growing body of literature based on empirical studies seems to refute this assumption. Within this framework, the present work analyses first the critical literature and then the three main preparatory documents for the Horizon Europe Mission Climate-neutral and Smart Cities, which selected 100 European cities to become climate-neutral by 2030. These have been studied through the lens of environmental justice, in order to assess the European Commission's understanding of the existing and arising equity issues in the path toward climate neutrality. The research shows that, while the first two documents seemed informed by the idea that participation automatically translates into equality, the last guidelines show a deeper acknowledgement of the multidimensional nature of environmental justice. One that, beyond participation, also considers issues of distribution, rights, responsibilities and recognition. The present work should nevertheless be understood as a preparatory, analytical tool that will require the further definition and implementation of Climate City Contracts by the selected cities, in order to assess how the issue of environmental justice is effectively being considered in each specific context.

AB  - Access to modern energy services in households is central to achieving decent living standards and wellbeing. Almost 3 billion people in Sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia still lack access to modern energy services and endure energy consumption rates equivalent to a fraction of that in developed countries. While critical for the successful achievement of several internationally agreed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), closing this energy divide may pose an additional pressure on the already daunting challenge of securing climate stabilization. The ways in which this divide is closed will significantly affect the development of buildings-related emissions. This paper revisits previous work on the potential conflict between efforts towards closing the energy divide and enabling the achievement of higher levels of human well-being, and those associated with climate stabilization. It estimates the additional energy needed to achieve the former in terms of final energy consumption levels in key regions, and the associated emission pathways under different climate action scenarios. It then analyses the impact that such pathways could have on estimated carbon budgets associated with fulfilling the Paris Agreement, and provides some suggestions on how this impact could be minimized in the buildings sector.

AB  - 120 years or more of unsustainable urban development has damaged the natural environment and disrupted essential ways to stabilize water body overflow and even mitigate pluvial flooding. In light of catastrophic flooding that has occurred globally, a renewed commitment to transforming built surfaces and incorporating more green infrastructures (GIs) has emerged. In fact, one could argue that an overcommitment to GI is being touted in the literature, but largely disconnected from more real-world possibilities, considering all things. In this commentary, we make the case that as cities transition from development patterns of the past and even considering climate-induced storm characteristics of the future, a hybridized solution (e.g., Green-Gray) should be considered. Smaller approaches to urban greening have been implemented in areas that need larger-scale restorations, thus proving to be insufficient. Likewise, the uncertainty surrounding rainfall and storm events has forced us to be more strategically balanced in our efforts to achieve resilience in our stormwater infrastructure. Hybridized solutions that include a diverse set of systems, anchored in local conditions, position us best for effective urban stormwater management. In the absence of such solutions, runoff volumes will continue to rise, flooding will prevail, and disenfranchised communities will remain disproportionately impacted by these impacts of urbanization.

AB  - Community-led land ownership can contribute to environmental justice in disaster-prone areas, particularly as it protects vulnerable communities from market-driven displacement often occurring after natural disasters. The article reviews literature linking the climate emergency with disaster resilience and collective land-based models. It brings into focus the case of the Cano Martin Pena communities in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where residents started a Community Land Trust (CLT) in Latin America and the Caribbean, resulting from an extensive process of community participation. We highlight the importance of this case as still one of the only CLT's in the Global South, a mechanism not yet sufficiently understood as a highly developed instrument for secure land tenure and adaptation to climate change in the Global South. We analyse the mechanisms by which the CLT's collective tenure model effectively ensures greater environmental justice - both regarding ongoing flooding issues, and specific extreme natural events such as hurricanes. Collective land ownership allows residents to remain in the area despite forces of gentrification and displacement after disasters induced by global warming. We conclude with a reflection on the need for similar land-based solutions, and summon public authorities to consider these as a route to effective environmental management.

AB  - Conservation and regeneration approaches on existing buildings are the result of a system of attributes and values recognized by the human culture, which results in a framework of rules and practices that differ in different contexts. In the contemporary condition marked by the paradigm of sustainability, conservation planning is required to face the challenges of climate change, through the promotion of circular development and social inclusion, as well as the protection of ecosystems and biodiversity. The circular economy, which is based on the principles of recovery, recycling, reuse and sharing, in line with the sustainable development goals of the 2030 Agenda, offers the opportunity to rethink development models, in urban areas and beyond. Within this framework, the study proposes a systematization of the literature review which classifies taxonomies of values and methods to assess sustainability and circularity in urban planning and design at different urban scales. The proposed conceptual scheme is the first step for the definition of a new system of values of the existing building stock, which prove to be fundamental to guide urban transformations in the Green New Deal.

AB  - Despite decade old calls for a "just sustainability,'' urban sustainability policy and practice remains oriented toward environmental outcomes and eco-lifestyle projects. Notions of equity, justice, and inclusion continue to be marginalized in favor of technological solutions, such as green buildings, that are visible, easy to implement, and help to promote economic development. By examining a controversy over a bikeway development project in a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood in Northeast Portland, Oregon, this article explores how despite apolitical appeals to broadly shared values or visions of what a sustainable city ought to look like, sustainability projects can be-and perhaps should be-hotly contested. This article illustrates how sustainable development projects become sites of political debate, and provide space for environmental and social justice concerns to enter into the broader discourse on sustainability. Following the work of environmental justice advocates and scholars critiquing urban sustainability, this article contributes to the analysis and practice of efforts to advance a more socially robust, equitable, and political notion of sustainability.

AB  - The construction industry plays an essential role in a country's economic growth. The industry has been criticised for activities and processes that generate high volumes of waste, whilst obstructing sustainable development goal (SDGs) targets. The circular economy (CE) increases waste minimisation by keeping materials and resources in a closed loop. This concept has continued to gain positive traction as a potential solution to achieve sustainable development. The authors argue that contextualising the circular economy (CE) as part of the discourse towards implementing the United Nations (UN) SDGs Agenda 2030 is crucial for managing the increasing amounts of waste generated by the construction industry. This paper provides a framework that establishes a detailed relationship between the SDGs, construction waste management and the CE to direct future sustainable development research, policies, and innovations. The study adopted a narrative literature review methodology. Scopus and Web of Science were scoured for relevant literature published between 2015 and 2021. Initially 65 articles were identified with this number being reduced to 24 following a detailed inspection of their applicability to the study. The findings from the articles were summarized, synthesized, and incorporated into the study. A key theme that emerged was that an understanding of the SDGs-circular economy linkages in construction waste management is integral to establishing long-term innovative solutions for developing multi-sectorial measures for waste prevention, eco-design, and re-use of materials. These linkages increase competitiveness, stimulate innovation, and boost economic growth. This study proposes that all stakeholders who generate waste should apply new innovative technologies, methods and strategies leading to transdisciplinary and transformative change.

AB  - Theory formulation is crucial in search of a genuine panacea on Solid Waste Management Disposal. The study aims to catenate the different theories in Solid Waste Management to be able to re-craft a theoretical framework for Sustainable Cities. A qualitative research method was applied to consolidate and synthesize the fragmented theories on Urban Ecology, Policy Making, Eco-Innovations, Triple-Bottom Line, Waste Management and Sustainability. Formulation of policy and implementation instruments is vital tool to reinvent Waste Management Theory. Wastes disposal is a global phenomenon. As a result of theoretical analysis, urban transformation amidst economic development poses environmental degradation. Progress is inevitable, hence urban transformation occurs. The upward pressure from economic development creates downward pressure on environmental degradation. This condition when exhibited longer than necessary, stagnation proliferates and cities turned into an ecological sacrificial zone. To mitigate, formulation of policy instruments as government sticks must transpire. And at the end of the spectrum, regulations and policies embodied in the implementation instruments based on Waste Management Theory must be supported by eco-innovations. These innovations inclusive of new ideas, new behavior, processes, and products in sync in a Waste Management Program measured through environmental preservation/restoration, economic resilience, and social wellbeing commonly called as the "Triple bottom-line". Thereafter, the metamorphosis of cities from the ecological sacrifice zone into sustainable cities will transpire.

AB  - PurposeThe environmental assessment of urban mobility, defined as the movement of people in an urban area, exceeds the scope of transportation life cycle assessment (LCA) with spatial, territorial and even social considerations. The objective of this study is to develop an original interdisciplinary method based on LCA coupled with a land use and transport interaction (LUTI) model to better consider spatial and territorial dimensions in an environmental assessment of urban mobility.MethodsSpatial and territorial issues emerge in all LCA stages for urban mobility, and this study illustrates them with an application on the Lyon urban area. To consider most individual daily trips, the geographical boundary is related to the area of influence of the city and the functional boundary includes all transportation modes, with motorized, public and non-motorized transports. The life cycle inventories (LCIs) combined EcoInvent 3.2 inventories with a specific LUTI model, named SIMBAD, local mobility surveys and an emissions and consumptions model (COPERT5). These refinements allow a spatial environmental impacts assessment of urban mobility, expressed per inhabitant per day, at different residential locations and open opportunities to develop precise assessment methods for local air pollutants with detailed description on both population and pollution concentrations.Results and discussionAt territorial scale, this study highlights the major contribution to environmental impacts from private cars (around 90%) and the relevance to consider fuel, vehicle, and infrastructure life cycles in a mobility assessment. Spatial interpretations show important variability in function of residential locations and urban form characteristics related to different mobility behaviours, distance travelled and transport technologies used. Through the proposed assessment method for local air pollution impacts on human health, hotspots are revealed in the urban area, especially in the urban centre or along main road axes. In order to test our methodology and open discussions on mobility solutions, two contrasted scenarios are explored on compact city and vehicle electrification both presenting impact transfers between global indicators or with the air pollution exposure indicator.ConclusionsUrban mobility and its related environmental burden are not only related to technological choices but are also related to spatial characteristics and territorial context. The combination of urban and spatial tools and data, such as LUTI model, with the LCA methodology improves the local representativeness of environmental assessment of mobility and enlarges the ranges of analysis and perspective. Nonetheless, improvements remain to be made in relation to ongoing developments on spatialized and territorial LCA.

AB  - Economic pressure on agricultural land is generating major changes in affected territorial systems. The development of methodologies to analyze the pressure on agricultural land is one of the main concerns regarding food security and how to provide fresh produce to large cities. The methodology used uses the Corine Land Cover database, provided by Copernicus Land Monitoring Services (CLMS), from 1990–2018. Data processing and analysis was performed using the open-source software package QGIS, a process that started by reprojecting the data into the national coordinate reference system Pulkovo 1942(58)/Stereo 70, EPSG: 3844. The methodology used was able to highlight the transformations that have taken place in land use, highlighting when and how the land was transformed. Our results show that quantitative and land-use changes due to the socio-economic pressures generated by the transition to a different type of economy can be highlighted. Urban sprawl has led to dramatic changes in land use, with agricultural land being the category that has seen the largest reductions in area.

AB  - The building and construction sector accounts for around 39% of global carbon dioxide emissions and remains a hard-to-abate sector. We use a data-driven analysis of global high-level climate action on emissions reduction in the building sector using 256,717 English-language tweets across a 13-year time frame (2009–2021). Using natural language processing and network analysis, we show that public sentiments and emotions on social media are reactive to these climate policy actions. Between 2009–2012, discussions around green building-led emission reduction efforts were highly influential in shaping the online public perceptions of climate action. From 2013 to 2016, communication around low-carbon construction and energy efficiency significantly influenced the online narrative. More significant interactions on net-zero transition, climate tech, circular economy, mass timber housing and climate justice in 2017–2021 shaped the online climate action discourse. We find positive sentiments are more prominent and recurrent and comprise a larger share of the social media conversation. However, we also see a rise in negative sentiment by 30–40% following popular policy events like the IPCC report launches, the Paris Agreement and the EU Green Deal. With greater online engagement and information diffusion, social and environmental justice topics emerge in the online discourse. Continuing such shifts in online climate discourse is pivotal to a more just and people-centric transition in such hard-to-decarbonise sectors.

AB  - Electrification is an efficient way to decarbonize by replacing fossil fuels with low-emission power. In addition, energy efficiency measures can reduce consumption, making it easier to shift to a zero-carbon society. In Quebec, upgrades to aging buildings that employ electric resistance heating offer a unique opportunity to free up large amounts of hydroelectricity that can serve to decarbonize heating in other buildings. However, another source of energy would be needed to electrify mobility because efficiency measures free up small amounts of electricity in summer compared to winter. This study reveals how building efficiency measures combined with solar electricity generation provide an energy profile that matches the requirements for decarbonizing both mobility and heating. The TRNSYS software was used to simulate the annual energy performance of an existing house and retrofitted/rebuilt low-energy houses equipped with a photovoltaic (PV) roof in Montreal, Quebec, Canada (45.5 & DEG; N). The electricity that is made available by upgrading the houses is mainly considered for powering battery and fuel cell electric vehicles (BEVs and FCEVs) and electrifying heating in greenhouses. The results indicate that retrofitting 16% or rebuilding 12% of single-detached homes in Quebec can provide enough electricity to decarbonize heating energy use in existing greenhouses and to operate the new greenhouses required for growing all fresh vegetables locally. If all the single-detached houses that employ electric resistance heating are upgraded, 33.4 and 21.8 TWh year(-1) of electricity would be available for decarbonization, equivalent to a 19% and 12% increase of the province's electricity supply for the retrofitted or rebuilt houses, respectively. This is enough energy to convert 83-100% of personal vehicles to BEVs or 35-56% to FCEVs. Decarbonization using the electricity that is made available by upgrading to low-energy solar houses could reduce the province's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by approximately 32% (26.5 MtCO(2eq)). The time required for the initial embodied GHG emissions to surpass the emissions avoided by electrification ranges from 3.4 to 11.2 years. Building energy efficiency retrofits/rebuilds combined with photovoltaics is a promising approach for Quebec to maximize the decarbonization potential of its existing energy resources while providing local energy and food security.

AB  - Urban sociology and urban studies increasingly employ the idea of sustainability to explain, analyze, and critique city redevelopment. While the ambiguous and oxymoronic nature of sustainability goals has been extensively covered in the past, the current resurgence and popularity of the term "sustainability," especially under the aegis of "urban sustainability" or "green" cities, requires us to rethink the usefulness of sustainability as a concept for understanding and evaluating urban redevelopment. Confronting this challenge, this article reviews three of the most common theoretical approaches to sustainability, problematizes those approaches in the context of North American cities, and then provides a working definition of urban sustainability. Finally, the article recommends four plausible research hypotheses to guide future research on urban sustainability.

AB  - Green spaces in urban areas-like remnant habitat, parks, constructed wetlands, and street trees-supply multiple benefits. Many studies show green spaces in and near urban areas play important roles harbouring biodiversity and promoting human well-being. On the other hand, evidence suggests that greater human population density enables compact, low-carbon cities that spare habitat conversion at the fringes of expanding urban areas, while also allowing more walkable and livable cities. How then can urban areas have abundant green spaces as well as density? In this paper, we review the empirical evidence for the relationships between urban density, nature, and sustainability. We also present a quantitative analysis of data on urban tree canopy cover and open space for United States large urbanized areas, as well as an analysis of non-US Functional Urban Areas in OECD countries. We found that there is a negative correlation between population density and these green spaces. For Functional Urban Areas in the OECD, a 10% increase in density is associated with a 2.9% decline in tree cover. We argue that there are competing trade-offs between the benefits of density for sustainability and the benefits of nature for human well-being. Planners must decide an appropriate density by choosing where to be on this trade-off curve, taking into account city-specific urban planning goals and context. However, while the negative correlation between population density and tree cover is modest at the level of US urbanized areas (R2 = 0.22), it is weak at the US Census block level (R2 = 0.05), showing that there are significant brightspots, neighbourhoods that manage to have more tree canopy than would be expected based upon their level of density. We then describe techniques for how urban planners and designers can create more brightspots, identifying a typology of urban forms and listing green interventions appropriate for each form. We also analyse policies that enable these green interventions illustrating them with the case studies of Curitiba and Singapore. We conclude that while there are tensions between density and urban green spaces, an urban world that is both green and dense is possible, if society chooses to take advantage of the available green interventions and create it.

AB  - Household relocation choices are critical in shaping urban socio-economic landscapes, especially within the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This study investigates the complex factors influencing household relocation decisions in Kumasi, Ghana, an urban center undergoing rapid growth. The aim is to understand how socio-economic conditions, environmental challenges, and urban policy dynamics interact to shape relocation intentions. Using a qualitative approach, this research use qualitative interviews and natural language processing (NLP) technique to capture the diverse push and pull factors motivating relocation. Findings indicate that push factors, such as inadequate housing, urban congestion, and environmental degradation, diminish quality of life and drive relocation. Conversely, pull factors, including employment opportunities, access to education and healthcare, and enhanced urban amenities, attract households to particular areas within Kumasi. This study situates these relocation dynamics within the SDG framework, highlighting the need for sustainable urban development strategies that address residents' aspirations and challenges. The results emphasize that aligning urban planning with principles of inclusivity, equity, and environmental sustainability can enhance urban resilience and community well-being. The study's insights are valuable for policymakers, urban planners, and stakeholders seeking to foster urban environments conducive to sustainable development, equitable growth, and social inclusion, ultimately advancing progress toward achieving the SDGs.

AB  - In Togo, the cities of Lomé and Kara are undergoing rapid urbanisation driven by strong population growth and the expansion of urban built-up areas, leading to significant reductions in urban green spaces (UGSs). UGSs are vital for climate regulation and human well-being by mitigating urban heat, improving air quality, and supporting mental health. This urban expansion directly replaces vegetated areas with impervious surfaces, diminishing UGS and their associated ecosystem services. Consequently, climatic vulnerability has increased, highlighting the need for sustainable urban development and UGS conservation. This study examines UGS spatiotemporal dynamics using Landsat imagery from 1988, 2000, 2012, and 2022, applying a supervised image classification approach with the maximum likelihood algorithm. Post-classification change detection quantified UGS loss. Additionally, vulnerability models for 2022, 2060, and 2100 were developed using Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP 2.45 and SSP 5.85) and a multifactorial modelling approach. The results reveal a decline in UGSs from 85.98% to 40.78% in Lomé and from 93.99% to 36.68% in Kara between 1988 and 2022, primarily due to urbanisation. Vulnerable zones, currently in UGSs, risk disappearance by 2060–2100, exacerbating climate risks. Urgent measures are needed, including conservation policies, UGS creation, and community awareness to promote urban sustainability.

AB  - A plethora of terms have emerged connecting various sustainability and climate-resilience initiatives to gentrification: green, environmental, eco-, ecological, climate, carbon and resilience gentrification. We conducted a systematic literature review of these seven terms to identify how they have been defined and applied over time. We discuss the importance of considering the nuance each term has uncovered but emphasize the need to theorize back across all seven terms to further our understanding of the current state of gentrification. Our research indicates that green, environmental, eco-, and ecological gentrification overlap significantly to describe the impact of a wide range of sustainability and resilience initiatives but differ somewhat in the drivers and discourses to which they have been defined and applied. Climate and resilience gentrification have recently been defined as subtypes of the first four terms to specifically highlight the role of climate impacts and adaptation measures, while carbon gentrification focuses on 'grey' initiatives aimed at reducing carbon emissions. We use the term 'sustainability gentrification' to encompass what all seven terms have in common-the role of climate change, and use of sustainability/resilience-building responses to it, in the production of space for progressively affluent users.

AB  - Economic growth plays an important role in the rapid increase in construction of transportation and bridge infrastructures, which in turn causes enormous greenhouse gas emissions contributing directly to climate change. An innovative and effective method, so-called Building Information Modeling (BIM), to sustainably manage detailed lifecycle of infrastructures, has been recently adopted to revolutionise the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. Its major function is to sustainably optimise all detailed stages of an infrastructure asset’s lifecycle. A three-dimensional architectural BIM incorporating three additional dimensions (time, cost, and carbon emissions) has then been created in this study to virtualise the whole lifecycle performance of bridge infrastructure through BIM data. For circular asset management, multi-scale details of assets and infrastructures are indispensable. On this ground, these information dimensions are highly critical to asset managers to assure not only public safety, but also sustainability over the whole lifecycle. It is thus critical to quantify carbon footprint in order to identify better alternative solutions for construction and maintenance, resulting in carbon neutrality and carbon credit. Our digital twin (DT), driven by the BIM, has embedded demolition scenarios whose lifecycle cost and carbon footprint can be quantified and optimized simultaneously. Our study is the first to also demonstrate circular end-of-life management through strategic demolition planning that enhances circular economy practice. This aspect is novel and has not been commonly adopted in practice. Our study reveals that the construction stage of the asset lifecycle for this study is the main contributor to carbon emissions and costs stemming from raw materials and their productions. This eventually leads to significant waste at the end of asset’s life, requiring strategic demolition plan to maximise reuse, repurpose, and recycle of materials, parts and components. Our innovative DT is capable of dealing with the cradle-to-cradle lifecycle management. Another co-benefit of using the BIM-based digital twin is to minimise streamlining design, re-work, mitigating risk, and real time processing of design changes in all stakeholders, reducing the effect on carbon emissions, costs, and time schedules. All dimensions (i.e. 6D) can be updated and re-calculated in real time when cross-linked with inspections and condition monitoring, generating real-time digital twin driven solutions.

AB  - Technology is increasingly reshaping social relations and transforming associated urban spatial configurations. Advancements such as digital social platforms and mobile apps have helped to connect social actors, empower citizens, and enable diverse circular economy practices in cities. Paradoxically, technology is also contributing to loneliness, anxiety, and depression among urban populations, and raises nuanced questions about access and inclusivity in increasingly digitized urban settings. In this contribution, we consider the possibilities and challenges inherent in applying digital technologies to leverage the development of inclusive and diverse circular economic spaces around a city's reuse, repair and recycling infrastructure and drive socio-ecological transformations of urban spaces. We conclude that uneven access to digital tools potentially reinforces existing urban social inequalities, and that emphasis must be placed on understanding how technologies should be more effectively designed and leveraged for a socially inclusive circular economy in the city.

AB  - The purpose of this research paper is to investigate and identify the factors which can support the development of one characteristic of smart cities, namely, the smart environment. More specifically, the main goal is to measure the extent to which air pollution may be reduced, taking as determinants several circular economy, fiscal, and environmental factors. The Ordinary Least Squares, the Fixed Effects, and Random Effects regression models using balanced panel data were employed, over the 2011–2019 period, for 28 European states. After rigorously studying the literature, 11 indicators with a predictable impact on the exposure to air pollution were kept. According to current analysis, the most effective methods of reducing air pollution are the use of renewable energy, the investments in educating the population to reduce pollution, the proper implementation of the circular economy, and the adoption of the most suitable policies by the European Union governments. Particular attention needs to be paid to factors such as carbon dioxide-generating activities, which are significantly increasing the air pollution. Another strong value is that of providing information on the assessment of ambient air quality, and on the promotion of appropriate policies to achieve two major objectives: well-being, and sustainable cities.

AB  - Urbanization has been responsible for the loss of cropland worldwide, especially in China. To guarantee national food security, China has implemented a series of policies to protect cropland. One of these policies requires that one-hectare cropland should be reclaimed when urban expansion occupies one-hectare cropland. Since most cropland reclamation leads to a conversion of natural habitat, such as wetland and grassland, urban expansion may lead to (indirect) natural habitat loss in addition to direct loss from conversion of into urban area. While several studies assessed the direct habitat loss resulted from built-up area expansion, few studies investigated the indirect losses caused by cropland displacement. In this paper, a model based approach is applied to explore both direct and indirect impacts of built-up area expansion on natural habitat loss for the city of Wuhan, China, between 2010 and 2020 using different scenarios. Our scenarios differ in the implementation of strict cropland protection policies and ecosystem conservation strategies. Results show that the indirect loss of natural habitat due to cropland displacement under strict cropland protection policies far outweighs the direct loss due to built-up area expansion alone. Moreover, we found that ecosystem conservation strategies mainly influence the type of natural habitat that is affected, while the total amount of natural habitat loss remains relatively constant.

AB  - The construction and building materials (CBMs) production industries, such as cement, steel, and plastics that are responsible for a substantial share of global CO2 emissions, face increasing pressure to decarbonize. Recent legislative initiatives like the United States (US) federal Buy Clean Initiative and the World Green Building Council's decarbonization plan for Europe highlight the urgency to reduce emissions during CBM production stages. However, there remains a gap in addressing the localized environmental and social impacts of these industries as well as a necessary understanding of how decarbonization efforts may change local impacts. This study introduces a framework for quantifying the disproportionate impacts (Id) of 12 CBM production facility categories on communities of color and low-income demographics across the US. Using geographical and environmental data from the 2017 US National Emissions Inventory (NEI), we assess these impacts at four spatial scales: census tract, county, state, and national. Results show that across all scales, many CBM production facilities impose disproportionate impacts. The geographical disproportionate impact (IG,d) shows the greatest burdens at the broadest spatial scales, whereas the environmental disproportionate impact (IE,d) indicates highest burdens at more localized levels. Based on this spatial understanding, we provide methods that can be implemented to support community engagement and mitigate damages to populations neighboring industrial materials manufacturing. These findings offer valuable insights into the relationship between facility locations, emissions, and demographic groups, providing a basis for more targeted environmental justice policies aimed at mitigating these disproportionate impacts.

We adopt an ecological economics lens to expose the limitations of the urban resource efficiency paradigm when tackling environmental degradation beyond city boundaries. Based on the interpretation of urbanisation as a material practice, we urge for a fundamental recalibration of sustainability paradigms in urban planning. To integrate the impacts of urbanisation on non-urban landscapes within the framework of urban sustainability science, we furthermore stress the urgent need for frugality, resource reduction, and inclusiveness in urban planning practice.

AB  - To contribute to the debate on the relationship between regeneration and urban morphology, the illustrated study seeks to understand how the prediction of new multi-scale, multidimensional and integrated planning tools based on sustainable and resilient strategies, can guarantee high levels of urban, environmental, energy efficiency and resource circularity quality, counteracting the effects of climate change, landscape-environmental degradation and socio-economic marginality. Starting from the analysis of the complex socio-political framework and from some design and regulatory references that integrate in planning, a new model of ecologically oriented city, the contribution identifies in the enhancement of drosscapes as a new design metaphor that can improve biodiversity, encourage ecological and energy transition, restore, with natural solutions, the quality of air environmental matrices, water and soil, triggering a new urban metabolism. Through the application of an iterative and interscalar methodology articulated in levels and phases to a study area lying in the Roman suburbs and subjected to the procedure of the urban project, the contribution proposes a reflection on the need to implement design strategies capable of counteracting dissipative dynamics, building resilient landscapes, sustainable energy cycles within ecological regeneration scenarios, morphological reconfiguration of urban fabrics and public spaces related to the promotion of an efficient city, smart and green. In this perspective, it highlights the potential and limits of the proposed experimentation, both in terms of the quality and innovativeness of the design solutions, and in terms of possible evolutionary lines that could raise the levels of settlement and environmental quality, of social inclusion and economic growth.

We elaborate upon the manner in which job access affects economic and social sustainability and focus on tradeoffs between the two. We measure and characterize the impact of job access on housing prices and the spatial distribution of disadvantaged populations across New York City, using census data. Results document not only that there are significant positive effects of job access on housing but also that higher housing prices screen out disadvantaged populations and undermine social equity. Findings highlight the paradox in sustainable development that job access seldom exhibits simultaneous positive effects on economic and social equity. We propose that urban built environment might have sigificantimpact on and might be a solution to the tension between economic benefits and social loss regarding job accessibility. That is, appropriate spatial land use planning and public policies could maximize individual welfare and sustainability for future cities-a new perspective of achieving urban sustainability. The major challenge is finding a workable balance between economic and social sustainability that is theoretically sound and empirically feasible.

AB  - Single-family detached homes-the lowest-density housing type-continue to dominate the U.S. home construction industry. These homes are carbon-intensive and automobile dependent; the built environments they produce militate against civic relations and attitudes. Cities need to increase density, support multimodality, and develop social capital, but these issues are not propelling cities to diversify their housing stock. The objective of this research is to facilitate this shift by establishing economic arguments for increased density and housing diversity. Municipal-level U.S. Census data is used to explore the interurban relationships between diversity in housing stocks and unemployment rates in 146 mid-size American cities. A measure of diversity, Shannon's H, is applied to housing stock and found to be strongly associated with lower unemployment for workers over 25 years old after controlling for measures of urban social burden. In contrast to the much-heralded "trade-offs" between environmental quality, social equity, and economic development, these findings suggest that the dense, walkable, low-carbon city, and the economically sustainable city might be the same place.

AB  - Urbanization disrupts landscapes and ecosystem functions, which poses threats to biodiversity, social systems, and human health, particularly among vulnerable populations. Urban land-use planners are faced with competing demands for housing, safety, transportation, and economic development and often lack tools to integrate these with protecting environmental functions. We identify three major barriers to integrating the benefits that flow with connected, functioning ecosystems into land-use planning. The lack of a shared language among planners and stakeholders poses a barrier to the restoration and preservation of ecological features. Methods of incorporating the benefits from connectivity are not standardized because values are not readily available or lack credibility. Ecological restoration tends to be poorly coordinated at broad scales, and thus often fails to achieve landscape-level objectives. To address these challenges, we developed a novel integrated framework, the Connectivity Benefits Framework (CBF), which combines the benefits from three categories of ecosystem connectivity with benefit-and risk-relevant indicators, enabling both monetary and non-monetary valuation of benefits. Moreover, it provides a method to identify and visualize the multiple and overlapping benefits from management actions to aid in prioritizing initiatives that support ecosystem functions. Unlike software tools that incorporate generalized values of ecosystem services at a landscape level, the CBF guides a systematic approach to community-engaged land-use planning that prioritizes localized societal needs while protecting biodiversity and ecosystem function for more equitable, resilient cities. We demonstrate the potential for multiple overlapping benefits from actions that restore and protect ecosystem connectivity by applying the framework to a transit planning project in Portland, Oregon.

AB  - Nature-based solutions have not been able to actively involve citizens and to address successfully food security, poverty alleviation, and inequality in urban areas. The Edible City approach promises a strategic step towards the development of sustainable, livable, and healthy cities. We introduce the conceptional framework of Edible City Solutions (ECS), including different forms of urban farming combined with closed loop systems for sustainable water, nutrient, and waste management. We review scientific evidence on ECS benefits for urban regeneration and describe the status quo of ECS in Rotterdam, Andernach, Oslo, Heidelberg, and Havana as case studies. We provide an analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) to explore the capacity of ECS to enhance multifunctionality of urban landscapes with special focus on social cohesion and quality of life. Based on this we identify and discuss strategies for fostering socially relevant implementations for the case study cities and beyond.

AB  - From an academic perspective, compact land use and spatial development patterns are regarded as the primary aspects of urban development for environmental sustainability and government financing. However, whether these aspects concur with residents' perceived quality of life is unclear. Because of differences in spatial structures, residents in sprawling and compact development areas differ in their perceptions and levels of satisfaction regarding quality of life. Identifying the characteristics of and differences among quality of life perceptions can facilitate the clarification of whether sustainable development and growth management fit the expectations of urban residents. This study examined the Taipei metropolitan area. In the survey, questionnaire copies were distributed to residents in sprawling and compact development areas. Structural equation modeling was applied to the collected data to explore the differences in residents' perceptions of and satisfaction with quality of life. The study findings revealed that street space, commercial functions, neighborhood relationships, and household finances were four aspects exerting a significant effect on residents' perceptions of and satisfaction with overall quality of life in sprawling development areas. Living space, commercial functions, neighborhood relationships, and household finances were significant factors influencing residents' satisfaction with quality of life in compact development areas.

AB  - Based on the remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) analysis of the Landsat multispectral scanner (MSS) and thematic mapper (TM) satellite images of 1983, 1993, and 2005, the present research examined the effectiveness of the urban construction boundaries (UCBs) in containing urban growth within the 6th Ring Road of Beijing Municipality. Three indicators on boundary control were proposed, through which the effectiveness of boundary containment, land inventory sufficiency and illegal adjacent development to the UCBs were explored. The results suggested that, first, the UCBs were limited in effectiveness in containing urban growth; second, the area encompassed by the UCBs might not be designed large enough to accommodate new development. The frustration of the urban growth control through the UCBs mainly resulted from the lack of a transparent system for urban land use planning and control to provide sufficient information, the limitation of the traditional land use prediction method to consider contingencies, and the absence of a mechanism to monitor and adjust the UCBs to respond just in time to urban change.

AB  - The transition to more circular practices in the construction sector offers an alternative to linear processes that are highly polluting and wasteful. Recent life cycle assessment (LCA) studies emphasize the relevance of the end-of-life scenario, highlighting its potential for impact reduction through circular strategies. There is an urgent need to fill the knowledge gap in the LCA literature on reducing the environmental impacts of affordable housing. Whole-building LCAs of three affordable homes built using a variety of lightweight construction methods in the southern United States were conducted to examine the environmental impacts of commonly used construction solutions for single-family affordable housing in the southern US and assess the extent to potential environmental impact mitigation through the introduction of additional circular strategies or the use of regenerative materials. In addition to the conventional as-built scenario, five hypothetical scenarios were considered in this study to evaluate the influence of different end-of-life options, namely, reduced recycling rates, increased recycling or reuse rates, and substitution of conven-tional insulation or finish materials with equivalent options from regenerative sources. The study aims to identify further opportunities for and limits to impact mitigation. The results show that the design and construction priorities should be (1) promoting proper end-of-life strategies for metals and wood-based materials, (2) replacing non-renewable materials with renewable wood or earth materials, and (3) increasing the reuse rate of materials and diverting construction waste. The study findings will support decision-making processes concerning the design and construc-tion of low-impact affordable single-family homes and the development and implementation of affordable housing policies and regulations, resulting in greater environmental justice and a more equitable and sustainable built environment.

AB  - The increasing population across the globe makes it essential to link smart and sustainable city planning with the logistics of transporting people and goods, which will significantly contribute to how societies will face mobility in the coming years. The concept of smart mobility emerged with the popularity of smart cities and is aligned with the sustainable development goals defined by the United Nations. A reduction in traffic congestion and new route optimizations with reduced ecological footprint are some of the essential factors of smart mobility; however, other aspects must also be taken into account, such as the promotion of active mobility and inclusive mobility, encouraging the use of other types of environmentally friendly fuels and engagement with citizens. The Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain and Big Data technology will serve as the main entry points and fundamental pillars to promote the rise of new innovative solutions that will change the current paradigm for cities and their citizens. Mobility-as-a-service, traffic flow optimization, the optimization of logistics and autonomous vehicles are some of the services and applications that will encompass several changes in the coming years with the transition of existing cities into smart cities. This paper provides an extensive review of the current trends and solutions presented in the scope of smart mobility and enabling technologies that support it. An overview of how smart mobility fits into smart cities is provided by characterizing its main attributes and the key benefits of using smart mobility in a smart city ecosystem. Further, this paper highlights other various opportunities and challenges related to smart mobility. Lastly, the major services and applications that are expected to arise in the coming years within smart mobility are explored with the prospective future trends and scope.

AB  - At a time of great urgency for transitions to sustainability in light of climate mitigation targets, energy infrastructure is in a state of flux. Expansions in renewable energy and the persistent grasp of fossil fuels over a historically centralised sector surface new challenges of socio-spatial and environmental justice. Where does new energy infrastructure appear, how is this decided, who benefits and who is burdened? What land uses are displaced and with what socio-ecological implications? This collection pulls together insights from environmental and land governance, ethnographic studies of situated social identities, and emerging conceptualisations of energy infrastructure to address these concerns. It features contributions focused at multiple scales - the urban, regional, national and trans-local - and informed by a variety of cognate conceptual lenses: political ecology, human geography, social anthropology, urban studies, socio-technical transitions and epistemic politics. Examining cases from three continents, both the Global South and North, the theme issue presents an array of perspectives from established and emerging scholars. It seeks to combine empirically rich and theoretically rigorous enquiry at the conjuncture of energy infrastructure transitions, changing land use and morphing social identity. The aim is thus to further interdisciplinary knowledge on socio-ecological implications of cross-sectoral transitions.

AB  - Energy poverty has become a significant global challenge, especially in China, the largest developing country, where the problem of energy poverty is more complex and diverse than that of developed countries. In this study, a Multidimensional Energy Poverty Index (MEPI) was constructed from three dimensions: energy-use level, structure, and capacity. Social welfare is quantified using the regional Development and Living Index (DLI) and the spatial effect of MEPI on social welfare is explored using a spatial Durbin model. The findings indicate that energy poverty has a detrimental impact on local and surrounding areas' social welfare. The energy-use level poverty has the most pronounced negative spillover effect, followed by the energy-use structure poverty, while the energy-use capacity poverty has the weakest impact. Strategies such as high-efficiency energy structure and formal environmental regulation, can mitigate local welfare challenges. Moreover, low-carbon energy structure can mitigate surrounding areas' welfare challenges. Additionally, the welfare effects of informal regulation and technological innovation have yet to be fully realized. Based on these conclusions, we provide recommendations to policy-makers on how to alleviate energy poverty and promote sustainable development. These include increasing funding for renewable energy projects in the central and western regions, promoting energy efficiency and consumption management in urban and industrial areas, enforcing environmental protection laws, fostering green technology innovation, and enhancing cooperation among regions.

AB  - Cultural heritage can play a strategic role in developing a sustainable built environment, contributing to the improvement of the economic, social, and environmental productivity of a city. Human activities are constantly affecting the quality of the environment and altering the ecosystems, which produce negative consequences also on human wellbeing. Within this context, it has been much discussed how cities and the built environment can counteract this process by supporting more sustainable development. Adaptive reuse is defined as "a process that changes a disused or ineffective item into a new item that can be used for a different purpose", which strongly triggers the sustainable development of cities. It can be recognized as a promoter of economic growth, social wellbeing, and environmental preservation, given its capability of both preserving past values and creating new ones. The adaptive reuse matches the main points of the circular economy, seen as the sustainable economy, which is aimed at the reduction of natural resource extraction and environmental impact by extending the useful life of materials and promoting recovery, reuse, and regeneration processes. Given these premises, the current contribution aimed to evaluate alternative scenarios for reuse in Castello Visconteo in Cusago, located in the Lombardy region (Italy), and understanding how adaptive reuse could contribute to generating new values within a circular economy perspective. In detail, four alternative scenarios were proposed to face the new needs born during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Since both intangible and tangible values must be considered, a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) has been applied by combining economic and qualitative indicators to define the most suitable function for its adaptive reuse. In detail, the Novel Approach to Imprecise Assessment and Decision Environments (NAIADE) was used to identify the best alternative solution based on the opinions of conflicting stakeholders. The innovativeness of the contribution is given by the combination of different methodologies, the preservation of the memory and the generation of new values, and the consideration of adaptive reuse as a strategy for the achievement of sustainable development within a circular economy perspective.

AB  - The significance of environmental deterioration as a pressing issue has led to its prominence in global discussions on strategies for prevention. It can be asserted that there exists a universal agreement that the enhancement of environmental quality is imperative for the promotion of sustainable development and societal well-being, especially in emerging economies. In this perspective, the present research uses panel data of the E7 economies from 1992 to 2021 to assess the effects of income disparity, urbanization, resources consumption (nonrenewable and renewable energy consumption), and women employers on ecological footprint. This study employs second-generation empirical techniques such as CIPS and CADF unit root tests, Westerlund bootstrap cointegration, and DFE/MG/PMG-ARDL models to check the relationships between the studied variables. The empirical findings of this study reveal that in the E7 countries, the ecological footprint is increased with an increased income disparity and nonrenewable energy consumption. On the other hand, urbanization, renewable energy consumption, and female employers help reduce the ecological footprint. Additionally, the results of the causality measure under the Dumitrescu and Hurlin test unveil bidirectional causality between all the independent variables except nonrenewable energy and ecological footprint. From the policy perspective, the selected countries must implement policies that promote equitable income distribution, planned urbanization to promote compact cities, efficient transportation systems, and green infrastructure, and provide opportunities for women to attain higher positions in organizations, particularly at the managerial and decision-making levels in order to address the adverse environmental consequences in emerging economies.

AB  - To address the inter-connected climate and biodiversity crises, it is crucial to understand how multifunctional urban green infrastructure (UGI) is perceived to contribute to carbon neutrality, biodiversity, human well-being, and justice outcomes in cities. We explore how urban residents, including youth, associate carbon-related meanings with multifunctional UGI and how these meanings relate to co-benefits to biodiversity, well-being, and broader sustainability outcomes. Our findings are based on a survey distributed among urban residents of Helsinki, Finland (n = 487) and reveal how carbon-related meanings of UGI manifest at different levels of abstraction, agency, and scale, and incorporate community values and concerns attributed to the planning, features, functions, and transformational dimensions of UGI. Core carbon-related meanings of UGI emphasize either actions towards sustainability, carbon neutrality, biodiversity, or unfamiliarity towards such meanings. Perceived justice concerns and the socio-demographic contexts of the respondents covaried with carbon-related meanings associated with UGI. The results illustrate community perceptions of how it is not only possible, but rather expected, that multifunctional UGI is harnessed to tackle climate change, human well-being, and biodiversity loss in cities. Challenges for implementing the carbon-related benefits of UGI include navigating the different expectations placed on UGI and including residents with diverse socio-economic backgrounds during the process. Our findings contribute to a holistic understanding of how multifunctional UGI can help bridge policy agendas related to carbon neutrality, biodiversity protection, and human well-being that cities can implement when aiming for sustainable, just, and socially acceptable transitions towards a good Anthropocene.

AB  - Over the past decade, China has undergone an ambitious coal power phaseout that has induced a set of socio-economic rearrangements. To provide new insights into the socio-economic effects of this phaseout in addressing global climate change, we conducted an empirical analysis at both the macro and micro levels in China from 2014 to 2020. We found that the negative impacts of this phaseout led to 3.1% and 1.9% decreases in annual income for rural and urban populations, respectively. Despite facing macro-economic challenges, individuals report overall increased levels of happiness and life satisfaction. Collectively, these findings reveal a phenomenon in which macro socio-economic performance and subjective well-being (SWB) are driven in different directions during the phaseout. Our study uncovers potential socio-economic injustices as well as opportunities in the context of the coal power phaseout, highlighting the importance of flexibility in designing decarbonization strategies.The rapid coal power phaseout is expected to lead to uncertain socio-economic consequences. This study in China reveals that the impacts on macro-level performance and subjective well-being are driven in opposite directions during the phaseout.

AB  - Ensuring urban ecological welfare performance through low-carbon city pilot policy is essential for building sustainable and livable cities with human well-being as the priority. However, current research often emphasizes carbon emission reduction while overlooking a comprehensive evaluation of ecological welfare performance. This study examines the impact of low-carbon city pilot policy on ecological welfare in 282 Chinese cities from 2001 to 2021, employing a double fixed-effects model and propensity score matching difference-in-differences approach. The results show that (1) the low-carbon city pilot policy significantly enhances urban ecological welfare performance on the whole. (2) The policy positively affects environmental performance in nonresource-based and non-old industrial cities, while showing no significant impact in resourcebased and old industrial cities due to their economic dependencies and structural challenges. And (3) optimizing industrial structure is vital for advancing low-carbon city pilots policy as it supports technological innovation in companies. This paper recommends interventions focused on industrial structure optimization and technological innovation to enhance urban low-carbon development and ecological welfare.

AB  - The spatial configuration of urban areas impacts environmental sustainability, social equity, and economic and social resilience. This study examines the intricate relationship between spatial arrangements and the planning and design of BREEAM Outstanding projects in London, UK. It analyses the relationship between urban morphology and the effectiveness of sustainable building practices and contributes to the broader objectives of urban sustainability. This research focuses on London, UK-a city renowned for its complex urban fabric and architectural heterogeneity-using a multi-case study approach to dissect the elements that facilitate the development of BREEAM Outstanding projects. This study analyses key spatial characteristics such as land use diversity, subway network analysis, and street network analysis using betweenness centrality of edges and node degrees. These factors are considered due to their impact on energy performance, carbon emissions, and social sustainability metrics. Furthermore, this research explores how urban design strategies, such as enhanced walkability and mixed-use development, reinforce the success of BREEAM-certified Outstanding-rated projects. The findings of this investigation reveal a correlation between urban environments and the development of BREEAM Outstanding-rated projects in London. By aligning the spatial organisation of urban form with BREEAM principles, urban planners, policymakers, and architects can facilitate the creation of cities that are environmentally sustainable, socially inclusive, and economically prosperous. The research offers substantive insights and actionable recommendations for future urban development, advocating for a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach to sustainable city planning and design. The spatial arrangement of urban form impacts the planning and design of BREEAM Outstanding projects. Findings from current and future research will be used to investigate the connections between spatial arrangement and various categories in BREEAM and how they can influence future sustainable urban environments to set a benchmark for sustainability for contributing to a more equitable urban future.

AB  - Urban planning and design in the 21st century is increasingly focusing on sustainability, illustrated by the proliferation of greener cities. While operational definitions and the actual planning of these cities can vary considerably (e.g., eco cities and low carbon cities), conceptually, at least, these terms overlap, particularly with regard to how they attempt to achieve both greener infrastructural design and healthier human lifestyles. This paper presents the findings of survey-based research carried out within Lingang New Town in Shanghai in 2019. In the cities of the Global North, the interplay between green infrastructural provision and public health has been of interest, especially in the context of social inequalities; however, there is little research from rapidly urbanizing countries where green urbanism is being increasingly promoted. Using this newly constructed example, we identified a clear positive correlation between moving to a green city and the adoption of healthier lifestyles. The structural equation modelling results suggest that behaviors around the use of green space as well as perceptions of different green space have notable impacts on residents' physical health, measured by body mass index (BMI). The findings further illustrate systemic inequalities among private housing, rental housing and public housing typologies with regard to the distribution of health benefits.

AB  - Understanding the relationships between ultrafine particle (UFP) exposure, socioeconomic status (SES), and sustainable transportation accessibility in Toronto, Canada is crucial for promoting public health, addressing environmental justice, and ensuring transportation equity. We conducted a large-scale mobile measurement campaign and employed a gradient boost model to generate exposure surfaces using land use, built environment, and meteorological conditions. The Ontario Marginalization Index was used to quantify various indicators of social disadvantage for Toronto's neighborhoods. Our findings reveal that people in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas experience elevated UFP exposures. We highlight significant disparities in accessing sustainable transportation, particularly in areas with higher ethnic concentrations. When factoring in daily mobility, UFP exposure disparities in disadvantaged populations are further exacerbated. Furthermore, individuals who do not generate emissions themselves are consistently exposed to higher UFPs, with active transportation users experiencing the highest UFP exposures both at home and at activity locations. Finally, we proposed a novel index, the Community Prioritization Index (CPI), incorporating three indicators, including air quality, social disadvantage, and sustainable transportation. This index identifies neighborhoods experiencing a triple burden, often situated near major infrastructure hubs with high diesel truck activity and lacking greenspace, marking them as high -priority areas for policy action and targeted interventions.

AB  - The growth of cities creates challenges to biodiversity and social justice. Researchers addressing these challenges often do so in silos; their efforts persistently separate justice for non-humans and humans. We analyze this separation through two concepts—luxury effect and green gentrification—that each explores urban greenspace and justice, but from different angles. The luxury effect implicitly targets justice for non-humans by exploring biodiversity in cities and finds that wealth explains the distribution of biodiversity. Green gentrification explicitly targets justice for humans by examining how new greenspaces affect people and finds that such greenspaces often displace vulnerable people. Using scientometric analyses, we show the disjunction between these concepts. We draw on socio-ecological justice concepts to suggest that disregarding relationships and conflicts among humans and non-humans in concepts does not eliminate them in practice, but stalls progress toward just cities. We urge scholars to simultaneously focus on justice for humans and non-humans.

AB  - Urbanization is a multifaceted process characterized by changes in urban areas through various means, such as sprawl, ribbon development, or infill and compact growth. This phenomenon changes the pattern of the local climate zone (LCZ) and significantly affects the climate, vegetation dynamics, energy consumption, water resources, and public health. This study aims to discern the impacts of changes in urban growth on the LCZ and land surface temperature (LST) over a two-decade period. A comprehensive methodology that integrates statistical analysis, data visualization, machine learning, and advanced techniques, such as remote sensing technology and geospatial analysis systems, is employed. ENVI, GEE, and GIS tools are utilized to collect, process, and monitor satellite data and imagery of temporal and spatial variations in intensive or diffuse urbanization processes from 2003 to 2023 to analyze and simulate land use and land cover (LULC) changes, urbanization index (UI), LCZ patterns, and LST changes over the years and to make overlapping maps of changes to recognize the relation between LULC, LCZ, and LST. This study focuses on Seville’s urban area, which has experienced rapid urbanization and a significant increase in average temperature during the last few decades. The findings of this study will provide actionable recommendations into the interplay between urban growth and climate and highlight the pivotal role of urban growth in shaping resilience and vulnerable areas based on microclimate changes. Urban planners can leverage these insights to predict alternatives for the future development of urban areas and define practical climate mitigation strategies.

AB  - Ithaca, a city of 30,000 people in the Southern Tier of New York state, has pledged to be carbon-neutral by 2030. The city government is leading the way by implementing a strategy to achieve full decarbonization, including all areas of the economy. That means vehicles, buildings, the electric grid, waste, and land use."It's a huge challenge," admits Luis Aguirre-Torres, the director of sustainability for Ithaca. "That's 6,000 buildings in the next seven years, and 10,000 vehicles. We need to improve infrastructure. But we also have to make sure that climate justice is at core of our policy."Ithaca is only one example of the cities in the United States that are out in front of federal policy on climate change. "Cities have been taking the lead and been a huge part of the progress, especially during the Trump administration," points out Julia Peek, director of communication and mobilization at the Urban Sustainability Directors Network. "Cities are doing incredible work to become energy efficient, reduce pollution, increase resilience, and connect with affected communities."Cities and localities have taken the lead because, frankly, the federal government has failed to develop a consistent approach to a clean energy transition. The Obama administration pushed hard to support the Paris climate deal in 2015, only for the Trump administration to pull out of the agreement as soon as it took office. The Biden administration began with its own vision of "building back better" then encountered fierce resistance to its decarbonization plans not only from the Republican Party in Congress but a couple members of its own party as well.

AB  - Urban mobility and sustainable transportation are fundamental for the European Union's goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2050. The EU encourages national governments to prioritize zero-emission urban transport systems that emphasize safety, accessibility, and inclusiveness. Promoting walking plays a fundamental role in sustainable urban mobility, offering advantages such as emission reduction, better air quality, and enhanced public health. Recent research underscores the importance of creating appealing and safe pedestrian environments to encourage walking. These efforts align with the United Nations' Agenda 2030 sustainability goals, particularly Objective 11, which aims to build inclusive, safe, and sustainable cities and communities. This paper explores the factors influencing pedestrians' willingness to walk and categorizes them into basic factors, performance factors, and excitement factors, on the basis of the three factors theory. Significantly, the study reveals that the importance of these factors varies based on demographics, mainly the age of the users. Understanding these factors and their relative significance for pedestrian satisfaction is crucial for shaping effective policies and urban planning strategies aimed at promoting sustainable mobility. By prioritizing pedestrian satisfaction and addressing the specific needs and preferences of diverse groups, cities can create more walkable and environmentally friendly urban environments. These findings offer valuable insights for policymakers and urban planners working toward EU climate-neutral objectives and enhancing the well-being of citizens.

AB  - The planetary boundaries (PBs) are a widely used framework defining a “safe operating space” for environmental sustainability at the global level. However, they do not straightforwardly translate into indicators applicable in a building project. This paper proposes a procedure to set and assess absolute sustainability targets related to the PBs in a building project, exemplified in the case of Denmark. The first step is to ensure that the targets and the assessment method use comparable indicators. Common building life cycle assessment (LCA) tools use impact categories that do not directly match the PBs. Two options are considered to address this issue. Dedicated characterization factors can be used to convey LCA results in indicators consistent with the PBs. Alternatively, PB targets can be converted into LCA impact categories. Then, several distributive justice principles are reviewed to allocate a share of planetary sustainability targets to an individual country, to the housing sector within that country, and to an individual project. We argue that principles that conserve existing unsustainable paradigms are not appropriate to set planetary sustainability targets, and propose a novel approach for sectorial allocation based on sufficientarianism and “decent living” scenarios. Finally, challenges related to the assessment of these targets are highlighted. In particular, the paper draws attention to differences in system boundaries between the LCA and the targets.

AB  - The emerging notion of emissions inequality expands the idea of sustainability by incorporating economic opportunity as well as social needs and rights into environmental costs and benefits. In China, increasing inequality among urban households in terms of both income and housing wealth establishes a pattern of social stratification. An understanding of the association of social and environmental inequality is thus critical for urban sustainability. Based on the Chinese urban household survey from 2002 to 2009, this article employs the lifestyle approach to calculate and analyse the inequality of households by direct and indirect carbon emissions. The correlations among carbon emission inequality with income and housing wealth inequality are estimated with a Heckman procedure. We find that not only income distribution but also housing wealth distributionis an important consideration in understanding environmental inequality in China.

AB  - Environmental justice - the concept that environmental amenities and burdens should be shared equitably among all races and socioeconomic classes - has gained diplomatic traction internationally, and political traction domestically in the United States, in recent years. In this paper, we focus on developing federal policy relevant to transportation project planning and operation in the U.S.; however, these developments reflect international issues of inequity associated with climate change and environmental burdens. First, we provide an overview of federal policy initiatives related to environmental justice, including President Biden's Justice40 initiative. Then, we examine the U.S. National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) as a potential avenue for mandating environmental justice assessment in the transportation industry, through the lenses of both procedural and distributive justice. Finally, we review several publicly available online Geographical Information System (GIS) tools that were recently developed for purposes of expanding public and governmental understanding of environmental justice challenges, and provide decision support for users to incorporate these tools into the environmental impact assessment process for transportation projects.

AB  - The energy budget of households, linked to residential energy consumption (REC), serves as a critical indicator of quality of life and economy trends. Despite the lack of widely available accurate statistics at regional or smaller scales, they are of crucial interest for a better understanding of the features influencing REC and its impact on energy poverty, wellbeing, and the climate crisis. This research aims to present a new information model for predictive parameters and REC forecasting through an innovative use of available open data. Geoprocessing, data mining, and machine learning clustering algorithms were applied to open datasets of location, population, and residential building stock parameters highly correlated with their REC, on the ensemble of 785 municipalities of Andalusia, Spain. The model identified 65 clusters of towns sharing the same potential REC, with 73% of the population concentrated in 10 of these. The resulting data-driven bottom-up model of provincial REC had a mean absolute error of only 0.63%. Furthermore, it provided the territorial distribution, with local resolution, of the identified clusters of cities with similar characteristics. This methodology, with a flexible regional- to city-scale analysis, provides knowledge generation that offers numerous practical applications for energy policy planning. Its future implementation would assist stakeholders and policymakers in enhancing the performance and decarbonization of the residential building stock.

AB  - Urban agriculture is increasingly recognized as a strategy for enhancing sustainability and well-being in urban areas, mainly through circular economy principles. This study investigates residents’ perspectives from three major cities in western Romania—Arad, Timișoara, and Oradea—on the implementation and benefits of urban agriculture. The main goal was to identify differences in opinions regarding urban agriculture’s potential to improve biodiversity conservation, enhance carbon dioxide retention, and reduce synthetic compound usage. The research also explored community development through circular economy practices and tools local authorities could use to promote urban agriculture. A survey of 573 respondents utilized variance analysis and the Tukey test to reveal significant opinion differences among residents. The findings showed notable variations in views on biodiversity conservation and community development benefits but no significant differences in opinions on carbon dioxide capture or synthetic chemical use. Residents of Timișoara and Oradea expressed more favorable views on urban agriculture than those in Arad. Participants emphasized the importance of free land allocation and sustainable practices for successful urban agriculture implementation. This study offers valuable insights for policymakers and contributes to the understanding of urban sustainability and the role of urban agriculture in supporting circular economy principles.

AB  - Rapid urban expansion across the globe has created enormous problems on human wellbeing and the environment. In this regard, urban green infrastructure has played a major role in improving the quality of life and is perceived as one of the vital instruments for attaining sustainable development goals. Yet, the issue of access to green spaces is one of the crucial aspects of sustainable urban development and has got considerable attention in the global north, although relatively little is known in the global south. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the accessibility of green spaces and the factors that enhance or inhibit their accessibility in urban centers of Ethiopia in reference to the emerging towns of Oromia's special zone surrounding Finfinne. This study used network analysis, backed by interviews and observation. Results show that the average green space per capita in the towns of Sululta, Sebeta, and Legetafo is 2.66 m2, 0.9 m2, and 2.17 m2, respectively. Findings also showed that 84.7%, 64.6%, and 60.4% of the inhabitants of Sululta, Sebeta, and Legetafo, respectively, have no access to green spaces from their residences within a walking distance of 300–1000 m. The key factors that hinder its accessibility are rapid urban expansion and population growth, violation of the plan, and institutional failure. The study suggests enhancing the percentage, coverage and per capita of green spaces, controlling land-use violations, and prioritizing it as one of the key government agendas in order to achieve the eleventh goal of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.

AB  - Urban agriculture (UA) has been explored as a nature‐based solution to address metropolises' socioecological challenges. The current study strives to determine which dimensions and components of socioecological resilience are most affected by UA in urban ecosystems. Q‐methodology was applied to identify shared discourses between experts in UA and to provide insights into how experts perceive resilience in socioecological ecosystems. The data were gathered by completing the Q table (41 statements) and interviewing experts (29 participants) in agriculture, urban planning, environmental science, urban landscape, and urban practice. The results revealed seven distinct perspectives possessed by experts with eigenvalues of 11.23, 2.37, 1.94, 1.48, 1.39, 1.25, and 1.11 and explanatory variances of 0.387, 0.08, 0.067, 0.05, 0.04, 0.04, and 0.03, respectively. The perspectives included (1) promoting a happy and healthy life, (2) integrating land use, waste, and energy management, (3) ensuring food security and protection of production resources, (4) promoting social interaction and relaxation, (5) improving biodiversity and picture quality, (6) motivating creativity for community health, and (7) reducing the ecological footprint and cost and food insecurity. Each perspective entails a different understanding of the role of UA on socioecological resilience in metropolitan areas. The results contribute to the ongoing theoretical discussion regarding the nature of the current UA in metropolises, its development, and potential conventionalization. Overall, these findings suggest a role for UA in promoting resilience in metropolises to make them socially and ecologically better places for life.

AB  - Urbanization has caused multiple environmental grand challenges that impair urban sustainability. Urban vegetation (UV), a mainstream nature-based solution (NBS), can mitigate urban challenges through providing important ecosystem services (ESs). However, successful implementation of UV to provide ESs, is impaired due to insufficient knowledge of its effectiveness under different climatic and socio-economic conditions. Here, we quantify seven ESs provided by UV across 2,148 cities with R250,000 residents. We show that UV makes substantial contributions to outdoor recreation and stormwater regulation but is less effective in reducing air pollution, in most cities, regardless of the climatic and socio-economic context. The contributions of UV to carbon sequestration, coastal protection, shade provision, and land surface temperature reduction were generally smaller and varied substantially dependent on city climatic and human development index characteristics. Comprehensive assessments for urban NBS planning are essential to maximize ES efficacy for urban sustainability improvements and support human well-being.

AB  - Growth management is the branch of urban planning concerned with the timing and sequencing of land development and the policies designed to mitigate the more negative impacts of growth. These policies are often justified on the ground that rapid or poorly planned development causes “quality of place” to deteriorate, reducing both current welfare and the prospects for future growth (i.e., “killing the goose that laid the golden egg”). In this article, I evaluate the normative assumptions underlying this popular argument. I conclude that the “golden egg” argument makes an implicit analogy to resource economics and raises legitimate issues of sustainability and dynamic efficiency. Although an understanding of resource economics can provide more normative guidance than one typically finds in the urban planning literature, using these concepts to make policy is no easy task. Thus the golden egg argument remains subject to cynical manipulation by both pro‐ and antigrowth forces. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The paper discusses research results on waste governance and circular economy, conducted with waste picker cooperatives in the metropolitan region of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Two cases have been selected, from a pool of 21 waste picker organizations, to video document their grassroots eco-social innovations that have improved local waste management and the lives of the cooperative members. The videos support knowledge sharing with key actors in waste governance and the circular economy. Social grassroots innovation theory focuses on livelihood opportunities beyond the formal labour market, pursuing social inclusion by creating meaningful work for in-dividuals who were considered left out and in vulnerable situations. Transitioning to sustainability necessarily goes beyond socio-technical innovations but rather inte-grates eco-social perspectives. After first introducing grassroots innovation theory and the concept of eco-social innovations the paper describes the empirical frame and presents two cases where organized waste pickers were successful in opera-tionalizing innovations that address the circular economy and contribute to sustain -ability transitions. Key findings highlighted are cooperative governance, long-term partnership building, improved productivity and increased income.

AB  - The growth of cities creates challenges to biodiversity and social justice. Researchers addressing these challenges often do so in silos; their efforts persistently separate justice for non-humans and humans. We analyze this separation through two concepts-luxury effect and green gentrification-that each explores urban greenspace and justice, but from different angles. The luxury effect implicitly targets justice for non-humans by exploring biodiversity in cities and finds that wealth explains the distribution of biodiversity. Green gentrification explicitly targets justice for humans by examining how new greenspaces affect people and finds that such greenspaces often displace vulnerable people. Using scientometric analyses, we show the disjunction between these concepts. We draw on socio-ecological justice concepts to suggest that disregarding relationships and conflicts among humans and non-humans in concepts does not eliminate them in practice, but stalls progress toward just cities. We urge scholars to simultaneously focus on justice for humans and non-humans.

AB  - Shrinking cities are places characterized by long-term population decline, property abandonment, social inequality, and environmental degradation. Urban scholarship, however, has not yet addressed the challenges of promoting social and environmental justice in shrinking cities. Focusing on Kitakyushu City, Japan, this article explores the manner in which grassroots movements can push forward environmental justice and how that can lead to policies coping with urban shrinkage and environmental degradation. Kitakyushu City was Japan's major iron and steel center during the rapid industrialization years, which culminated in severe environmental degradation. The need for environmental justice pushed grassroots movements and, in particular, women's associations to initiate different campaigns aimed at raising awareness of the city's environmental hazards and to trigger governmental response. Since then, environmental policies are driving Kitakyushu City's fight against the negative consequences that shrinkage brings about in Japanese cities. Using case study methodology and critically assessing the implemented policies, this article argues that seeking environmental justice presents an opportunity to tackle long-term decline. Hence, the article explores the theoretical implications and empirical factors behind environmental justice as the basis for a new urban revitalization model.

AB  - This paper is a broad review of green infrastructure theory and practice relative to urban sustainability and the space for geographers in these discussions. We use examples from various urban sustainability plans to highlight ways in which green infrastructure is being conceptualized and implemented. We explore how geography contributes research on green infrastructure as well as the emerging practices as seen within sustainability plans. We identify four areas in which geographers can influence both green infrastructure theory and practice: 1) scale; 2) mapping distribution; 3) sensitivity to place and locale; and 4) equity and access. We conclude that in these areas geographers have tremendous opportunity contribute more deliberately to sustainable urbanism.

AB  - The practice of stormwater management has evolved from a singular focus on drainage to a multifaceted approach to support the integrated urban development of healthy, livable, ecological, and water sensitive cities from neighborhood to metropolitan scales. A review of the knowledge base and practice by the professional stormwater management community shows attributes that favor an integrative approach to achieve co-benefits across sectors. Research into stormwater management addresses its functional areas of drainage, flood control, flood plain management, water quality control, urban ecology, recreation, and city beautification. Legacy path dependance affects the potential to reform land use practices, while stormwater management practice is affected by climate change, sea level rise, urbanization, inequality, and poor governance. This review shows a status where technical methods are well advanced but integrative frameworks to address social, ecological and infrastructure needs are more challenging. The sensitivity of ecological issues is most evident in cities in coastal zones. Organizational initiatives are needed to counter the neglect of essential maintenance and sustain flood risk reduction in cities. Stormwater management is related to other integrative tools, including IWRM, One Water, One Health, and Integrated Flood Management, as well as the broader concept of urban planning. This research review demonstrates the opportunities and needs for the advancement of an integrated approach to stormwater management to support urban development. Stormwater capture and rainfall harvesting offer major opportunities to augment scarce water supplies. Nature-based solutions like low-impact development and the sponge city concept show promise to transform cities. Major cities face challenges to sustain conveyance corridors for major flows and to store and treat combined sewer runoff. The neighborhood focus of stormwater management elevates the importance of participation and inclusion to advance environmental justice and strengthen social capital. Integrating organizational initiatives from local to city scales and funding improvements to stormwater systems are major challenges that require leadership from higher governance levels, although governments face resistance to change toward integration, especially in countries with poor land use and public works management systems. Finding solutions to neighborhood issues and the connectivity of water systems at larger scales requires complex approaches to urban planning and represent an important agenda for urban and water governance going forward.

AB  - Urban sustainability is most often measured using a series of social, economic, and ecological indicators. Assessment methods for urban sustainability typically factor in the ecological dimensions of greenspace, such as biodiversity maintenance, stormwater management, and/or air quality-yet indicator schemas that consider only the ecological dimensions largely overlook the social benefits of some types of urban greenspace, particularly community gardens and orchards. This article makes the case that the process of community formation and strengthening that occurs in shared growing spaces is an important element of urban sustainability in its own right. Based on 55 interviews of community garden advocates, policy-makers, and development professionals involved in urban agriculture planning, this article traces the widespread understanding among practitioners that shared growing spaces strengthen social as well as environmental sustainability, though the social benefits are often difficult to measure. The latter concern was most frequently expressed by urban agriculture advocates who, after involvement in the political process, perceived the need for such metrics in order to communicate persuasively with planners and policy makers. The social values of shared growing spaces, at once self-evident to garden advocates and difficult for them to demonstrate with quantitative data, may be theorized by drawing on insights from sociology: A truly sustainable city requires community coalescence among diverse citizens, and such community is fostered particularly well in shared growing spaces.

AB  - In response to anthropogenic climate change, many governments are adopting policies to reduce carbon emissions. In Canada, federal and provincial governments have implemented carbon pricing. One of the effects of putting a price on carbon is increasing the cost of using private vehicles, which may reduce mobility and increase the risk of social exclusion, especially in contexts where car dependence is high. In this article, we analyse how municipal governments in Canada frame the challenges of climate change and reducing emissions, and examine whether they link these challenges to issues of mobility and social exclusion. Focusing on policies from four of Canada's largest cities - Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg and Vancouver - we identify four main frames used in planning documents: "the Growing City", "If You Build It, They Will Come", "Better City for All", and "the Resilient City". The Growing City frame is used to support status quo urban development, with climate mitigation options (including sustainable travel modes) optionally included for more concerned residents. This is the dominant frame in Calgary, Edmonton, and Winnipeg. Conversely, Vancouver uses the Resilient City frame to indicate that climate mitigation and adaption strategies are essential, and all citizens must be prepared for change. Vancouver presents changes to mobility as necessary for all, rather than an option for some. Social exclusion is not explicitly addressed in the frames, though it is presented as a reason to support building alternative transportation or more public spaces. Social exclusion receives little consideration as a potential consequence of climate mitigation policies.

AB  - Low-carbon (LC) cities are the cities that people long for today. LC environmental protection plays a very important role in people's health. The construction of a city in LC is a great cause that contributes to the present and benefits the future. In this study, we propose a development and sustainability evaluation system for building low-carbon cities based on the Internet of Things (IoT). The study is novel in that it considers key areas such as urban planning, environmental issues and solutions, and how the Internet of Things can optimize low-carbon logistics and smart grids, with the aim of promoting the formation of low-carbon city models. This comprehensive approach not only presents problems and solutions in low-carbon urban planning but also focuses on how the Internet of Things can be used as a key technology to promote low-carbon urban development. The urban development of LC was constructed with a sustainable evaluation system, so that people could experience the life of LC. Through the investigation of the degree of atmospheric pollution of LC cities using the Internet of Things, this article found that the highest degree of atmospheric pollution was 30. The highest degree of atmospheric pollution in cities in LC without IoT was 53. The severity of water pollution in cities in LC using IoT technology ranged from 10 to 25, while those without IoT ranged from 30 to 60. The degree of soil pollution in LC cities using IoT technology was concentrated in 10-30, while those without using IoT were concentrated in 30-50. Through these experimental data, it could be seen that IoT technology could reduce environmental pollution, thus achieving the effect of LC cities. This shows that the use of IoT technology in LC cities was highly feasible.Low-carbon (LC) cities are the cities that people long for today.

AB  - This study investigates the socio-economic impact of smart housing, emphasizing energy consumption efficiency within Smart City initiatives. Through a comprehensive analysis incorporating data collection, computational modelling in the Wolfram Language, and comparative studies, the research highlights how smart housing – equipped with IoT devices, artificial intelligence, and energy management systems – significantly enhances energy efficiency compared to traditional housing. The findings reveal that smart housing not only reduces energy consumption and carbon emissions but also promotes economic savings and improves quality of life. Despite challenges such as technological adoption barriers and the digital divide, effective management strategies and policy support are identified as key enablers. This research contributes valuable insights into the role of smart housing in advancing sustainable urban development, demonstrating its potential to reshape urban living for a more sustainable and inclusive future.

AB  - During the past several decades, much progress has been made in the understanding of how urban green space promotes the mental well-being of urban residents. In particular, the last two decades have witnessed a growing interest in the association between the quantity of urban green space and the effect on residents’ well-being. However, little research has attempted to disentangle the linkage between the structure of urban green space and mental well-being beyond the quantity aspect. To address this question, this dissertation includes a literature review regarding restorative mechanisms influenced by the spatial characteristics of urban green space. Also, this dissertation includes experimental and observational studies: a biodiversity study and a landscape pattern study.In the biodiversity study, I examined how the biodiversity of campus green space can promote mental well-being of college students by assessing their visual and auditory perceptions of two green spaces having either low or high biodiversity. I employed a 2 by 2 study design, in which 319 students were randomly assigned to one of four treatments: (1) low biodiversity without sound, (2) high biodiversity without sound, (3) low biodiversity with sound, and (4) high biodiversity with sound. In a controlled setting, students viewed on a computer a 360-degree-view video of either a low- or high-diversity site, with or without the natural sounds at each site, that had been recorded on the Kansas State University campus (a grassy lawn area, and a native meadow garden). The restorative status and mood of students were evaluated both pre-intervention and post-intervention via a self-reported survey. The results of this study revealed that neither biodiversity level nor sound by themselves had any significant effect on the mood or restorative status of these college students. However, a significant interaction effect between the visual and auditory perceptions was found. Students who were exposed to a high-biodiversity environment with natural sound conditions were shown to have lower levels of negative mood states compared to those without natural sound conditions.In the landscape-pattern study, I explored how landscape patterns (i.e., composition and configuration) are associated with the mental health of residents in the city of Chicago. This study used mental health and socioeconomic data from a total of 6,405 residents from 61 Chicago communities in the Healthy Chicago Survey conducted by the Chicago Department of Public Health. High-Resolution Land Cover (HRLC) data were used to calculate urban green space (e.g., trees, grass, and water). Landscape metrics were quantified to measure landscape patterns, including percentage, size, distance, and aggregation of urban green space in 61 community areas across Chicago. The results of this study showed that residents who resided in urban landscapes with small water bodies and that had greater distances between forested areas (owing to the presence of several large urban parks and forests within the Chicago study area) reported less psychological distress. As for total urban green space, there was a lower level of psychological distress in landscapes with a disaggregated distribution of urban green spaces (i.e., multiple small green spaces) in comparison with a single (or a few) large green space(s).These two studies have implications for landscape design and planning to improve the mental well-being of urban residents. Using both experimental and observational studies, this dissertation is able to contribute to a better understanding of mental restoration mechanisms provided by green spaces within urban environments on both a micro (site-based) and macro (landscape) scale. Furthermore, the study can provide insights into how landscape patterns and biodiversity affect human well-being in order to find a balance between human use and the conservation of nature.

AB  - Green regeneration has become one of the most powerful strategies for improving the quality of life in cities, supporting climate change adaptation, and reducing the carbon footprints of cities. While it is the ambition of most green regeneration projects to create benefits for residents and users, reality shows that green regeneration also reinforces existing or even shapes new ‘green inequalities’. These can result from green gentrification and displacement, procedural injustices, and exclusion from participation or barriers to the access and use of newly created urban green spaces. Set against this background, the paper uses a conflict analysis perspective to look at the inequalities and injustices that evolve within the context of green regeneration. Applying social conflict theory, it seeks to understand (1) why and how green regeneration may lead to inequality and justice conflicts and (2) how conflict analysis helps to understand the nature and implications of green regeneration conflicts in more depth. As for its empirical foundation, the paper reanalyses empirical evidence that was examined in earlier projects on a residential area in the city of Leipzig, Germany.

AB  - Extensive construction augmenting the infrastructure and real estate projects underpin Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 of sustainable cities. A part of this struggle involves the transformation of the existing infrastructure together with new construction, which generates a large amount of construction and demolition waste (CDW). In the absence of a structured life cycle assessment (LCA) framework, the waste management companies are planning future scenarios (phased expansions of material recovery facilities to improve the recycling rate) primarily on economic grounds. This study assesses the environmental impacts of the existing and planned CDW management practices of the Saudi Investment Recycling Company in Riyadh City by dint of LCA. Impact 2002+ performs life cycle impact assessment of the base case (45% recycling), four treatments (61, 76, 88, and 100% recycling), and zero waste scenarios. The study demonstrates the benefits of current CDW (mixed soil, concrete blocks, clay bricks, glazed tiles, and asphalt) recycling in terms of avoided impacts of non-renewable energy, global warming, carcinogens, non-carcinogens, and respiratory inorganics potentially generated by landfilling. For the treatment scenario of 100% recycling, CDW conversion into a wide range of aggregates (0–50 mm) can replace 10–100% virgin aggregates in backfilling, precast concrete manufacturing, encasements and beddings of water mains and sewers, manholes construction, non-load bearing walls, and farm-to-market roads. To achieve long-term economic and environmental sustainability, municipalities need to improve source segregation, handling, and storage practices to enhance the existing (45%) recycling rate to 100% in the next five years and approach the zero-waste scenario by 2030. The findings of the present study motivate the generators for source reduction as well as encourage the recycling companies and concerned organizations in the continuous performance improvement of the CDW management systems across Saudi Arabia on environmental grounds, as an addition to the perceived economic benefits.

AB  - Rapid urbanization results in farmland loss, habitat fragmentation, biodiversity decrease, and greenhouse gas emissions. Land-use policies and planning as administrative means are used to guide sustainable urban development and to balance the location of urban expansion and agricultural activities. To better understand the future implications of a variety of land-use policies, we used a FUTURES model scenario analysis to analyze the potential future patterns of urban areas and the loss and fragmentation of farmland and natural resources at the local level for Xi’an. We tested representative indicators of sustainable urbanization according to Plan 2014–2020. We found that scenarios representing the integration of several policies showed both synergetic spatial patterns and conflicting outcomes. The simulated land-use patterns of urban growth resulting from the combination of policies, were the most likely to support progress toward a livable compact city and natural resources’ conservation. These findings underscore the importance of simulation modeling and scenario analyses to quantify and visualize the results from policies and planning to support sustainable urbanization. Specifically, they show the value in simulation modeling for integrating information across scales, i.e., combining macro-level land-use policies with local-level spatial heterogeneity in socio-ecological settings, for identifying actionable planning solutions. Hence, these research results provide scientific support for land-use policy revision and implementation in Xi’an, as well as a reference point for other urbanizing cities in China.

AB  - Sydney is the largest city in Oceania (the Australia - south Pacific region). During its existence of more than 200 years the city has suffered many emergencies and many psycho-social and media crises - but has escaped major disaster in the sense of deaths or economic loss. Does this indicate that disaster vulnerability has been managed well, or simply that Sydney has been fortunate? The evidence suggests that the natural environment is relatively benign. With some important exceptions, such as flooding, management has rested largely on emergency response, and on handling the residual risk through increasingly sophisticated loss redistribution mechanisms. For the more obvious "natural" hazards this approach has worked so far. But the approach appears to be incapable of dealing with many of the more insidious slow-onset hazards such as environmental degradation and social inequality. Unfortunately these are among the constituent issues of sustainability. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Municipal solid waste management is one of the key challenges of environmental, economic and social importance. It is a global problem regardless of economic development level and political orientation, and also applies to a country such as Belarus. There is a lack of studies considering the local aspects of waste management in Belarus, therefore the research is actual. The study aims to formulate the recommendations on the conceptual modelling of the MSW management system in Belarus. The research methods are based on the complex systems approach. The study provides a review of the actual concepts on MSW management, including its general principles, hierarchy and methods, analysis of the current state of MSW management system in Belarus, and recommendations on modeling the MSW management system covering the local and regional aspects in Belarus. The suggestions on formulating the MSW management system involve organizational, economic, technical and informational bases as well as considering the local and regional specifics. The results indicate the following: (1) the current MSW management system in Belarus does not move the country towards a circular economy, requiring an update of the existing waste management strategy; (2) sustainable waste management demands an integrated approach in order to support waste recycling into a manufacturing resource within circular economy; (3) two main approaches to solve the problem of waste management in rural communities have been identified— an economic approach implies the minimization of waste generation while a technological approach comprises the development of mini-solutions for waste recycling at the places of waste generation. The research results contribute to the increased interest in the issue of MSW management in Belarus, and can be a useful tool for improving the planning strategies considering the local and regional context.

AB  - Urbanization disrupts landscapes and ecosystem functions, which poses threats to biodiversity, social systems, and human health, particularly among vulnerable populations. Urban land-use planners are faced with competing demands for housing, safety, transportation, and economic development and often lack tools to integrate these with protecting environmental functions. We identify three major barriers to integrating the benefits that flow with connected, functioning ecosystems into land-use planning. The lack of a shared language among planners and stakeholders poses a barrier to the restoration and preservation of ecological features. Methods of incorporating the benefits from connectivity are not standardized because values are not readily available or lack credibility. Ecological restoration tends to be poorly coordinated at broad scales, and thus often fails to achieve landscape-level objectives. To address these challenges, we developed a novel integrated framework, the Connectivity Benefits Framework (CBF), which combines the benefits from three categories of ecosystem connectivity with benefit- and risk-relevant indicators, enabling both monetary and non-monetary valuation of benefits. Moreover, it provides a method to identify and visualize the multiple and overlapping benefits from management actions to aid in prioritizing initiatives that support ecosystem functions. Unlike software tools that incorporate generalized values of ecosystem services at a landscape level, the CBF guides a systematic approach to community-engaged land-use planning that prioritizes localized societal needs while protecting biodiversity and ecosystem function for more equitable, resilient cities. We demonstrate the potential for multiple overlapping benefits from actions that restore and protect ecosystem connectivity by applying the framework to a transit planning project in Portland, Oregon.

AB  - The rapid growth of India’s urban population coupled with food security concerns has driven urban agriculture into Indian cities. It is also commonly known that urban local bodies are struggling with the ever-increasing municipal solid waste, and in managing its segregation, transportation, and treatment. Inadequate organic waste management causes a slew of issues like gas emissions and health risks to the community. Since household wet wastes are full of nutrient-rich organic matter favorable for growing plants, urban agriculture provides an excellent opportunity of bridging the gap by reimagining waste as a resource. This study is based on the premise that decentralized urban waste management can be achieved through reusing and recycling organic waste that can benefit urban food production. It has conducted a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the organic waste usage in urban agriculture in the Indian city of Mumbai, Maharashtra. This paper presents the results of the study and examines the existing and potential capacity of urban agriculture in consuming organic urban waste in Mumbai’s context. This case study also helps in visualizing circular economy against a real-life urban scenario and how the production-consumption loop may gainfully sustain each other. Based on the learning, the paper recommends mainstreaming urban agriculture into the sustainable city framework.

AB  - Biomass waste-to-energy (WtE) generation is a potential pathway for green urban transition in developing countries which can contribute significantly to sustainable development goal 7: affordable and clean energy. However, unlike fossil fuel energy systems, the economic returns from WtE systems are low because WtE generation is capital-intensive and requires subsidies. This study examines the prospects of a sustainable biomass electricity generation from rice husk (RH) using a large dataset of rice milling activities in a fast paced urban transition economy. The study analyzes the viability of several RH biomass electricity generation scenarios using indicators such as net electricity output, economic returns (benefits), and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). The results show that several mills/mill clusters generate sufficient daily RH that can power between 0.8 and 2.2 MW plant with a combined electricity output of about 500,000 MWh per annum. The economic analyses show that all RH biomass electricity generation scenarios return positive economic benefits under reduced social discount rates of 2-6%. Moreover, the LCOE of all scenarios are less than those of electricity generated from other sources. These results demonstrate that biomass waste-to-energy generation is viable for green urban development through low-carbon decentralized energy systems. Several policy implications of the findings are highlighted, including the need for policymakers and energy stakeholders to adopt sustainable biomass energy generation models such as "design, build, and operate" (DBO) to achieve sustainable WtE generation regimes that ensure green urban transition. Such a model will contribute to a circular economy and facilitates sustainable urban development that satisfies climate-related SDGs.

AB  - Since the 1980s, urban planning and development has increasingly taken account of natural water and nutrient cycles, with water flows managed as would have occurred on the original greenfield site, emulating the original ecosystem. However, other drivers deriving from the impact of urban development and increased human activity include managing stormwater quality, mitigating a risk of increased flooding, especially where there had been some previous history of them in the greenfield environment, harvesting of rainwater and stormwater for potable and nonpotable use, greening the urban environment to reduce the heat island effect generated by intensive urban development and increased pavements, and improving the aesthetics of the urban environment to encourage a feeling of well-being in the community. These philosophies were developed in North America as Low Impact Development and later Green Infrastructure (which sometimes also assumes a consideration of energy management) in response to the 1972 passage of the Clean Water Act (US). Planning may incorporate green roofs, rain gardens, swales, permeable pavements, wetlands, green spaces, and urban natural vegetation corridors. Britain adopted Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SuDS) techniques. In Europe, planners and local government respond to the European Union Water Management and Flooding Directives on a river basin basis. In Australia, similar policy developments took place under the philosophy of Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD). The components and drivers vary between communities, each choosing emphases appropriate to their catchments, infrastructure, seasonal climate, local water cycle, and social expectations. Cities in East Asia have been undergoing rapid urbanization over the past 40 years, often accompanied by increased flooding, especially in China. In 2013, China introduced new urban policies which included the concept of Sponge Cities where "stormwater can be naturally conserved, infiltrated, and purified" for potential reuse, thereby reducing flood risks and increasing water availability. Construction guidelines were issued. Thirty major cities are participating as pilot cities. Each is eligible for central government subsidies. In Africa, the term Water-Sensitive Settlements has been suggested as the WSUD approach as originally envisaged does not take cognizance of the "developmental" or "equity" issues, which are particularly important in developing countries that may have legacies from their colonial or apartheid past. Many countries are now beginning to consider the necessity for WSUD in their cities and settlements. Addressing technical integration problems, legislative constraints, social equity, and community acceptance will be necessary for them to develop Water Sensitive Cities. This chapter summarizes the history of WSUD adoption and examples of the approach that has been taken across the globe.

AB  - While scholars have widely discussed the relationship between urbanization, economic development and environmental degradation, little is known about how urbanization affects human well-being. This paper examines the effects of urbanization on the carbon intensity of human well-being (CIWB) in 125 countries in the period of 1990-2017. The CIWB is an indicator that reflects the nexus between environmental pressure and humans living standards. According to the principle of the CIWB, our results reveal that CIWB values declined over the study period, which represents an optimistic outcome in that it indicates that human well-being increased at a faster rate than increases in per capita CO2 emissions. By employing a two-way fixed effects of Prais-Winsten regression approach, we evaluated the influence of urbanization on the CIWB in countries with various urbanization levels. Our study further selected five international cooperative organizations, each characterized by their own urbanization levels, in order to further understand whether different urbanization levels exert different impacts on the CIWB. The empirical results showed the existence of obvious differences in these effects: urbanization is shown to have prominently reduced the CIWB in countries with low and medium levels of urbanization, while it may increase the CIWB in highly urbanized countries. The empirical results obtained in relation to the cooperative organizations approximately accord with the results obtained in relation to the countries when grouped by urbanization level. The study reinforces the importance of scientific urban planning, environmental and population policies for the sustainable development of countries at different stages of urbanization.

AB  - Industrial buildings play vital roles in a society, from shaping the economic, technological, cultural, and social fabric of society to contributing to its growth, development, and resilience. Hence, often at the end of their lifespans, they are “preserved” for their historical value through renovation. Considerations for renovation often include their historical significance, structural integrity, adaptive reuse, social sustainability, financial viability, and environmental impacts. Among these considerations, the carbon emissions associated with a project are increasingly becoming a factor of relevance when a historical building is to be sensitively renovated so that it can continue to contribute to local sustainability. However, embodied carbon is often overshadowed by operational carbon and overlooked in the development of renovation options. This paper argues for the need to include embodied carbon in the consideration of any renovation process and for guidelines for doing so. The argument is built upon a systematic review of current practices in the renovation of industrial heritage buildings across selected representative countries from the Global South and the Global North, in the belief that the former could learn valuable lessons from the latter, which has more extensive experience in considering embodied carbon in such processes. The argument also shows the difference in policy between different countries and articulates how the inclusion of embodied carbon might support environmental targets in the Global South. Based on a quantitative comparison, this review explains why embodied carbon (EC) is missing in renovations of industrial heritage buildings in the Global South. This study estimates the proportion and value of EC within the total life cycle in renovations of industrial buildings to support the argument. Above all, a calculation using a standard life cycle assessment (LCA) tool (ISO14040 & 14044) applied to four successful examples and a quantitative comparison highlight the benefits of including embodied carbon in renovations of industrial buildings and the carbon savings in the Global South and further supports our argument.

AB  - The construction of an ecologically livable city has emerged as a crucial objective in Guangzhou's “14th Five-Year Plan” and the vision for 2035. This paper establishes an evaluation index system for urban ecological livability, encompassing five dimensions: economy, society, technology, environment, and nature. It employs the TOPSIS analysis method and a coupling coordination model to conduct a trend analysis of the evaluation values and coupling coordination degrees of these five systems in Guangzhou from 2014 to 2023. The findings indicate: (1) the overall ecological livability of Guangzhou shows a positive trend, with a relatively favorable development level; however, the progress of each system is constrained by various factors. (2) Since 2015, the coupling degree of the five systems has gradually increased, maintaining a good state since 2017. The calculations of coordination degree reveal a steady rise in the overall system's coupling coordination. This study enhances the index system for ecologically livable cities and offers policy recommendations to strengthen urban ecological livability, thereby providing valuable guidance for promoting sustainable urban development and the construction of ecologically livable cities.

AB  - This article shows what kind of urban spaces are produced by circular systems. The focus is on the socio-spatial dimension of closed material loops in two neighbourhoods (e.g., reuse of grey water, recycling of waste, provision of renewable energy). Although the Circular Economy (CE) narrative is increasingly part of urban transformation policies, there are considerable implementation gaps in how regenerative or self-sufficient systems are operationalised in practice. I argue that the application of circularity principles in the urban context requires conceptual clarification to be useful for urban theory and praxis. Therefore, I provide a political ecology perspective of circular urban systems by analysing two cases: Block 6 in Berlin and Schoonschip in Amsterdam. I explain how such systems were established, who benefits from them, and what kind of socio-spatial conditions they produce. Methodologically, I use several qualitative research methods in the framework of a case study analysis. The results show that the incremental and publicly financed low-tech development of circular systems is socially compatible while privately funded high-tech developments result in stronger levels of sustainability but are reserved to a small exclusive group of people and provoke gentrification processes.

AB  - The circular economy (CE) is a multidisciplinary approach focused on achieving the sustainability of the whole society. This review aims to reveal the potential impact of the circular economy on quality of life. This systematic review analyzes studies dealing with the concept of circular economy and quality of life. The methodology process included a keyword search and three selection steps. A total of 39 studies were included in the analysis. We define four topics that emerged from the literature review i) urban sustainable development; ii) waste management; iii) material production and iv) human well-being. All these topics emerged in the literature dealing with issues of circular economy and its impact on the quality of life. We assume that it is implied that every step towards circular economy contributes to the life quality, but there is an evident lack of studies that measure that impact. In Serbia, a small number of researchers were involved in this topic, although it represents one step towards the objective of improving the state of the environment. This review of the literature should serve as a starting point for future research.

AB  - Urbanization, an unavoidable global process, has driven land use change, impacted ecosystem services, and induced serious environmental problems. As a result, urban planning is a critical issue in sustainable development. In this study, we developed a framework to quantify how urbanization influences ecosystem services (ESs) in order to provide suggestions for urban planning during large scale urban agglomeration in northwestern China. We separated the region into three sub-regions (developed urban, developing urban, and rural areas), quantified five critical ESs (crop production, carbon storage, nutrient retention, sand fixation, and habitat quality), analyzed the relationships (trade-off, synergy, and bundle) among ES changes, and investigated the impacts of urbanization on these ESs. The results show that urbanization results in large scale reclamation and small scale deforestation in rural areas; it comprehensively results in an increase of four ESs (not habitat quality). Urban expansion mainly occurs in developing urban areas and causes a decrease in four ESs (not sand fixation). Based on temporal change in ESs, synergy relationships exist among them, except for between nutrient retention and crop production, which have an insignificant correlation. Urban expansion would strengthen the synergy relationships among regulating services, while green infrastructure in core urban areas would weaken these relationships. Based on the spatial distribution of ES change, two bundles were identified among the five ESs: 1) crop production, carbon storage, and nutrient retention; and 2) sand fixation and habitat quality. Based on these findings, several suggestions for urban expansion and land use planning are proposed to achieve an optimized balance between urbanization and ES protection. Investigating the impacts of rapid urbanization on ESs and their relationships could provide scientifically based suggestions for urban planning according to ES protection, sustainable urban development, and human well-being.

AB  - Notwithstanding several policy initiatives in many countries over a number of years, there remains a general sense that too much municipal solid waste is generated and that too much of the waste that is generated is landfilled. There is an emerging consensus that a sustainable approach to waste management requires further development of secondary raw material markets. The purpose of this paper is to propose a theoretical economic model that focuses upon this stage of a sustainable waste management program and explores policy options that could motivate efficiency in secondary raw material markets. In particular, we show how firm profit and social welfare optimizing objectives can be reconciled in a two-product market of waste management processes: landfilling and material reclamation. Our results provide theoretical support for building out recent Circular Economy initiatives as well as for the relatively recent emergence of landfill mining as a means for procuring secondary raw materials.

AB  - Urban areas experience high carbon emissions, impeding sustainable development, and causing global environmental changes. Low-carbon planning and lifestyle have the co-benefit of reducing carbon emissions and mediating environmental threats. However, the relationship among carbon emissions, urban form, and lifestyle remains unclear, limiting low-carbon urban and societal development. Thus, the objective of this study was to simultaneously clarify the direct and indirect influences and pathways of lifestyle (i.e., expenditures on diet, housing, transport, and entertainment) and urban form characteristics (i.e., dispersion, patch area, fragmentation, and aggregation of building patches) on carbon emissions, and identify vital factors for mitigating carbon emissions. Moreover, a partial least squares model was established and analyzed using urban-scale data from 352 townships in Taiwan, which was used at novel spatial scales. The empirical results demonstrate that maximizing the building patch area and minimizing the dispersion, fragmentation, and aggregation of building patches can reduce carbon emissions. Furthermore, minimizing expenditures on diet, housing, transport, and entertainment would have a similar effect. The findings established that proper policies for lifestyle and urban form can reduce carbon emissions and serve as useful strategies for developing low-carbon societies and cities.

AB  - Traditional engineering approaches alone (gray infrastructure) are not able to meet all the challenges of sustainability posed by growing urban population and consumption. Urban Green and Blue Infrastructure (GBI) can provide cost-effective treatments, and help the achievement of several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, knowledge concerning how to innovate GBI strategically in cities remains limited. Together with the others in the special issue, this article aims to enhance understanding of the potential of city-based GBI to tackle local and global challenges practically, and provide theoretical discussions on sustainable transitions and future research on urban GBI. Via envisioning and implementation of integrated urban innovations for GBI, the ecosystem services derived from these nature-based solutions can contribute directly and indirectly to SDG achievement at various scales by increasing water and food security, reducing energy consumption, as by supporting urban biodiversity, health, and life quality. GBI can also contribute to discussions related to such emerging concepts as circular economy, urban transitions, and smart cities.

AB  - The current energy transition focuses on decarbonisation through the use of renewable energy sources, coupled with improvements in efficiency by means of technological innovations. However, there is also a clear call for realizing a just transition. The implementation of smart technology-led transitions and low-carbon energy system innovations is increasingly urged to become more people-centred by taking energy poverty and other justice related issues into account. Energy justice and energy poverty debates already transcend narrow foci on income and energy expenditure ratios and have moved towards multidimensional approaches (Bouzarovski and Petrova, 2015) [1]. In addition, the capability approach (CA) has been used to understand energy deprivation (Day et al., 2016) [2]. We further develop these approaches to better understand justice relevant issues within Positive Energy Districts, especially by looking at how opportunity spaces for realizing wellbeing are created. The primary goal is to establish a CA-informed framework for analysing justice-relevant issues within the development of Positive Energy Districts, based on a systematic literature search. Hereby we contribute to the discussion on usage of the CA within the field of energy and to the debate on how to frame technological innovations, such that they can contribute to a just transition.

AB  - Context Rapid urbanisation and economic growth have intensified challenges such as water scarcity and flood management in urban areas. Addressing these issues requires enhanced water-management strategies to support sustainable urban development.Aims This study aims to refine the framework for water-saving initiatives in cities, crucial for implementing stringent water-management practices and addressing complex water challenges, thereby contributing to sustainable economic and social progress.Methods Using the analytic hierarchy process, a comprehensive evaluation model for urban water-resource management was developed. This model integrates an evaluation index system that considers social, economic and environmental benefits, promoting sustainable development and the circular economy.Key results The developed model successfully enables both quantitative and qualitative assessments of urban water-resource management strategies. It offers a more streamlined and accurate methodology for evaluating the regional water-resource carrying capacity, surpassing the precision and usability of existing models.Conclusions The study underscores the critical role of advanced water-resource management strategies in urban environments. It demonstrated that integrated approaches are essential for addressing the multifaceted challenges of urban water management and for promoting urban sustainability.Implications This research provides actionable insights for policymakers, highlighting the necessity of incorporating comprehensive evaluation models in urban water management. By emphasising the integration of social, economic and environmental benefits, it supports the advancement of sustainable water-use practices and promotes ecological and social equity. This study introduces a new model for evaluating urban water management, blending social, economic and environmental factors. The model helps cities better assess and manage their water resources, promoting sustainability and economic progress. By improving water-saving strategies and addressing urban water challenges, the research offers valuable insights for policymakers aiming for sustainable urban development.This article belongs to the collection Ecological Monitoring and Assessment of Freshwater Ecosystems: New Trends and Future Challenges.

AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated some advantages of using advanced heuristic algorithms to identify near-Pareto-optimal future locations, types, and sizes for stormwater low-impact development and green infrastructure (LID/GI) across a given urban landscape. However, previous optimization studies did not consider social equity as an objective, which poses problems because urban green infrastructure often is distributed inequitably. Increasing access to LID/GI in historically marginalized areas is a prominent environmental justice issue, and increasingly is becoming a primary consideration when prioritizing future locations, types, and sizes of urban LID/GI. This study integrated a novel spatial social equity objective [LID/GI-Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) correlation objective, ?] into a multiobjective LID/GI optimization model. The LID/GI-SVI correlation is an objective that directs the optimization algorithm to search for LID/GI distributions that maximize the linear correlation between LID/GI implementation and subbasins with higher estimated percentages of historically marginalized people. Our analysis focused on understanding the impacts of the LID/GI-SVI correlation objective on a LID/GI optimization model. This modeling study demonstrates that (1) the LID/GI-SVI correlation objective can be used to direct optimization algorithms to search for LID/GI distributions that can achieve runoff management objectives, increase green LID/GI implementation in more marginalized areas, and explore the potential trade-offs or synergies between hydrologic and equity goals; (2) LID/GI optimization formulations that consider only hydrologic objectives likely will not result in equitable LID/GI distributions; (3) LID/GI distributions that perform well on the LID/GI-SVI correlation may be composed of different types of LID/GI than less-equitable but more hydrologically favorable LID/GI distributions; and (4) for our study area, including spatial equity as an objective resulted in modest reductions in the hydrologic performance of near-Pareto-optimal LID/GI distributions.

AB  - The introduction of effective solid waste management strategies in developing countries should be considered for improving sustainability at global level. Many barriers should be overcome, concerning the introduction of environmental policies, effective investments, social inclusion and public awareness, which are significant issues in low-middle income countries. The Circular Economy could represent the answer for improving current solid waste management activities worldwide, since denote the principle of waste valorization and recycling for boosting developing economies. This paper is focused on this theme, analyzing main opportunities for improving the current state of solid waste management in developing big cities. The solid waste management of two countries are reviewed: Romania is the emerging country where Circular Economy is becoming a future objective due to economic aids and strength regulations which the European Union (EU) established for the nations forming parts the alliance; as a comparison, Bolivia is reported for evaluating main differences founded for developing recycling systems in a no-EU country. These two case studies could be of interest for highlighting main pros and cons of the participation into a wide organization like the EU for introducing in short terms Circular Economy principles. Moreover, a theoretical Circular Economy model for developing big cities in low-middle income countries is described within the study for effectively comparing which chances can spread for these countries as regard municipal solid waste exploitation. Despite the economic level, Romania and Bolivia are both facing with many solid waste management issues although in different magnitude. For the Romanian case study, it is visible how it cannot achieve the European goals for 2020 due the need of change in public recycling behavior. Bolivia, instead, represents the case where international aids and new investments are required, considering the informal sector into the formal management system as a real opportunity for improving local recycling rate. In conclusion, the comparison suggests how external supports led to implement the principles of the Circular Economy within a developing region. The model of Circular Economy proposed is recommended for developing big cities in order to advance a new form of safe employment, encouraging the activities that are still in action (i.e. informal sector) and boosting the principles of sustainable development.

AB  - Municipal solid waste (MSW) management is a global concern, especially in low–middle-income countries such as Pakistan, which require the redressal of MSW treatment issues to attain sustainability in the waste sector. The prosperity of municipal solid waste (MSW) collectors, i.e., the sanitary workers, is critical in the waste management hierarchy. Hence, the health, safety, social welfare, economic conditions and overall wellbeing of this tier need to be focused on more. Safeguarding the interests of the sanitary workers will support the MSW management sector in sustainability, which will help to generate revenue and minimize climatic impacts. An innovative MSW business model with waste ownership and technological intervention has excellent potential to support the sector towards a circular economy in Pakistan, the fifth most populous country in the world, generating about 100,000 metric tons of MSW per day. The proposed recycling business model will ensure a daily material recovery of 26,070 tons with 4721 tons of compost manufacturing in the country, which ultimately helps towards achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and meeting the targets of nationally determined contributors (NDCs) by 2030. In addition, the sector’s economic potential can contribute 5.5% to the total annual budget and possibly pay 1.4% of the gross domestic product (GDP) per annum to service national foreign debt, thus helping maintain the debt threshold value with an opportunity to accelerate the economic growth of Pakistan.

AB  - With this article, the author will try to outline the relationship between environmental urbanism, the urban economy and policies to build sustainable cities of the future. Given that worldwide attention is being paid to the problems of climate change, which go hand in hand with the creation of sustainable architecture, which uses green technologies to build a modern city, where the application of the environmental approach is seen as a means of healing and planning the modern city of the future. The emerging trend of increasing population in economically active centers worldwide determines the development of the entire economy of each country, including Bulgaria. And so in the formed, economically active centers many interesting processes take place, determining the rhythm of the economic everyday life of a huge part of the city's population, which requires a detailed analysis justifying the process of forming policies for building sustainable cities of the future. It is for the creation of sustainable cities of the future that it is necessary to implement spatial strategic planning, which should include the basic concepts and concepts based on ecological urbanism, green and circular economy in order to overcome the chaos in urban development, especially in Eastern Europe. For example, the chaotic development of tourism in the Burgas region creates the emergence of unsolvable problems, despite the fact that there has been an increase in visits. Creating the right infrastructure must be seen as one of the most important prerequisites for attracting strategic investors. On the other hand, we should not ignore the fact that in a number of sectors there is a shortage of staff, who are expelled from small settlements by low pay, from lack of economic opportunities for realization on the labor market. As well as the slow pace with which small settlements are developing and local problems are being solved, which require active and thinking local government. Urbanization in Europe is a growing phenomenon, both in terms of increasing urban space and in terms of the growing share of the population. Urban growth has different dimensions, in every country in the world, and the line between urban and rural areas is increasingly blurred. Especially given that in recent years there has been a tendency to significantly increase the share of suburban areas compared to the level of development of traditional central urban areas. This process implies to pay additional attention on the one hand to the process of developing new strategies and tools for planning and forecasting for the development and creation of sustainable links between rural and urban land use, and on the other hand to look for opportunities to meet modern challenges for the protection of the environment and the building of sustainable cities of the future. A number of cities in the country and the world face various challenges related to social, economic and environmental problems arising from the increasing importance of factors - overcrowding, social inequality, pollution, increased traffic, etc. Therefore, one of the main challenges to the development of modern sustainable cities of the future, on the one hand is to achieve a balance between population density and compactness of cities, and on the other hand to improve the quality of life in building and maintaining a healthy urban environment. Significant attention must be paid to the process of integrating policies at national, regional and local levels in the application of new forms of urban planning and management to reap the full benefits of urbanization.

AB  - PurposeThis study aims to investigate the state-of-the-art in economic sustainability (EcS) and social sustainability (ScS) of prefabricated construction (PFC), addressing gaps in holistic life cycle perspectives.Design/methodology/approachA bibliometric analysis and a content-based critical review were used to synthesise literature on EcS and ScS of PFC.FindingsResults reveal that life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA), social life cycle assessment and additive manufacturing are emerging themes. EcS is more extensively researched than ScS, with developed regions dominating case studies. While PFC marginally outperforms conventional methods in most EcS and ScS evaluations, critical gaps persist in indicator diversity, stakeholder representation and data availability. Challenges related to methodological immaturity and data availability are discussed in depth, leading to an improvement strategy framework proposal. The discussion emphasises how holistic sustainability assessments, circular economy (CE) principles and alignment with sustainable development goals (SDGs) can position PFC as a driver for sustainable urban development. A future research agenda should prioritise methodological advancements, case-specific studies (e.g. CE), LCSA and SDG-aligned policies and decision support systems to enhance sustainability decision-making in PFC.Originality/valueAlthough environmental sustainability in PFC is well-examined, economic and social dimensions remain underexplored. A holistic life cycle approach that integrates CE principles and SDGs can better reveal performance, assessment methods, system boundaries and gaps, ultimately driving global sustainable development, construction innovation and technological progress.

AB  - Public health risks such as obesity are influenced by numerous personal characteristics, but the local spatial structure such as an area's built environment can also affect the obesity rate. This study analyzes and discusses how a greenbelt plan as a tool of urban containment policy has an effect on obesity. This study conducted spatial econometric regression models with five factors (13 variables) including transportation, socio-economic, public health, region, and policy factors. The relationship was analyzed between two policy effects of a greenbelt (i.e., a green buffer zone) and obesity. The variables for two policy effects of greenbelt zones are the size of the greenbelt and the inside and outside areas of the greenbelt. The results indicate that the two variables have negative effects on obesity. The results of the analyses in this study have several policy implications. Greenbelts play a role as an urban growth management policy, leading to a reduced obesity rate due to the influence of the transportation mode. In addition, greenbelts can also reduce the obesity rate because they provide recreation spaces for people.Public health risks such as obesity are influenced by numerous personal characteristics, but the local spatial structure such as an area's built environment can also affect the obesity rate.

AB  - Social Impact Assessment can be considered a branch of Environmental Impact Assessment that has become a tool in its own right due to the focus that was paid to the natural and physical issues within the EIA process. However there are still strong alignments and the wise project planner will integrate social and environmental issues within their project planning process. This can be done through a combination of studies but can result in a single report. The benefits of SIA are demonstrated to include: obtaining approvals; forward planning and design; increased project success (benefits to local community); economic benefits; and decision making by management. The types of impacts including demographic, socio-economic, health, social infrastructure, resources, psychological and community, cultural and social equity are reviewed. Methods and techniques to identify and assess impacts are addressed. Meanwhile, one of the main challenges in SIA is to reach the right audience. Methods to scope studies and implement consultation will be addressed.

AB  - Ecological design is crucial in shaping contemporary, resilient, and livable cities. The Santa Cruz de Tenerife Refinery, a prominent landmark in the Mid-Atlantic, serves as an exemplary case study for understanding advanced metropolitan processes and integrating trans-scalar, transdisciplinary, and nature-based solutions (NBS) practices into urban contexts. This article explores the challenges of transforming obsolete industrial areas, including the refinery’s decommissioning process, its port, and industrial heritage value, and their relationship with the sea, into vibrant urban cores. It examines innovative strategies for land use, decontamination, and urban resilience, which are vital for fostering adaptability and recovery from natural and anthropogenic disasters. By emphasizing the refinery’s connection to Santa Cruz de Tenerife and its metropolitan area, as well as its coastal interface, this study proposes a comprehensive methodology to assess the territorial impacts of urban processes and guide project decisions toward enhancing the quality of life for the region’s residents.

AB  - Nature-based solutions are quickly rising to the top of the sustainable urban development agenda as an ecosystem-based approach to mitigate and adapt to climate change, while also improving livelihoods and biodiversity. Achieving sustainability and resilience through nature-based solutions is an important means for cities and communities across the globe to take climate action and experiment with new forms governance, infrastructure, and planning and design. In this paper, I map the academic research structure of nature-based solutions and find that issues of social and environmental justice remain peripheral. To center justice in research and practice, I argue for a re-orientation towards just nature-based solutions-approaches that utilize the power of nature and people to transform the social, political, and economic drivers of socio-spatial inequality and environmental degradation into opportunities to create progressive, cohesive, antiracist, and social-ecologically sustainable communities. Based on the findings of the literature review and bibliometric analysis, I propose three pathways for just nature-based solutions: (1) race and class; (2) transformative co-production; and (3) value articulations. These starting points link to current principles in nature-based solutions and help bring clarity for scholars, activists, and planners on how to critically engage with the politics of environmental governance and decision-making.

AB  - Buildings are energy- and resource-hungry: their construction and use account for around 39% of global carbon dioxide emissions; they consume around 40% of all the energy produced; they are responsible for over 35% of the EU's total waste generation; and account for about 50% of all extracted (fossil) materials. Therefore, they present a significant challenge to meeting national and international Net Zero targets of reducing greenhouse emissions and fossil resource use. The CircularB Project, is at the heart of this issue, which will underpin synergies of multi-scale circular perspectives (from materials, to components, to assets and built environments), digital transformation solutions, data-driven and complexity science, stakeholder behavioral science, and interdisciplinary capabilities towards achievable, affordable and marketable circular solutions for both new and existing buildings, for sustainable urban design, and for circular built environments across Europe. This paper contributes to the project by deriving new insights into the stakeholders’ influences, inter-relationships, and obstacles in the implementation of circular economy concepts on existing building stocks in Europe, which represent over 90% of whole building assets. In order to identify and derive the insights, our study is rigorously based on (i) a robust critical literature review of key documentations such as articles, standards, policy reports, strategic roadmaps and white papers; and (ii) interviews with relevant stakeholders and decision makers. Uniquely, our work spans across all scales of CE implementation from materials, to products and components, to existing building stocks, and to living built environments. The findings point out the current challenges and obstacles required to be tackled. Inadequacies of financial incentives and governmental enforcement (via policy, legislation, or directive) are commonly found to be the most critical obstacles found throughout Europe. Circular economy is the global challenge and not just a single country can resolve the climate issue without the cooperation of other countries. The insights thus highlight the essential need for harmonized actions and tactical/pragmatic policies promoted and regulated by the European Commission, national and local governments who can dominate the influence, promote inter-relationship, and overcome the barriers towards circular economy much more effectively.

AB  - IntroductionModern development is patented by rapid urbanization, which largely negatively affects the quality of life. Over the past few decades in the World; in the field of urban planning and the real estate market, Mixed-use development has become a Centre of attention. Karachi is the mega city with the highest population in Pakistan. Gulshan-e Iqbal is considered an upper to upper-middle-class income group residential place where mostly vertical development is observed. Soon the area gets popular for living, and road-facing flats started to engage in Residential cum commercial activities i.e., mixed-used development problems (traffic jams, people's regular mobility, etc.) for residents arose and as the area got crowded day by day these problems became more critical. The present research aimed to examine the land-use type, and its distribution in the area of Gulshan-e-Iqbal I, and investigate the causes of the failure of Mixed-Use Neighborhood development and to prove the problem environmental impact assessment of the area have also been done.Materials and methodsObject-based analyses have been conducted on a very high-resolution image of the SAS planet, Digitization has been done on the image later classified into 14 major classes. After attempting the strategic objective identification of issues causing Mobility, an inductive approach (Resident Survey) to analyze the resident perception and to validate issues raised due to mixed-use development, Environmental Impact Analysis has been done. Air Quality of study area has been done, in this regard PM 10 ppm, PM 1 ppm, PM 2.5, CO, CO2, and TVOC have been conducted for different timings. Wind Velocity has also been recorded for the same locations.Results and discussionIt has been investigated that mixed-use development is spread over the entire area by different ratios i.e., 7.3% by functional land-use, 24% of mixed-use development occupied 24% of total land-use in the area. From public perception, it is concluded that most people have their cars even more than two, and 66.7% park their cars on the streets rather than inside their premises. PM10 ppm values are higher along major roads and expressways and mixed-use development zones. PM2.5 reading is higher (249–267 ppm) at the mixed-use development. The overall Gulshan e Iqbal 1 is under the influence of PM1 pollution i.e., ranged from 153 to 248 ppm. The maximum emission (67–73 ppm) of Carbon monoxide is found at ATMs. The vast spread of CO2 in the atmosphere but along the main roads and interjections i.e., 342 ppm while the highest reading reached up to 800. TVOC is commonly found in congested places where there is more transport in limited areas. Wind velocity is found where the built-up structure is compact wind velocity is ultimately low but the concentration of pollution is higher.Conclusions and recommendationsThis study will be helpful to plan a suitable planning strategy to reduce the daily havoc generated by the constant flux of traffic, for urban development and sustainability.

AB  - The phenomenon of rapid urbanization indeed presents a complex array of challenges for land-use planning, especially in the context of agricultural drylands transitioning into peri-urban and urban lands. Urbanization trends in 2020 reached about 60%, with projections indicating that urbanization will increase to about 70% by 2030. The transformation from rural to urban characteristics affects not only the physical agricultural drylands but also the socioeconomic and ecological dynamics of the region. The shift from rural to increasingly urban characteristics brings about multifaceted challenges and opportunities for land-use planning, and multifunctional landscape shows a wide diversity of ecosystem functions, which is generally ensured by landscape biodiversity. The aims and objectives of the study were to promote sustainable development, enhance food security, support urban resilience, protect agricultural land, integrate peri-urban and urban systems, promote efficient land usage, and ensure environmental safety. Here, we incorporated primary data obtained using a close-ended survey questionnaire through a nonprobability convenience sampling technique. The sample size of the study comprised 680 participants, and we employed a structural equation model in two steps for analytical purposes: confirmatory factor analysis and path analysis. The findings revealed that amenity, landscape and recreational value, and proximity significantly affect peri-urban areas and urban agricultural drylands (B = 0.204, p-value = 0.00 < 0.05; B = 0.204, p-value = 0.00 < 0.05; B = 0.124, p-value = 0.051 < 0.01; B = 0.28, p-value = 0.00 < 0.01; B = 0.445, p-value = 0.00 < 0.01; B = 0.197, p-value = 0.00 < 0.01). The existing large rural lots in China's Tianjin region were found to negatively affect the level of urbanization (B = −0.25, p-value = 0.00 < 0.01) and urban agricultural dryland (B = −0.256, p-value = 0.00 < 0.01). A mediating effect of the level of urbanization was also found (B = 0.045, p-value = 0.01 < 0.05; B = 0.026, p-value = 0.041 < 0.05; B = −0.032, p-value = 0.03 < 0.05; B = 0.128, p-value = 0.02 < 0.05). We conclude that amenity, landscape and recreational value, and proximity significantly influence peri-urban areas and agricultural drylands. This study enlightened the urban professional planners, which includes urban designers, landscape designers, and architects, along with Chinese social planners, although no mediating effect on the level of urbanization was observed between land-use planning and peri-urban areas. Land-use planning in peri-urban and urban agricultural drylands should be multifunctional, integrating urban food systems into urban planning, promoting sustainable land management, and considering the mediating effects of urbanization levels to enhance urban resilience and sustainability. The limitation of the study outlined the impact of peri-urban agriculture within the context of the Tianjin region of China. Therefore, the outcome of the current study may not apply to other regions. As such, we recommend repeating the current study in regions other than China of developed and developing countries.

AB  - A low-carbon energy transition is essential for mitigating climate change, but can also cause energy justice and equity impacts on Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), low-income, and other frontline communities. Examples include exacerbating energy burden, inaccessibility and unaffordability of low-carbon energy and electric end-use technologies, property value loss and displacement from renewable energy siting, and unequal health benefits and employment losses from fossil fuel retirement. To avoid perpetuating historical and creating new injustices, an equitable and just energy transition will require careful planning and execution. To this end, measuring and evaluating the effects of existing and proposed programs and policies aimed at decarbonizing energy systems is critical. However, methods and metrics for evaluating equity effects vary across disciplines and transitions, making it challenging to identify effective evaluation strategies. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the equity implications of low-carbon energy transitions and identifies key metrics that have been used across disciplines to quantify energy injustices and equity impacts. We focus on four key low-carbon energy transitions: (1) renewable energy deployment; (2) fossil fuel infrastructure retirement; (3) transportation electrification; and (4) residential building decarbonization. We classify energy justice and equity metrics into the dimensions of health, access, and livelihood, and construct an analytical framework that supports policymakers, planners and other stakeholders in identifying important equity considerations and quantitatively evaluating the effects of decarbonization initiatives. While our framework can serve as a starting point for evaluating justice and equity impacts of energy transitions, further work is needed to address the limitations of existing metrics and additional evaluation methods will be critical to effect energy transitions that are truly equitable.

AB  - Although state and local growth management programs vary widely, nearly all such programs include one common feature: they require local governments to plan. While there has been extensive research on the effects of growth management in general and on specific policy instruments to manage urban growth there has been little research on the effects of planning. In this paper we present a game-theoretic model of urban development in which a rational local government plans. The model illustrates how planning can serve to guide local government decision making, how land market participants might respond to local government plans, and how planning in a dynamic context can increase social welfare. By considering local government as a player who plans rather than as an external disturbance that might regulate, we can discover insights and frame hypotheses about the efficacy of planning that are not possible in other urban economic models.

AB  - India’s urbanisation is considered the largest national urban transformation of the 21st century, with its trajectory having a decisive impact on carbon emissions globally. This study defines and operationalises the concept of energy sufficiency for the growth of Indian cities which is expected to be largely driven by low- and middle-income housing. It combines theoretical framing with quantitative assessment of test models to present an operational framework of energy sufficiency that can be implemented through urban planning regulations. Based on the global budgetary limit to restrict global warming to 1.5°C, a precautionary target of 1.0 tCO2 per capita per year is estimated as an energy sufficiency allowance for upcoming residential built environments. By optimising the average dwelling size, limiting the land-use intensity to low-rise (four storeys) and compact urban forms, and improving operational energy performance with adaptive thermal comfort, the carbon emissions from residential buildings can be sufficiently optimised to 0.84 tCO2 per capita per year. The integration of rooftop renewable energy can further reduce it to 0.56 tCO2. The co-benefits of the optimised costs of construction and operation make the case for economic feasibility and wider affordability.Policy relevanceThe rapid urbanisation in India will significantly increase carbon emissions from the urban built environment. Current trends towards high-rise and high-density residential development contribute significantly to the demand for embodied and operational energy. However, these remain unaccounted for in India’s action plan to meet its nationally determined contribution (NDC) to reduce emissions intensity. Energy sufficiency can be used as a guiding principle for urbanising contexts to limit both the embodied energy of new residential buildings and the associated operational energy demands. The proposed framework for sufficiency serves as a useful policy instrument, capable of being translated to actionable urban planning regulations. By demonstrating the potential of a ‘sufficient’ per capita carbon emissions budget for the growth and regeneration of residential buildings, this framework equips planners to set limits for the height and density of the built environment, fostering a low-carbon future aligned with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

AB  - Sprawling land development patterns have exacerbated ecological degradation, social fragmentation, and public health problems. Perverse incentives arise from the ability to privatize collectively created value in land rents and socialize ecological costs. Land value taxation (LVT) has been shown to encourage urban infill development by reducing or eliminating rent-seeking behavior in land markets. However, despite its purported benefits, this tax reform is value monistic in its definition of optimal land use and, therefore, does little to address the lack of non-market information to inform land use decisions. We propose an ecological-impact-weighted land value taxation policy (ELVT) which incorporates the ecological footprint of land use into one's land value tax burden. We test both proposed policies (LVT and ELVT) relative to a "status quo" (SQ) property tax scheme, utilizing a conceptual spatially explicit agent-based model of land use behaviors and housing development. Our findings suggest that both tax interventions can increase the capital intensity and decrease the land intensity of housing development. Furthermore, both tax interventions can lead to a net profit loss for speculators and a decrease in the average housing unit price. The ELVT scheme is shown to significantly increase urban nature provisions and dampen the loss of ecological value across a region.

AB  - Roman law demonstrated a concern for public health and urban habitat, implementing regulations that, although primitive, shared objectives with our current environmental legislation. In Rome, the reuse of construction materials was considered legitimate due to its economic and architectural significance, prioritizing restoration over new construction and regulating reuse to prevent urban degradation. Likewise, there was a market for second-hand materials, tied to speculation from deliberate demolitions, and a functional approach to recycling for public works. Although waste was not prioritized as it is under the Circular Economy framework of Spain's Law 7/2022 on Waste and Contaminated Land, Roman practices foreshadowed embryonic forms of circular economy, emphasizing efficiency in debris management and material transportation. These precedents reflect principles that have influenced the shaping of modern environmental administrative law, aimed at mitigating urban ecological impacts and fostering resilience.

AB  - The complex challenge of managing urban growth and development in the context of climate and environmental change has led to a proliferation of policy discourses related to the 'green city'. While useful as a buzzword, it is argued that green city discourses often overlook or even mask questions of social and environmental justice. This case study of Phnom Penh, Cambodia, shows that the presence of green and sustainable city discourses in policymaking does not reflect the reality of urban planning practices. Instead, it has produced an urban vision reflective of the priorities of global capital while contributing to the ongoing destruction of urban biodiversity and the marginalization of urban residents living in poverty. It is argued that a reconceptualization of the green city be undertaken, which incorporates understanding of participatory and distributive justice to ensure that urban planning practices are inclusive and sustainable.

AB  - Climate change is the most pressing sustainability issue of our time, with anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions causing economic, environmental, and human health impacts. We need to achieve net-zero civil infrastructure systems to limit global temperature increases. Energy production and supply, transportation, buildings, and industry are examples of civil infrastructure systems. Examining the full scope of impacts throughout the conception, design, construction, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning of infrastructure systems will allow for improved mitigation and adaptation planning. Current planning processes and mechanisms will need to be transformed to achieve 'climate-smart' infrastructure that focus on thoughtful minimization of impacts, cooperation with communities, and understanding the implications of failing to act. Social equity is often left as an afterthought in environmentally conscious infrastructure planning. Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is the most complete and decision-powerful model for cataloging environmental impacts of a system. However, the methodology has limitations regarding how it might be leveraged to support multicriteria decision-making in decarbonizing our civil infrastructure systems, such as when trying to account for community preferences, an important element of a just transition. Future planning for the decarbonization of our built environment would benefit from a multi-criteria approach that encompasses elements of LCA, equity, and stakeholder collaboration, the latter two of which are key tenets for advancing environmental justice.

AB  - An unequal distribution of green areas across cities coupled with the vulnerability towards climate change and global warming is causing segregation between residents who profit from nature-based solutions'(NbS) health and wellbeing benefits and those who do not. Residential segregation in urban settings goes far beyond income and socio-economic factors and is also evident in questions of environmental justice, participation and power - including how and where NbS are implemented. Delving into Greek cities, this paper raises the question of whether and how engagement with urban NbS differs within cities and among their residents. By applying a survey with an integrated discrete choice experiment (N = 1002) we were able to analyze the relevance of the type of green area, the effectiveness in temperature and microdust reduction, biodiversity enhancement, time and financial payments and the importance of participatory planning processes. The latent class analysis showed that urban segregation is recognizable within the sample. By investigating the differences in ability and willingness to support urban NbS, this paper recommends how green infrastructure can be implemented in a manner which enforces a more just distribution for those who need it most.

AB  - Land use change is the most prominent feature of Chinese urbanisation. In China, the expansion of land consumed for urban development is inevitable given the rapid increases in the urban economy and urban population, but also in meeting the population’s increasing demand for better quality of life. This paper is based on a research study of Wujiang district in Suzhou, which is considered representative of many of the rapid urbanisation areas within the nation. The objective is to develop an in-depth understanding of the characteristics of land use change and how this change contributes to environmental deterioration, as assessed by changes in the ecosystem service value (ESV). In this study, ESV is defined as the environmental products and functions provided for human well-being. Based on local planning documents, Landsat TM remote-sensing images and field surveys, the research analyses the cost to the environment when traditional land uses are transformed into urbanisation. The research demonstrates that conversion to urban land use which ignores the limit and capacity of the environment can generate significant environmental costs, as assessed by ESV, which in turn, can lead to a deterioration of quality of life for inhabitants, the exact opposite of the original intention. The research demonstrates that by mapping the spatial distribution of ecological service values, ESV can be used as a guide to urban sustainable development.

AB  - Purpose This study aims to investigate the state-of-the-art in economic sustainability (EcS) and social sustainability (ScS) of prefabricated construction (PFC), addressing gaps in holistic life cycle perspectives. Design/methodology/approach A bibliometric analysis and a content-based critical review were used to synthesise literature on EcS and ScS of PFC. Findings Results reveal that life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA), social life cycle assessment and additive manufacturing are emerging themes. EcS is more extensively researched than ScS, with developed regions dominating case studies. While PFC marginally outperforms conventional methods in most EcS and ScS evaluations, critical gaps persist in indicator diversity, stakeholder representation and data availability. Challenges related to methodological immaturity and data availability are discussed in depth, leading to an improvement strategy framework proposal. The discussion emphasises how holistic sustainability assessments, circular economy (CE) principles and alignment with sustainable development goals (SDGs) can position PFC as a driver for sustainable urban development. A future research agenda should prioritise methodological advancements, case-specific studies (e.g. CE), LCSA and SDG-aligned policies and decision support systems to enhance sustainability decision-making in PFC. Originality/value Although environmental sustainability in PFC is well-examined, economic and social dimensions remain underexplored. A holistic life cycle approach that integrates CE principles and SDGs can better reveal performance, assessment methods, system boundaries and gaps, ultimately driving global sustainable development, construction innovation and technological progress.

AB  - New transit development often try to provide low-carbon mobility, and improve accessibility. However, it is often unclear who profits most from new transit developments, whether these transit developments can improve equity, and if yes, in which dimensions. Here we study the change in quality of life, instrumentalised as perceived and measured social capital, socio-economic well-being, and quality of public infrastructure after transit developments in Medellin, Columbia. We make use of a detailed questionnaire of 187 questions from 2009 and 2012, aggregate responses into 14 indicators, and compare changes in quality of life between three transit developments zones (comunas), three non-intervention zones, and between income levels and gender. We find that equity improved overall across geographical zones, income, and gender, even as changes in specific quality of life dimensions varied. Our results demonstrate that well-designed transit interventions and participatory planning processes can make cities not only more climate friendly but also more equal.

AB  - New business, real estate and public investment dollars are skewed towards the predominantly white outlying suburbs, which fuels metropolitan sprawl, development of green spaces, and loss of farms. Many U.S. centre-cities are relegated to a preponderance of abandoned and potentially contaminated properties or brownfields. This unequal outward expansion is caused, in part, by unfair zoning and real estate practices that result in decreased development choices and increased social and economic inequality. Under-utilization of existing infrastructure potentially results in hundreds of billions of :dollars in inefficiencies due to added costs and under-utilized capital. Exclusionary zoning, often based on minimum lot size requirements per household or exclusions of multifamily or accessory housing units, results in non market limits to affordable housing. Unlike Europe's transit oriented developments, dispersed development in the U.S. increases automobile reliance and associated mobile source pollutants. Smart growth policies and brownfield redevelopment in the U.S. can help redress one-sided investment practices that have directed development and jobs away from older and poorer communities. However, market processes are distorted to under-price sprawling greenfield development, leading to sub-optimal land consumption and allocation of resources affecting the environment, community and regional economies, whilst exacerbating social-economic inequalities. More equitable urban redevelopment efforts can strengthen existing communities while promoting improved regional environmental performance along with fiscal and economic benefits.

AB  - As China rapidly urbanizes, the important task of maintaining a sustainable economy and social harmony will fall on the shoulders of cities. From megacities to townships, all face serious challenges from "urban disease." Chinese cities are the main consumers of resources, the key link for a low-carbon economy, and the main battlefield for pursuing justice and fairness in making environmental decisions. Livability should become an important benchmark for urban planning experts, real estate agents, and government officials. The task of measuring cities' livability urgently demands citizens' involvement, and a consideration of their perspectives. This paper attempts to discuss the relationship between livable cities and the current environmental challenges facing China, analyze livability indicators, and suggest that non-governmental environmental protection organizations should become involved in the discussion on building livable cities and pay greater attention to China's urban ecological footprint.

AB  - Municipal solid waste (MSW) requires adequate management to mitigate the negative impacts caused by its poor disposal in the environment. It is composed of several fractions, such as organic waste, paper, cardboard, metals, plastic, and glass, among other valuable materials. An area of opportunity for its recovery is the construction industry, which currently consumes around 3000 million tons of natural resources annually and is responsible for 34% of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. There are examples of the worldwide reuse of MSW in construction materials: plastics have been incorporated as substitutes for sand in the production of concrete and pavements; paper as a hygrothermal and lighting regulator in buildings; and glass has been reused as fine aggregate in concrete mixtures, among others. In this paper, we revised how these MSW fractions have been used for designing and producing sustainable construction materials, thereby favoring a circular economy approach and reducing their landfilling. Opportunity areas for these materials to be developed and applied were also identified focusing on Latin America and the Caribbean.

AB  - Electric vehicles (EVs) are considered a promising technology and an attractive solution for a low-carbon future. It is therefore necessary to model the market penetration of EVs and determine the role of EV adoption in future urban decarbonization scenarios. This study developed an integrated land use?transport?energy model to examine interactions between location choice, land use, transport patterns, energy profiles, and economy when implementing a stringent EV policy. Two scenarios were structured to investigate the long-term (to 2050) impacts of EV adoption on population distribution, land use patterns, transport demand, energy mix, emission profiles, and social welfare. Scenario simulations showed that ambitious market diffusion of EVs is likely to have significant positive effects on emission reduction in city centers, while economic benefits tend to occur in suburban areas, implying that EV adoption will play an important role in the spatial organization and structure of cities. The spatial heterogeneity of different urban zones requires more attention when evaluating the effectiveness of sustainable urban policies. Because disaggregated spatial interactions can be handled by the new integrated model, the methodology proposed here will be a useful tool for sustainable urban planning.

AB  - As an important sustainable development goal, the creation of low-carbon cities (LCCs) has become crucial to creating livable cities and environmental sustainability. Thus, we aimed to understand the factors that support the transition of traditional cities to LCCs, by analyzing and synthesizing how to promote practical LCC across 15 pilot municipalities in four regions of Thailand, covering four strategies: City of Trees, City of Waste Minimization, City of Energy Efficiency, and City of Sustainable Consumption. Literature research, in-depth interviews, and observations were employed for data collection, while the 5 W (who, says what, in which channel, to whom, and with what effect) and SMCR (sender, message, channel, and receiver) models were used to create a communication analysis framework. Results revealed that the effective activities of municipalities should increase tree planting and implement more serious regulations for the conservation of existing trees. Making compost and establishing waste recycling banks are recommended for rural municipalities, while optimization of garbage and wastewater management systems and facilities should be highlighted in urban municipalities. Moreover, recycling, low-carbon agriculture, second-hand shops/markets, green markets, and homegrown vegetables should be encouraged for sustainable consumption. Working with local municipalities, credible leaders and representatives were the key senders. Additionally, message design should compare the pros and cons of behaviors, connect with local health and tourism, and promote dialogue in easy-to-understand and thought-provoking language. Receivers that drive LCC should have an excellent understanding of LCC practice and its benefits, be public-minded, and have a desire to live in a good environment.

AB  - Social housing providers have a significant amount of influence over large housing stocks, which gives them unique opportunities to address both energy efficiency and social inclusion. However, there are significant barriers to achieving these goals in southern European contexts, where obsolete housing stocks and widespread energy poverty situations combine to create a "prebound effect", whereby residents consume less energy than in projections of standardised patterns, thus invalidating models based on energy efficiency gains and energy production. This paper uses empirical findings from interviews with social housing providers in the metropolitan areas of Porto [Portugal] and Barcelona [Spain] to understand how this contradiction is being handled in the sector, and compares the findings with surveys of the nature and depth of energy poverty situations in a broadly defined social housing sector. Our results show that social housing providers tend to favour strategies based on retrofitting the envelopes of the buildings, and to resist installing renewable energy equipment, for which cost recoupment is near-unachievable. We argue that this focus on achieving thermal comfort by passive measures overlooks the multidimensionality of energy poverty situations in the social housing sector, with widespread practices of restrictions on cooking, lighting and DHW uses.

AB  - In recent decades, many cities have launched low-carbon pilot schemes to explore feasible local policies and actions that can be replicated on a larger scale to reduce the intensity of carbon emissions. This synthesis analysis reviews the global literature to analyse the interplay of prescriptive visions, practical responses, and evaluation methods of low-carbon urban experiments. Before 2015, low-carbon urban experiments were regarded as a sub-branch of sustainable development, and prescriptive visions were influenced by sustainability. Low-carbon urban experiments were used as an urban planning tool, and such urban planning concepts impacted the practical response and evaluation methods. After 2015, low-carbon urban experiments were influenced by many more disciplines. Planning still occupies the largest proportion of low-carbon practices, but more advanced technologies - in energy and other fields - have also been adopted and influence the evolution of low-carbon urban experiments. We find several driving factors, including political events and developments, technology change, and contributions from various disciplines including academic research. As carbon neutrality is the long-term target of many nations, achieving net-zero carbon dioxide emissions through prescriptive visions, practical responses, and evaluation methods in urban experiments demands further investigation, especially in developing countries.Key policy insightsLow-carbon initiatives on a small scale are frequently practiced by local and national governments, which has reshaped the low-carbon agenda worldwide.Low-carbon development also demands efforts and commitment on the part of local urban governments to promote low-carbon development in its multiple dimensions.Policymakers at different levels of government and governance should focus on how to build on policy instruments in experimental pilots to take action at broader scales.Policymakers also need to adopt relevant indicators from social science in evaluation methods to reflect social sustainability and inclusiveness concerns in the evaluation of low-carbon urban development.

AB  - Climate-adaptive energy resilience and low-carbon transformation are mainstreams to combat with climate change uncertainty, rural energy poverty, and urban modern energy systems. However, effective strategies have not been provided for energy resilience enhancement considering centralized and decentralized system transition, climate change, extreme weather, natural disasters, equipment failure. In this study, urban and rural energy systems are comprehensively reviewed and compared for low-carbon and sustainability transformation, in terms of energy structures, raw energy sources availability, energy consumption density and carbon emission, accessibility on renewable energy, and etc. Advanced modelling techniques were systematically reviewed for integrated multi-energy systems. Decarbonisation pathways on both urban and rural energy systems were explored. Last but not the least, energy resilience on urban and rural energy systems was studied, including climate change database and modelling techniques, climate change on energy demands and power supply in district energy systems, energy planning strategies for energy resilience enhancement. Research results indicate that, rural areas are abundant in bioenergy (like biogas, biomass, etc), sufficient for renewable system installations, but limited access to modern energy services and energy poverty, while urban cities are characterized with limited spaces for renewable systems, unbalanced cooling/heating loads, and a large amount of waste. Modelling techniques for integrated multi-energy systems mainly include physical models, human knowledge-based machine learning models and data-driven models. The physical models and human knowledge-based machine learning models require specific expertise in physical mechanisms, while the data-driven models are superior in calculation efficiency and user-friendly interface. Energy resilience on urban and rural energy systems is able to ensure a reliable energy supply, and emergency plan to address disruptions from events, like extreme weather and natural disasters. To achieve climate-adaptive energy resilience and low-carbon transformation, main challenges include socio-economic equality access, deployment of charging piles and smart charging development for electric vehicles, battery circular economy in integrated rural-city energy systems, and carbon intensity of battery circular economy. Research results can promote climate-adaptive energy resilience and low-carbon urban modern energy and rural energy poverty systems in China.

AB  - As cities consider how to provide essential urban services in the post-fossil fuel age, they find that incremental strategies are not enough. The challenge, and opportunity, is to reinvent essential city infrastructure-for water, food, shelter, energy, transport, culture, and economy-in a climate-friendly way. By reclaiming human-scale neighborhoods, relearning and further developing sustainable and passive building techniques, and reaching forward with technology in the service of society, cities can thrive with less energy and fewer greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This chapter examines essential concepts and examples of low-carbon urban infrastructure, highlighting urban form designed in harmony with the city's geography; resilience to climate change impacts as well as reductions in greenhouse gas emissions; and prioritization of demand-side management in city systems, through improved design, efficiency, and de-carbonization.

AB  - Adaptive reuse of existing buildings and shared spaces has been highlighted as a key circular economy concept in the built environment, with the former also having been found to increase social sustainability through the preservation of cultural heritage. However, circular economy research has focused on the economic and environmental dimensions, with the social dimension receiving less attention. The aim of this study is, therefore, to establish the social impact of an adaptive reuse case with shared spaces. A supplementary aim is to test and adapt the general social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) framework to fit the built environment context. A qualitative single case study method is used. The study finds significant positive social impacts from the adaptive reuse case, mainly in the form of economic and cultural impact on the local community. The S-LCA framework was a useful tool in assessing the social impact of the case. Additional indicators of particular relevance to the built environment are identified relating to the end-users and local community, as well as indicators relating to society, value chain actors, and workers.Practice relevanceA set of sector-specific indicators is created to capture the social impact. The findings are useful for researchers and industry professionals intending to evaluate and increase the social sustainability of a construction or demolition project. The improved S-LCA framework and set of indicators allows for an improved understanding of built environment implications. Planners, designers, and clients can employ the revised framework to evaluate projects pre- and post-construction or demolition.

AB  - Population is the main driver of land-system and environmental change. However, population is usually treated as a variable that only considers the population number, and multi-dimensional population structure is largely ignored. There has been a systematic transition of population structure in the past several decades, including changes in household structure, increasing aging populations, increasing divorce rates, and increasing human migration. All of these changes have direct or indirect impacts on land use and environmental issues. Here, taking China as an example and using statistical analysis, namely the Mann–Kendall trend test and a land-use-transition matrix, we examine the relationship between household dynamics and land-use change in China by examining changes in household structure and land-use changes in China between 1980 and 2020. The results show the following three groups of findings. (1) The number of households increased by 130.95% from 1980 to 2020, while the population only increased by 42.83%; the size of households decreased from 4.41 to 2.62 in China from 1982 to 2020; and the household dynamics varied from province to province, which is affected by urbanization rate and economic development. (2) Birth rates, divorce rates, population aging, and migration all affect household structure, which directly or indirectly affect changes in land-use systems. (3) The changes in China’s land use are interlinked and interact with changes in household structure, which is evident in the increase in Residential land use and the abandonment of arable land. The rising household number increased the area of urban and rural settlement, leading to the fragmentation of cultivated land and the reduction of ecological land. To regulate land-use change for sustainable development, future land-use planning should take into account the effect of household dynamics and should reduce the negative effects of household dynamics on land systems and environmental change.

AB  - As urban spaces expand, changes in land use significantly affect the structure and function of urban ecosystems, particularly with challenges such as green space reduction and uneven distribution. This study focused on the central urban area of Chengdu, China, simulating and forecasting various urban development scenarios for 2035, including cultivated land protection (CP), economic development (ED), ecological priority (EP), and natural development (ND). The construction of green space ecological networks followed a systematic process, incorporating key methods such as ecological source identification, landscape resistance surface construction, and ecological corridor extraction. The connectivity of these ecological networks was assessed using the space syntax. The results indicated that: (1) Construction land expanded across all scenarios, with the ED scenario having the largest area, while the EP scenario resulted in a significant increase in green space. (2) Ecological corridors were established under every scenario, with the EP scenario featuring the most extensive and well-connected network, linking urban green patches with surrounding natural areas. (3) The EP scenario’s ecological network displayed integration, choice, connectivity, and depth values that indicate the most complete and stable network structure. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of green space ecological network changes under different urban development strategies, offering valuable insights for optimizing urban green space planning and management.

AB  - The UN’s 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call for the provision of universal access to: (a) safe, inclusive, and accessible green and public spaces, and (b) safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable transport systems for all. The Barcelona green axes plan aims to transform one third of the streets within its 19th century extension grid, increasing the tree cover and the vegetation, adopting sustainable urban drainage systems, limiting motor traffic, and providing a safer and more comfortable environment for pedestrians, cyclists, and other social activities in healthier environments. These transformations become even greater at the intersection of the axes, where former traffic junctions are becoming squares and urban gardens. This study gives an in-depth analysis of the origins of the superblocks plan, the rationale behind the transformation, and the implementation process. The GIS-based analysis shows how the green axes and the new square gardens (a) transform the city’s disconnected urban green areas into a more interconnected green infrastructure system, and (b) significantly increase accessibility to green areas. The study reveals this strategy’s potential to create a city of proximity, improve the well-being of the population, and build a more equitable city, which could be a useful tool for planning and decision making at both city and regional levels.

AB  - In the aftermath of the global pandemic, the widespread embrace of flexible working models has led to suboptimal occupancy levels in office buildings. Despite this shift, traditional space management practices persist, contributing to increased energy consumption per person. This study investigates how integrating smart lock systems can enhance space utilization within flexible working environments, ultimately reducing energy use. A case study of an office building in Milan, Italy, is used to evaluate the proposed approach. The methodology includes a comprehensive assessment of building design and functionality, coupled with impact analyses using Building Energy Modeling and Life Cycle Assessment. The results indicate that innovative occupancy management strategies can achieve energy savings of from 9% up to 14% compared to baseline operational energy use, leading to a reduction in CO2 emissions of 7.5 to 17.6 kgCO2eq/m2 depending on occupancy scenarios. The life cycle assessment reveals that, while smart locks introduce an initial embodied carbon footprint of approximately 2 tons of CO2, that is recovered through the savings obtained after a few months of installation. The findings demonstrate that this methodology is effective in buildings that allow both functional and temporal flexibility, enabling partial shutdowns and the redirection of certain services when not in use, ultimately improving energy efficiency through lean interventions.

AB  - The present research aims to propose the design of a green corridor with a systemic/sustainable approach to function as an ecological lung for the city of Cuzco. A lack of planning has resulted in uncontrolled urban development, with a shortage of green areas, negatively affecting the quality of life. Green corridors stand out as solutions that encourage social interaction and improve public health. This approach recognizes the need for balanced resource management and institutional, economic and social organization. In the specific case of Cusco, the lack of social interaction highlights the importance of addressing these challenges to improve the quality of life for both residents and visitors. The methods developed were an extensive literature review, urban analysis and climate analysis, applying sustainability strategies supported by digital tools (Google Earth, Climate Consultant 6.0, Autocad, SketchUp and 3d Sun Path). As a result, this proposal presents green areas covering 69.96% of the total area, aimed at providing recreational spaces and connecting residents and visitors with nature. Additionally, biolakes were designed, accounting for 3.18% of the area, serving as ornamental elements and contributing to the environmental quality of the urban environment. The botanical zone, encompassing 18.14% of the project, was designed to accommodate a diverse range of plant species, providing an educational and aesthetic environment. The convention area, representing 9.7% of the total area, was designed to host events and community activities, promoting social and cultural interaction. Finally, 0.98% of the space was allocated to the cultural zone, where artistic exhibitions, cultural events, and related activities can be planned, enriching the cultural and social life of the community. These percentages reflect careful consideration of the needs and aspirations of the population, as well as a comprehensive approach to sustainable urban design and the creation of multifunctional spaces. In conclusion, through a green corridor, the aim is to counteract uncontrolled urban expansion and environmental degradation by generating a green lung in the city of Cuzco, naturally regulating the climate and contributing to air and water purification. The absence of green corridors and sustainable approaches to social connectivity in Cusco could reduce the quality of life of residents, affecting their physical and mental health. The lack of green and recreational spaces could increase segregation and alienation in the community, weakening social cohesion. Without green corridors, the city would also face environmental and biodiversity challenges, as well as a reduced ability to respond to extreme weather events. The lack of implementation of these strategies could compromise comprehensive development and quality of life in Cuzco.

AB  - Sustainable insulation is an integral part of energy efficient building design. Buildings have a significant carbon and energy footprint and using sustainable material is key to their decarbonization especially in cladding. In additional traditional cladding materials are not environmentally friendly. In developing countries with constrained construction budgets, limited resources and existing energy poverty using local resources is important to sustainable development, reducing building energy demand and supporting the local circular economy. Hence the aim of this research is to assess the thermal insulation and mechanical properties to identify an optimal mix of clay, cork, and sheep wool in composite bricks to improve energy efficiency in buildings. The novelty is that wool was introduced into the composite via an innovative method in the form of yarn network layers. The obtained results revealed that the thermomechanically optimal composite, which is clay specimen incorporating 12 % of the cork mass percentage with 2 % of wool in one layer (ClW2Co12) provides a gain of 64 % in thermal conductivity, 49 % in thermal effusivity, and 50 % in thermal diffusivity. Furthermore, the specimen ClW2Co12 is 14 % higher in flexural and 24 % lower in compressive strength compared to the reference material (clay alone) at the 30-day setting period. This innovative method ameliorates the lightness of the elaborated ClW2Co12 brick by about 52 %. These findings indicate that the developed composite made with locally available and economically local sustainable materials can be well used as thermal insulator in buildings using a circular economy approach.

AB  - Pluvial floods can exert significant pressure on urban sustainability and human wellbeing during rapid urbanization. Rapid urbanization and exacerbated flooding have stimulated investigations of green land's role in mitigating urban flooding in China. The newly applied "Sponge City" plan considers the concave green land (CGL) as an effective tool in mitigating pluvial floods. However, its capacity and beneficiaries still need to be elucidated. This paper fills this research gap by integrating urban flood simulation, scenario analysis, and mitigation assessment in central Shanghai, China. It reveals that CGL could not only mitigate direct runoff and inundation, but also reduce population exposure and enhance community resilience. CGL with a depth of 0.10-0.20 m can mitigate direct runoffs by 23.63-98.35% and inundation extents by 26.09-82.41%, resulting in a slide of the exposed urban population by 0.40-1.04 million persons and the exposed elders by 0.04-0.12 million persons. Moreover, the effectiveness of CGL varies spatially implying for a sound spatial planning of CGLs and a potential combination with other flood mitigation measures. These findings could help cities particularly in developing countries to adapt to rising pluvial flooding through urban planning and nature-based flood mitigation measures.

AB  - Urban sprawl, a consequence of urban growth, profoundly impacts land use/land cover, particularly in regions like the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, as this Biome hosts most of the Brazilian population and is recognized as a global biodiversity hotspot. This study uses geospatial techniques, the Cellular Automata model, and structural landscape metrics to simulate future urban land use changes for 2050. The simulation suggests a significant increase in urban areas by 2050, changing from 32.1% in 2020 to nearly 43% by 2050, mainly encroaching upon agricultural lands. Conversely, forest fragments are projected to decline (lost 3% of areas), and the connectivity analysis highlighted the loss along the rivers, emphasizing the need for proactive conservation strategies. Preserving periurban agriculture is vital for food security and sustainable development, while innovative management of riparian ecosystems enhances urban biodiversity and citizen well-being. Sustainable urban planning and conservation efforts are imperative to mitigate the adverse effects of urban sprawl and foster resilient cities. This research provides crucial insights for decision-makers aiming to balance urban development with environmental preservation in the face of rapid urbanization.

AB  - Cultural heritage can play a strategic role in developing a sustainable built environment, contributing to the improvement of the economic, social, and environmental productivity of a city. Human activities are constantly affecting the quality of the environment and altering the ecosystems, which produce negative consequences also on human wellbeing. Within this context, it has been much discussed how cities and the built environment can counteract this process by supporting more sustainable development. Adaptive reuse is defined as “a process that changes a disused or ineffective item into a new item that can be used for a different purpose”, which strongly triggers the sustainable development of cities. It can be recognized as a promoter of economic growth, social wellbeing, and environmental preservation, given its capability of both preserving past values and creating new ones. The adaptive reuse matches the main points of the circular economy, seen as the sustainable economy, which is aimed at the reduction of natural resource extraction and environmental impact by extending the useful life of materials and promoting recovery, reuse, and regeneration processes. Given these premises, the current contribution aimed to evaluate alternative scenarios for reuse in Castello Visconteo in Cusago, located in the Lombardy region (Italy), and understanding how adaptive reuse could contribute to generating new values within a circular economy perspective. In detail, four alternative scenarios were proposed to face the new needs born during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Since both intangible and tangible values must be considered, a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) has been applied by combining economic and qualitative indicators to define the most suitable function for its adaptive reuse. In detail, the Novel Approach to Imprecise Assessment and Decision Environments (NAIADE) was used to identify the best alternative solution based on the opinions of conflicting stakeholders. The innovativeness of the contribution is given by the combination of different methodologies, the preservation of the memory and the generation of new values, and the consideration of adaptive reuse as a strategy for the achievement of sustainable development within a circular economy perspective.

AB  - Construction activities in inner cities are major prerequisites of the Clinton Administration's Enterprise and Empowerment Zones Policies. Municipal authorities should make sure that the unemployed and indigenous small contractors benefit as much as possible from the construction required to make these policies successful. Construction activities geared towards the repair of municipal infrastructure, environmental degradation, and housing have the additional benefits of providing positive externalities, particularly as these affect the quality of life. To assist in poverty alleviation, contractor development should be emphasized and the mechanisms of the market fully utilized to encourage these contractors to optimize labor use on their projects.

AB  - There is growing interest in energy sufficiency (ES); however, it remains conceptually debated and contested. This study presents a novel approach to measuring ES using unique microdata on the energy consumption of Japanese households. This approach determines lower and upper thresholds regarding domestic energy consumption for each household type and then identifies whether people really meet an adequate level of domestic energy services, with their diverse energy needs considered. The result illustrates that most people in Japan live in ES, despite about one-tenth being in energy poverty (EP) and one-twentieth in energy extravagance (EE). In addition, this study empirically clarifies the characteristics of people in ES, as well as those in EP and EE. People in ES and EE generally belong to higher income groups, live in larger houses, and are less committed to energysaving behaviours; the opposite applies to people in EP. As a policy implication, this study suggests more progressive energy tariffs and carbon pricing, as well as improvement in access to renewable energy for the EP population, to engender an inclusive low-carbon energy transition and allow everyone to achieve ES.

AB  - Our societies struggle to provide a good life for all without overconsuming environmental resources. Consequently, scholarly search for approaches to meet environmental and social goals of sustainability have become popular. In transport research, accessibility is a key tool to characterise linkages between people, transport, and land use. In the current paper, we propose a conceptual framework for measuring just accessibility within planetary boundaries. We reviewed transport studies and discovered a substantial literature body on accessibility and social disadvantage, much vaster compared to the literature around environmental and ecological impacts of accessibility. We also show a gap in approaches that have integrated these two perspectives. Building on the review, we suggest a conceptual framework for incorporating environmental and social sustainability goals in accessibility research. We conclude the paper by pointing to key challenges and research avenues related to the framework, including (i) dealing with uncertainty and complexity in socio-ecological thresholds, (ii) integrating environmental limits into the conceptualisations of transport equity, (iii) measuring accessibility through other costs than travel time, and (iv) integrating both quantitative and qualitative data.

AB  - This study aims to systematize indicators and indices that allow measurement sustainable development in cities and towns (economic, social, and environmental). It is one dimension that is inseparable from current cities and its extent is a major concern for political decision-makers worldwide, and also present their individual weights in that performance. The results allow construction of a Composite Index for Sustainability supported by multivariate statistical techniques (Exploratory Factor Analysis and Principal Component Analysis), confirming its scientific quality and robustness, and forming the main contribution of this study. The results also show that the urban sustainability dimension is visible in the 308 Portuguese cities/towns in a tri-partite way. Economic sustainability (weighting of 0.386) has been strengthened by entrepreneurship, which has created new business supported by public-private partnerships, such as living labs, which has contributed to less urban unemployment. Standing out in social sustainability (weighting of 0.245) is the development of projects promoting cohesion and social inclusion and actions to improve social infrastructure in Portuguese towns. Finally, environmental sustainability (weighting of 0.369), which locally in Portugal, has emphasized waste management and actions to preserve and protect natural resources and the environment in general. However, more effective actions are needed for their sustainability to continue to improve substantially in the long term, for example, environmentally. Furthermore, the towns/cities analysed must change to the circular economy model as proposed by the European Union.

AB  - Innovative and sustainable energy technologies are needed in the transition of energy toward a circular economy. Because of the use of renewable energy and carbon utilization, power-to-gas could be a cutting-edge technology that supports the circular model in future sustainable energy markets. However, this technology faces new technical and socio-economic challenges. The use of power-to-gas is limited because of barriers that limit the mobilization of investment capital. In addition, social and economic impacts on the territories in which these facilities are located are under study. In this context, the aims of this paper are: (i) To explore the determinants and barriers for power-to-gas technology to enhance the understanding of investment in innovative energy technologies; and (ii) to support effective policymaking and energy companies' decision-making processes. This study defines and measures, from a circular economy perspective, the main impacts of the deployment of this technology on a territory in terms of volume of investment, employment generation, and CO2 capture. The study also provides a simplified methodology to contribute to the analysis of the use of power-to-gas. Finally, it improves the knowledge of the socio-economic impact of this cutting-edge technology for the transition of energy to a zero-emission scenario.

AB  - In an urbanized world, the challenges posed by climate change need to be met through innovative planning for cities and regions. Urban resilience demands that cities adopt new models centered on carbon neutrality, ecosystem services and biodiversity enhancement, circularity, and social inclusion. In light of the multiple interdependencies of metropolitan systems and the natural and territorial potentialities present on their fringes, this paper discusses the metropolitan fringes as strategic for urban resilience and sustainable transitions. By combining a mixed-method analysis of adaptation and urban plans with semi-structured interviews performed with key technicians, the analysis is focused on an inter-municipal fringe zone within the Barcelona Metropolitan Area - the Bes`os territory. Aiming to contribute to the discussions related to Territorial innovation for cities and regions, the paper offers a multi-scale perspective and illustrates innovative urban transformation strategies across scales. The results highlight that governance and multiple planning and participation instances together with technical and financial support are essential for consensus building in an incremental process. Furthermore, the planning strategies of the case study sought to integrate and enhance the green and blue infrastructures and transform consolidated urban areas with a focus on energy transition, sustainable mobility, circularity, and social inclusion. In conclusion, it is argued that resilience has a multi-scalar perspective within the metropolitan context and should be integrated with planning policies at different scales from a coordinated vision. Although adaptation and urban projects have a critical local element, a broader and more strategic vision is necessary, especially in metropolitan fringe areas.

AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this study is to understand the social impacts on various stakeholders — consumers, workers, value chain actors, local community, and society — who are directly or indirectly impacted by the construction of land transportation infrastructure. The study further extends to determine the scale of change in these social impacts with the incorporation of circular economy (CE) in the sector.MethodsThe study is based on the UNEP-SETAC methodology for social life cycle assessment (S-LCA). Separate questionnaires are designed for each of the stakeholder categories — ensuring assessment for every social impact category. Social impact scores (SICs) are determined for every social impact category for the existing business-as-usual (BaU) scenario for every stakeholder category. Furthermore, to determine the change in social impacts in a circular economy scenario, experts are interviewed to understand and account for the change. The change in social impacts is mapped using a “Potential Circular Impact” formula devised by the authors. Finally, the results are compared based on the scale of social impacts in the BaU and CE scenarios.ResultsIt is observed that in the BaU scenario, the value chain actors have the highest social scores, implying that value chain actors fare well in the selected social impact categories. Furthermore, the consumers have the least social well-being, followed by the local community. In the case of a transition to CE, it is observed that the highest social benefits will be available for consumers, whereas the workers will be least benefited. The results also present the scale of change with the adoption of circular economy with respect to every social impact category, as well as corresponding performance indicators.ConclusionThe study presents a general trend of the potential social trade-offs of implementation of CE in the construction sector. The results can aid construction management and policy makers to design and implement strategies for the welfare of various stakeholders. The research is also of value for accounting social impacts of transitioning to CE.

AB  - Land use regulations have played a critical role in the siting and operation of renewable energy technologies. While there is a growing literature on the siting of wind and solar technologies, less is known about the relationship between local codes and planning decisions and the development of wood-based bioenergy technologies, particularly in rural places. This research examines the relationship between local land use policies and the siting and operation of different types of wood-based bioenergy technologies in northern Michigan, USA. Land use codes including zoning laws and ordinances related to wood-burning devices from 506 cities, townships, and villages within 36 counties in northern Michigan were combined with US Census data in a GIS database. ArcGIS was used to examine geographical differences between communities and socioeconomic factors related to different regulatory approaches. We found that areas with greater population densities and higher income and education levels tended to have more nuanced land use codes related to all scales of wood-burning, including residential wood heating, commercial-scale heating, and power generation. This paper emphasizes the importance of local decision-making and land use policies in shaping the development of wood-based energy technologies, and suggests the need for greater attention to rural community dynamics in planning the shift to a lower-carbon economy.

AB  - Due to an alarming rate on the impact of global climate change, the integration of low-carbon goal in regeneration of historic urban areas is regarded as a key part towards the implementation of sustainable urbanism practises based on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). Much studies on the planning and design of low carbon strategies concerned overwhelmingly on the new planned cities without much emphasis given on the implemented at old town centre. In the context of Malay early town, the adaptation of the low carbon planning as shifting in environmental conditions is regarded as paramount importance particularly in the planning of the urban form to address the growing complexity of urban fabric at the town. This paper therefore explores the developed framework of Low Carbon City initiative and integration of resilience as an approach in urban transformation and regeneration of Malay early town to provide the platform for understanding the complexity of urban-natural environment from morphological perspective. The purpose of this research is two-fold; firstly, to examine the role of discourse in implementing Low Carbon City Framework (LCCF) in Malaysia at large. The second objective is to identify the place-specific mechanisms based on resilience approach to understand the capacity of urban form system to absorb, adapt or transform in ensuring the dynamic equilibrium of the urban-natural system. Considering Kota Bharu as representative of Malay town, a discursive-analytical perspective framed to examine the upsurge of the LCCF that helps to understand the pathway towards integration of framework at national, state and district level. Such comprehension on implementation measure formed a basis to identify the interactions between environmental performance and urban forms pattern as strategies for resilience. A case study with mapping analysis were employed that revealed significant relations between socio-cultural and environmental dimension which shaped the formation and transformation of urban morphology of the town. This study concludes with an examination of possible future directions for integration of space-morphological approach to general urban resilience for future adaptation planning of Malay towns towards Low Carbon City.

AB  - The overall objective of this study was to investigate urban infill development policies as a good solution to counteract urban sprawl and protect the peri-urban area of Ardabil in Northwestern Iran. In this context, we used a mixed methodology (two quantitative methods). Landsat imagery, including a patchy Landsat ETM+ for the year 2000 and a Landsat 8 for the year 2020, was used to map and assess land use to investigate sprawl and land-use change, and ArcGIS was used to investigate the potential for infill development in this city. The results show that between 2000 and 2020, 967 hectares of peri-urban land was lost to urban expansion. CA-Markov projections also showed that 452 hectares will be lost by 2030. The assessment of the city’s internal capacity for infill development showed that more than 999 hectares of land within the city are suitable to support this strategy and provide the land needed for urban expansion over the next decade. Finally, the study of the city’s master plan, which applies to all Iranian cities, discovered that there is a lack of adequate outlook regarding the amount of land available for future urban development, leading to misuse of urban land and urban sprawl in Iranian cities, suggesting that an infill development strategy could be a good way to address this issue.

AB  - This study proposes a methodology and a proof of concept to target and prioritize mass retrofitting of residential buildings in the UK using open building datasets that combine fabric energy efficiency and fuel poverty to meet the net-zero targets. The methodological framework uses a series of multi-variate statistical and geospatial methods that consider urban, socio-economic and physical attributes. In addition, thermal imaging is implemented to provide insights at the building scale. We define a hard-to-decarbonize (HtD) metric to enable the clustering of different residential types to establish retrofitting priorities. Using Cambridge, UK, as a case study, five neighbourhoods were identified and characterized to help determine decarbonization intervention priorities. We found that one of five clusters of neighbourhoods is HtD and requires more policy support from government for the implementation of retrofit strategies. The achieved framework has the potential to inform policy and decision making. Of relevance, it is applicable to different urban contexts.

AB  - As the world continues to urbanize, identifying and implementing new urban development models and strategies is necessary to face sustainable development challenges. To this end, the circular economy model can be implemented in cities in order to operationalize and achieve human sustainable development managing simultaneously, in a systemic perspective, the social inequalities issue and the ecological and economic crisis. Today there are many cities that are defining themselves as a "circular city" but, to date, a clear definition of this does not exist. In the transition towards the circular city, tools (such as evaluation, governance, financial, business tools) play a fundamental role. The aim of this paper is (after an analysis of the concept of the circular city and its implementation, starting from literature, official documents and reports) to identify and analyze tools for implementing the circular city model. In particular, a set of indicators to assess (positive and/or negative) impacts of projects and initiatives of the circular city agenda is identified.

AB  - Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is undergoing rapid urbanization, yet research comparing urban expansion and agricultural land loss in peri-urban areas is scarce. This study utilizes multi-temporal Landsat imagery to examine the impact of urban growth on agricultural land and fragile ecosystems in Kampala (a mega city) and Mbarara (a regional urban center) in Uganda. We distinguish between random and systematic land-use and land-cover (LULC) transitions in the landscape. The results reveal substantial urban expansion. Kampala’s urban area surged from 7.14% in 1989 to 55.10% in 2015, while Mbarara increased from 6.37% in 2002 to 30.95% in 2016. Correspondingly, agricultural land decreased, from 48.02% to 16.69% in Kampala, and from 39.92% to 32.08% in Mbarara. Notably, a significant proportion of urban growth in both cities encroached upon agricultural land (66.7% in Kampala and 57.8% in Mbarara). The transition from agricultural to built-up areas accounted for 14.72% to 28.45% of the landscapes. Additionally, unsustainable practices led to the conversion of wetlands and forests to agricultural land, with approximately 13% of wetlands and 23% of Savannah and forests being converted between 2001 and 2015. These findings underscore the necessity of monitoring LULC changes for sustainable urban growth management, emphasizing the importance of preserving agricultural land and ecosystems to ensure present and future food security. This research contributes to the understanding of urbanization’s impact on peri-urban agricultural land and ecosystems in SSA, providing insights that are crucial for informed urban planning and policy formulation aimed at sustainable development in the region.

AB  - Examining the interconnected dynamics of urbanization and climate change is crucial due to their implications for environmental, social, and public health systems. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of these dynamics in the Peshawar Valley, a rapidly urbanizing region in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, over a 30-year period (1990–2020). A novel methodological framework integrating remote sensing, GIS techniques, and Google Earth Engine (GEE) was developed to analyze land use/land cover (LULC) changes, particularly the expansion of the built-up environment, along with the land surface temperature (LST) and heat index (HI). This framework intricately links these elements, providing a unique perspective on the environmental transformations occurring in the Peshawar Valley. Unlike previous studies that focused on individual aspects, this research offers a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between urbanization, land use changes, temperature dynamics, and heat index variations. Over three decades, urbanization expanded significantly, with built-up areas increasing from 6.35% to 14.13%. The population surged from 5.3 million to 12.6 million, coupled with significant increases in registered vehicles (from 0.171 million to 1.364 million) and operational industries (from 327 to 1155). These transitions influenced air quality and temperature dynamics, as evidenced by a highest mean LST of 30.30 °C and a maximum HI of 55.48 °C, marking a notable increase from 50.54 °C. These changes show strong positive correlations with built-up areas, population size, registered vehicles, and industrial activity. The findings highlight the urgent need for adaptive strategies, public health interventions, and sustainable practices to mitigate the environmental impacts of urbanization and climate change in the Peshawar Valley. Sustainable urban development strategies and climate change mitigation measures are crucial for ensuring a livable and resilient future for the region. This long-term analysis provides a robust foundation for future projections and policy recommendations.

AB  - Municipal solid waste and cement manufacture are two sources of environmental justice issues in urban and suburban areas. Waste utilization is an attractive alternative to disposal for eliminating environmental injustice, reducing potential hazards, and improving urban sustainability. The re-use and recycling of municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) ash in the construction industry has drawn significant attention. Incorporating MSWI ash in cement and concrete production is a potential path that mitigates the environmental justice issues in waste management and the construction industry. This paper presents a critical overview of the pretreatment methods that optimize MSWI ash utilization in cement/concrete and the influences of MSWI ash on the performance of cement/concrete. This review aims to elucidate the potential advantages and limitations associated with the use of MSWI ash for producing cement clinker, alternative binder (e.g., alkali-activated material), cement substitutes, and aggregates. A brief overview of the generation and characteristics of MSWI ash is reported, accompanied by identifying opportunities for the use of MSWI ash-incorporated products in industrial-scale applications and recognizing associated environmental justice implications.

AB  - Smart cities aim to adapt the living conditions in the best way by using human and technology factors, which are among their basic components. At this point, the components of smart cities show some changes according to the economic, social and cultural values of the countries, and the investments made in these components reveal new city versions. Improving sustainable design thinking and social innovation requires collaborative studies via policy-making process and related applications. Local governments, designers and stakeholders need to focus on how to create a new way of thinking for smart and sustainable solutions for cities. This study presents an environmentally sensitive design proposal that uses smart energy technologies for integrating renewable energy alternatives into smart lighting system for promoting circular economy and increasing sustainability in public areas. Using renewable energy technologies not only adds value to the identity of these cities but also increases public awareness among users. For this purpose, a smart lighting design that generates electrical energy with kinetic flooring is designed and presented for usage in Çorlu Cumhuriyet Park. Çorlu has a strategic location and investment targets. It also has a high potential to become a smart city that can stand out on smart energy in Turkey, which is supported by the Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy Agreement signed in 2019. The designed smart lighting aims to integrate renewable energy into city furniture and increase environmental awareness by presenting citizens’ instant contribution to the renewable energy production in their daily activity.

AB  - The concept of nature-based solutions (NBS) emerges as a multidimensional approach to achieve sustainable development while enhancing resilience to environmental hazards, in solving the challenges posed by climate change and rapid urbanization. This article examines the integration of NBS in the development of the new capital city of Indonesia, located in Nusantara, East Kalimantan, focusing on its role in climate resilience and low carbon development. Methodologically, the study explores how NBS can effectively conserve green and blue carbon through a synthesis of literature, case studies, and policy analyses, thereby contributing to carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation efforts. Additionally, the paper examines the potential of NBS in reducing the impacts of hydrometeorological disasters, such as floods and forest fires, which pose significant threats to the region’s ecological integrity and human well-being. By leveraging the natural landscape and ecosystem services, NBS can mitigate urban heat island effects, improve air and water quality, enhance biodiversity, and reduce vulnerability to extreme weather events. Furthermore, the paper emphasizes the importance of stakeholder engagement, including the participation of Masyarakat adat (indigenous communities), in the co-design and implementation of NBS initiatives. Through inclusive governance structures and participatory planning processes, the new capital city can foster social cohesion, equity, and cultural resilience while advancing sustainable urban development goals. Overall, the integration of NBS represents a transformative pathway towards building climate-resilient and livable urban landscapes that serve as models of sustainability for Indonesia and beyond.

AB  - Dynamic development of tourism activities and rapid urbanisation in Special Economic Zones (SEZs) can lead to significant land use and land cover changes (LULCCs) and environmental degradation, particularly in ecologically sensitive areas. This study examines the transformation of land use and its associated impacts on habitat quality and thermal environment in Phu Quoc Island (Vietnam) over a 20-year period (2003–2023). Using multi-temporal Landsat satellite imagery and random forest classification, we quantify LULCCs and assess the environmental consequences of urban expansion on habitat degradation and intensification of the island’s thermal environment, focusing on land surface temperature (LST) changes. Our analysis reveals that rapid urbanisation, driven by large-scale tourism and infrastructure developments, has led to a significant loss of forest and farmland, leading to a 5.6% decline in habitat quality and a marked increase in LST. The study also highlights the uneven distribution of urban growth, with the majority of expansion occurring in the southern and central regions of the island. By applying the InVEST Habitat Quality Model, we identify key zones of habitat degradation and offer insights into the spatial patterns of environmental sensitivity and changes. Our findings underscore the need for integrated land use planning and sustainable development strategies to mitigate the negative environmental impacts of SEZ-driven urbanisation on island ecosystems. This research provides critical guidance for policymakers, planners, and environmental managers to balance economic growth with environmental conservation in fragile island environments.

AB  - Investigating the historical patterns of urban growth and their drivers is crucial to informing sustainable urban planning policies, especially in cities of the Global South. In Vietnam, most studies focus primarily on city extents, offering little insight into urban growth across various provinces. This study, therefore, combined categorical land use and land cover change detection, Random Forest classification and expert interviews to quantify the urban growth between 2000 and 2020, assess urban encroachment upon other land uses, and identify key drivers shaping this growth in Thua Thien Hue province. Findings show that the urban land areas were 27.94 km2, 82.97 km2, and 209.80 km2 in 2000, 2010, and 2020, respectively. Urban encroachment upon other land use types, especially cropland, barren land, rice paddies, shrubs, and forests, was observed in these periods. Additionally, accessibility to built-up areas, DEM, proximity to rice paddies, slope, proximity to street roads, accessibility to social areas, and proximity to cropland are the major spatial drivers of urban growth in the province. The study concludes that rapid urban expansion is evident in the province at the expense of other land use types, especially agricultural land use types, which may impact food security and livelihoods in the province.

AB  - Urban stormwater systems traditionally used "grey" infrastructure to manage runoff. Contemporary designs now incorporate "green" infrastructure, which offers additional potential benefits such as urban amenities and health. Understanding how green and grey infrastructure investments are distributed across urban areas is important for new goals of promoting environmental justice in planning. In California, for instance, public investments increasingly require a percentage of funds to be spent in disadvantaged communities. Recent advancements in the availability of high-detail geographic data in cities can support prioritising investments to fulfil these multiple benefits. This paper analyses the distribution of stormwater infrastructure in Los Angeles (LA) County in relation to design criteria, urban structure and sociodemographic information. It demonstrates an approach for identifying projects that simultaneously address engineering needs and promote equity. Statistical analysis of high-detail sewer locations reveals geographic correlations with key local design parameters, urban characteristics and sociodemographic indicators. Watershed areas in LA County were identified that support multi-benefit projects, meeting dual criteria for infrastructure improvements and disadvantaged community status. As stormwater systems are increasingly designed for multi-benefit outcomes, new design frameworks can emphasise both performance and social equity.

AB  - Spatial equity embeddedness in fragmented open space has long been neglected but is now becoming a pivotal topic in sustainable urban development. It is unclear whether open space fragmentation has widened existing spatial inequalities. Thus, this study proposes an integrated methodological framework of open space frag-mentation and its associated spatial equity issue in towns at different stages of urbanisation development. Hong Kong's built-up area could provide a typical case to unveil this topic due to the high shortage of open space, continued urbanisation, high immigrant rate, large wealth gap and aging population. The characteristics of open space fragmentation forms in old and new towns are elaborated through landscape pattern analysis and principal components analysis. Spatial horizontal equity and spatial vertical equity based on demographic characteristics and social economic status are portrayed by means of the Theil index and spatial matching. The findings indicate that the heterogeneity of open space fragmentation is evidenced by the uneven distribution of residents' envi-ronments in the old and new towns. Statistics reveal that in addition to shape fragmentation, the mean values of use fragmentation, internal fragmentation, extensive fragmentation and location fragmentation in old towns are all larger than those in new towns. Additionally, internal fragmentation overall is embedded in more spatial horizontal inequalities, and there is a higher level of spatial horizontal inequality in old towns than in new towns. Vulnerable groups that rely more on open spaces, including children, the elder, low education groups, immigrant groups and unemployed groups, suffer more from spatial vertical inequalities in old towns than in new towns. The knowledge gained from this research could provide a valuable reference for open space planning at home and abroad.

AB  - India's urbanisation is considered the largest national urban transformation of the 21st century, with its trajectory having a decisive impact on carbon emissions globally. This study defines and operationalises the concept of energy sufficiency for the growth of Indian cities which is expected to be largely driven by low- and middle-income housing. It combines theoretical framing with quantitative assessment of test models to present an operational framework of energy sufficiency that can be implemented through urban planning regulations. Based on the global budgetary limit to restrict global warming to 1.5 degrees C, a precautionary target of 1.0 tCO2 per capita per year is estimated as an energy sufficiency allowance for upcoming residential built environments. By optimising the average dwelling size, limiting the land-use intensity to low-rise (four storeys) and compact urban forms, and improving operational energy performance with adaptive thermal comfort, the carbon emissions from residential buildings can be sufficiently optimised to 0.84 tCO2 per capita per year. The integration of rooftop renewable energy can further reduce it to 0.56 tCO2. The co-benefits of the optimised costs of construction and operation make the case for economic feasibility and wider affordability.

AB  - Non-Point Source Pollution (NPS) caused by polluted and untreated stormwater runoff discharging into water bodies has become a serious threat to the ecological environment. Green infrastructure and gray infrastructure are considered to be the main stormwater management measures, and the issue of their cost-effectiveness is a widespread concern for decision makers. Multi-objective optimization is one of the most reliable and commonly used approaches in solving cost-effectiveness issues. However, many studies optimized green and gray infrastructure under an invariant condition, and the additional benefits of green infrastructure were neglected. In this study, a simulation-optimization framework was developed by integrated Stormwater Management Model (SWMM) and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) to optimize green and gray infrastructure for NPS control under future scenarios, and a realistic area of Sponge City in Nanchang, China, was used as a typical case. Different levels of additional benefits of green infrastructure were estimated in the optimizing process. The results demonstrated that green-gray infrastructure can produce a co-benefit if the green infrastructure have appropriate Value of Additional Benefits (VAB), otherwise, gray infrastructure will be a more cost-effectiveness measure. Moreover, gray infrastructure is more sensitive than green infrastructure and green-gray infrastructure under future scenarios. The findings of the study could help decision makers to develop suitable planning for NPS control based on investment cost and water quality objectives.

AB  - As cities and states across the United States increasingly commit to building decarbonization, gas stoves are garnering public health attention because, in addition to contributing to greenhouse gas emissions, they may pose a respiratory health risk. Disadvantaged groups, as defined by demographic, socioeconomic, and residential factors, are often late adopters of new technology. To ensure that disadvantaged groups are not left behind from this transition, WE ACT for Environmental Justice, a New York City community-based environmental justice organization, implemented the first pilot of gas-to-electric stove transition in low-income housing. The goal of this mixed-methods study was to evaluate the effect of this intervention on indoor air quality and to characterize the distinct experiences of low-income residents. Twenty low-income households were recruited and randomized to an intervention (replacement of gas stove with induction stove) and a control arm. Between October 2021 and July 2022, three 168-hr long monitoring campaigns were conducted to assess indoor air quality (NO2, CO, and PM2.5) and stove use pre- and postintervention. The impact of cooking events on indoor air quality was further evaluated during controlled cooking tests carried out in both gas and induction homes. To identify key characteristics of the end-user experience throughout this intervention, participants were invited to join focus group discussions. Between baseline and endline, 168-hr average NO2 and CO concentrations decreased in both study arms, likely due to seasonality factors. Still, the induction arm showed a 56 % reduction (95 % CI: -61.9 %, -15.2 %) in mean daily NO2 concentration compared to the gas arm. During controlled cooking tests, the median background NO2 concentration (18 ppb) in gas homes rose to 197 ppb and negligibly changed in induction homes. During focus group discussions, participants unanimously reported being pleased with the transition and highlighted quality of life improvements resulting from the unexpected intervention's ability to address energy insecurity concerns. Taken together, our quantitative and qualitative results suggest that decarbonization energy transitions can improve health by reducing indoor NO2 but need to extend beyond single appliance swap-out to address health issues resulting from energy insecurity.

AB  - In the present, regional policy faces the demanding task of developing suitable decisionmaking tools for regional development that will effectively take into account the need to mitigate climate impacts. Blue-green infrastructure (BGI) emerges as one of the most promising tools in this field. BGI represents an integrated approach that harnesses the synergistic effect of natural and civic systems to manage water, regulate climate, and protect biodiversity. This comprehensive approach not only helps reduce the risks of floods, soil erosion, and drought but also contributes to improving the environment and the quality of life of residents. In our contribution, we focus on the agricultural landscape interconnected with the urbanized part of the Nitra region. In the Nitra region, Which includes not only the city of Nitra but also 12 urban districts with 39 surrounding municipalities and a total population of 164,820, the construction of an extensive BGI network is proposed as a crucial part of measures to adapt to climate change. This network of natural and semi-natural measures is to be closely integrated into regional development plans with the aim of supporting sustainable development and increasing the region's resilience to ever-growing climate challenges. Our contribution informs the reader about the benefits of BGI in the design of the concept of regional development as a requirement set by the state based on the strategy of building elements to mitigate climate change with an emphasis on landscape activities and the urbanized landscape.

AB  - Ongoing urbanization leads to problems such as densification, loss of biodiversity, and social injustice in cities. For increasing urban populations, green–blue infrastructure (GBI) is an important element in compact cities contributing to human health, well-being, and the provision of important ecosystem services. We analyzed responses from two open-ended questions about visions, ideas, and topics for the development and management of GBI important for citizens of the city of Leipzig, Germany. The questions were part of an online survey accompanying the development of the local GBI planning strategy: Master Plan Green. The strategy is focusing on five guiding themes that are leading local and global debates about sustainable and resilient cities: biodiversity, climate adaptation, environmental justice, health, and sustainable mobility. We categorize citizens' ideas and suggestions, summarize frequent problems and conflicts, and link ideas and visions to the five guiding themes. As the last step, we discuss citizens' suggestions in order to minimize conflicts in GBI and to identify deficits in present local planning. Major problems and conflicts that were addressed by respondents relate to quality, usability, other users, activities, and safety and security of GBI. Numerous suggestions aimed to tackle these problems, for example, by designating separate use areas, adding naturalness, improving maintenance, and enhancing facilities. A range of ideas and suggestions were based on diverging expectations underpinning the challenge of matching heterogeneous demands of GBI users in an equitable fashion. Linking these suggestions to the five guiding themes reveals that most ideas are covered by one or several guiding themes and are considered in local planning strategies. However, findings also demonstrate that increasing the quantity of Leipzig's GBI is a central request from respondents. Sociocultural and economic aspects as well as conflicting demands among citizens should further be central to GBI planning to avoid injustice and achieve sustainability objectives. This analysis gives insights into opinions and visions of citizens regarding the development of the city's GBI network and thus substantiates major strategic and planning themes leading global and local urban strategies toward sustainable cities. Considering specific suggestions and GBI deficits that bother citizens on a local level, offers the opportunity to improve the social and ecological resilience of GBI.

AB  - The transition to more circular practices in the construction sector offers an alternative path to the predominant linear, high-polluting, and wasteful processes. To better understand the full impact of building materials and buildings over their lifespan and beyond, life cycle assessment (LCA) studies have been a field of interest and a growing body of knowledge over the past three decades. Moreover, recent studies stress the critical relevance of the end-of-life (EoL) scenario, particularly for wood-based construction, highlighting its potential for further decarbonization through circular strategies such as design for adaptability, disassembly, and reuse. However, there is a significant knowledge gap in the LCA literature related to environmental impact mitigation strategies specific to affordable housing options, despite the pressing and undeniable need for these typologies. This study contributes to filling this gap by performing a detailed whole-building LCA of an affordable single-family house prototype built in the south of the USA using a standard light wood frame construction method. Besides the standard as-built scenario, this study developed five hypothetical scenarios that evaluated the influence of different EoL options (recycling or energy recovery), increased circular strategies (reuse), and substitution of non-renewable materials with regenerative materials for insulation (wood fiber) and finishing (clay plaster), aiming to identify further possibilities and limitations for decarbonization of such typology and construction method. The results of this study consistently pointed out that priorities should be to (1) guarantee proper end-of-life of metals and wood-based materials. (2) To replace non-renewable materials with regenerative wood or earth-based ones. (3) To improve material reuse and construction waste diversion rates. The results of this study support the development and implementation of policies and regulations for affordable housing, aiming toward increased environmental justice and a more equitable and sustainable built environment for all.

AB  - Given the current climate emergency and the ambitious targets of carbon emissions reduction, retrofitting strategies on existing buildings typically include reducing energy demand, decarbonising the power supply, and addressing embodied carbon stored in materials. This latter point redefines the role of engineers in the transitions towards a sustainable construction sector, being they responsible for designing low impact, sustainable and carbon neutral solutions. A Life Cycle Structural Engineering (LCSE) approach, inspired by the principles of Life Cycle Thinking (LCT), should thus be adopted for the sustainable renovation of existing buildings. Only recently have pioneering approaches been proposed, tackling multifaceted buildings’ needs, such as those related to energy consumption as well as seismic safety, but often disregarding LCT principles. This study presents a redefinition of the concept of LCSE for sustainable construction and a comprehensive review of available methods and tools to operationalise the LCSE approach in practice, focusing on the consideration of LCT principles in the retrofitting design process, integration of seismic loss estimation and environmental impact assessment, and implementation of integrated retrofitting strategies. The greatest ambition of this work is thus to boost a paradigm shift for building engineers towards an interdisciplinary perspective in building assessment and retrofitting.

AB  - Wildlife are increasingly recognized as critical to urban ecosystems, but the impacts and benefits of wildlife on people in cities are poorly understood. Environmental justice scholarship has concluded that elements of the urban environment can create or exacerbate social inequity, but human-wildlife interactions have not been considered through this lens. We conducted a literature review on urban wildlife, human-wildlife interactions and environmental justice. We triangulated between these three bodies of literature to identify trends, gaps and research needs. We identified six pathways through which wildlife presence or absence, wildlife management and human-wildlife interactions in cities may lead to social injustice for people. Our review shows that wildlife affect nearly all aspects of urban life for people, including economics, participation in decision-making, patterns of urban space, human health, psychological well-being and cultural discourses. Through these six pathways, urban wildlife management disproportionately impacts marginalized and vulnerable communities and benefits affluent urban residents. Contemporary intersections of urban planning, wildlife management and histories of systemic bias exacerbate existing injustices in cities. Synthesis and applications. Though wildlife are often characterized as 'good' or 'bad' based on their effects on people, we conclude that this dichotomy perpetuates injustice for people and wildlife. Instead, we argue that a 'just city' fosters healthy wildlife populations through equitable decision-making. The pathways we lay out here offer a road map for incorporating environmental justice into urban wildlife management.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - As major hubs for energy and resource consumption and carbon emissions, cities are at the forefront of the discussion on the impacts of megatrends, such as demographic changes, technological advancements, and the shift toward climate neutrality. Despite growing literature suggesting pathways for cities to cope with these challenges, the intersection between circular economy and urban agriculture for sustainable urban development has been little explored, especially concerning practical applications. To bridge this gap, this study aimed to explore the role of urban agriculture in promoting the circularity of resources at the city level. Aarhus, in Denmark, and angstrom s, in Norway, provide the empirical context for this discussion that uncovers the barriers that impact the successful implementation of C-E practices in the context of UA and delves into how these obstacles challenge cities in transitioning to circular and sustainable food production models. Using a case study approach and qualitative data sources, the findings suggest that while urban agriculture demonstrates potential in reducing resource consumption, it requires further evidence-based research and clear monitoring tools to assess its environmental impact and economic viability. Obstacles to urban agriculture implementation include regulatory challenges, social acceptance of waste, high investment costs, and limited recognition of its indirect impacts. Concerning recommendations, local governance and public policies were found to play a central role in fostering circular urban agriculture by promoting collaboration, fostering innovation, developing regulatory frameworks, and showcasing successful examples.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this article is to evaluate the thermal comfort in Belém based on climatic variation and afforestation, considering its relationship with public policies from the administration of António Lemos to the current period. The analysis is based on historical and climatic data, as well as afforestation indicators, and seeks to understand how these policies contribute to urban sustainability and the fulfillment of SDG 11 goals. Theoretical Framework: The work is based on the concepts of Sustainable Development, with an emphasis on the dynamics of cities and urban management, considering the context of public policies aimed at environmental management. Aspects related to thermal comfort in the face of climatic variations are addressed, as well as the relevance of urban afforestation as a mitigating strategy. The study is set in the context of Belém, the host city of COP 30, highlighting the importance of sustainable practices and integrated urban policies to face contemporary environmental challenges. Method: The method adopted in the study combines a theoretical and literature review covering physiographic, climatic and historical aspects related to the territorial and urban formation of Belém, with a focus on thermal comfort, climate change, afforestation and the city's green areas. As a complement, tables, charts and graphs are used to analyze data collected from secondary sources, including the Environmental Index Indicators for Brazil's Capitals and the 2010 Municipal Basic Information Survey (Munic), published by the IBGE (2024). In addition, temperature variations in the city are analyzed, based on records from the National Institute of Meteorology (INMET). Results and Discussion: The results show a variation of 1.96°C in the maximum temperature in Belém between 1970 and 2023, indicating a growing trend of thermal warming. This evolution highlights the need for integrated and effective responses to limit global warming to 1.5°C, through adaptation and mitigation measures. Public policies for sustainable urban planning, expanding green areas and encouraging resilient practices are essential strategies for mitigating the impacts of rising temperatures. This study seeks to contribute to the debate on the challenges and possibilities of implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Brazilian urban contexts, especially in cities in the Amazon region. Research Implications: The thermal rise identified intensifies the impacts on urban thermal comfort, increasing vulnerability to heat waves, health problems and pressure on infrastructure. This reality reinforces the urgency of adaptation and mitigation measures, such as sustainable urban planning, expansion of green areas and resilient practices to contain the effects of warming. Hosting COP 30 in Belém is an opportunity for international projection and a turning point for urban and environmental management, which can catalyze public policies, modernize planning instruments and encourage greater social participation in decisions that affect the population. Originality/Value: This study contributes to broadening the debate on the challenges and possibilities of implementing the SDGs in Brazilian cities, especially in the Amazon. It highlights the importance of holding COP 30 т Belém, considering sustainable urban development as a collective process that requires collaboration between governments, civil society and international actors, aiming for global goals, quality of life and socio-environmental justice.

AB  - Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is undergoing rapid urbanization, yet research comparing urban expansion and agricultural land loss in peri-urban areas is scarce. This study utilizes multi-temporal Landsat imagery to examine the impact of urban growth on agricultural land and fragile ecosystems in Kampala (a mega city) and Mbarara (a regional urban center) in Uganda. We distinguish between random and systematic land-use and land-cover (LULC) transitions in the landscape. The results reveal substantial urban expansion. Kampala's urban area surged from 7.14% in 1989 to 55.10% in 2015, while Mbarara increased from 6.37% in 2002 to 30.95% in 2016. Correspondingly, agricultural land decreased, from 48.02% to 16.69% in Kampala, and from 39.92% to 32.08% in Mbarara. Notably, a significant proportion of urban growth in both cities encroached upon agricultural land (66.7% in Kampala and 57.8% in Mbarara). The transition from agricultural to built-up areas accounted for 14.72% to 28.45% of the landscapes. Additionally, unsustainable practices led to the conversion of wetlands and forests to agricultural land, with approximately 13% of wetlands and 23% of Savannah and forests being converted between 2001 and 2015. These findings underscore the necessity of monitoring LULC changes for sustainable urban growth management, emphasizing the importance of preserving agricultural land and ecosystems to ensure present and future food security. This research contributes to the understanding of urbanization's impact on peri-urban agricultural land and ecosystems in SSA, providing insights that are crucial for informed urban planning and policy formulation aimed at sustainable development in the region.

AB  - Residential and non‐residential buildings are a major contributor to human well‐being. At the same time, buildings cause 30% of final energy use, 18% of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE), and about 65% of material accumulation globally. With electrification and higher energy efficiency of buildings, material‐related emissions gain relevance. The circular economy (CE) strategies, narrow, slow, and close, together with wooden buildings, can reduce material‐related emissions. We provide a comprehensive set of building stock transformation scenarios for 10 world regions until 2060, using the resource efficiency climate change model of the stock–flow–service nexus and including the full CE spectrum plus wood‐intensive buildings. The 2020–2050 global cumulative new construction ranges from 150 to 280 billion m2 for residential and 70‐120 billion m2 for non‐residential buildings. Ambitious CE reduces cumulative 2020–2050 primary material demand from 80 to 30 gigatons (Gt) for cement and from 35 to 15 Gt for steel. Lowering floor space demand by 1 m2 per capita leads to global savings of 800‐2500 megatons (Mt) of cement, 300‐1000 Mt of steel, and 3‐10 Gt CO2‐eq, depending on industry decarbonization and CE roll‐out. Each additional Mt of structural timber leads to savings of 0.4‐0.55 Mt of cement, 0.6‐0.85 Mt of steel, and 0.8‐1.8 Mt CO2‐eq of system‐wide GHGE. CE reduces 2020–2050 cumulative GHGE by up to 44%, where the highest contribution comes from the narrow CE strategies, that is, lower floorspace and lightweight buildings. Very low carbon emission trajectories are possible only when combining supply‐ and demand‐side strategies.

AB  - This study investigates the potential of biochar production from urban pruning waste as a sustainable solution within a circular economy framework. Urban green waste, often underutilized, typically increases landfill burden and greenhouse gas emissions. Converting pruning waste into biochar reduces landfill reliance while enabling stable carbon sequestration. Utilizing the circular triple-layered business model canvas (CTLBMC), biochar’s impact is evaluated across economic, environmental, and social dimensions. This structured analysis is based on a theoretical framework and uses secondary data to illustrate the model’s applicability. As a result of the conducted studies, it was found that biochar derived from urban green waste not only improves soil phytotoxicity and enables long-term carbon sequestration, but also offers economic benefits, including municipal cost savings in waste management and diversified revenue streams from biochar sales. Socially, biochar production promotes community engagement in sustainable practices and supports urban greening initiatives, enhancing local ecosystems. The findings suggest that biochar production, assessed through the CTLBMC framework, represents a viable circular business model. This approach provides significant environmental, economic, and social benefits over conventional disposal, offering valuable insights for policymakers, waste management professionals, and urban planners advancing circular economy solutions.

AB  - Food production on the urban-rural fringe is under pressure due to competing land uses. We discuss the potential to improve resilience for urban-rural regions by enhancing food production as part of multifunctional land use. Through studies of peri-urban land in the regions of Gothenburg (Sweden), Copenhagen (Denmark) and Gent (Belgium), recent developments are analysed. Arable farming has been declining since 2000 in all three areas due to urban expansion and recreational land use changes. In city plans, networks of protected areas and green spaces and their importance for human wellbeing have been acknowledged. Policies for farmland preservation in peri-urban settings exist, but strategies for local food production are not expressed in present planning documents. Among the diversity of peri-urban agricultural activities, peri-urban food production is a developing issue. However, the competing forms of land use and the continuing high dependence of urban food on global food systems and related resource flows reduces peri-urban food production and improvements in urban food security. The positive effects of local food production need to be supported by governance aiming to improve the urban-rural relationship. The paper discusses the resilience potential of connecting urban-rural regions and re-coupling agriculture to regional food production.

AB  - A loss of natural capital within cities and their surrounding areas has been noticed over the last decades. Increasing development associated with higher sealing rates has caused a general loss of Urban Green Spaces (UGS) within the urban environment, whereas urban sprawl and the improvement of road networks have deeply fragmented the surrounding landscape and jeopardized ecosystems connectivity. UGS are an essential component of the urban system, and their loss has a greater impact on, e.g., ecological and hydrological processes, threatening human well-being. Different types and spatial configurations of UGS may affect their own ability to provide ecosystem services, such as biodiversity support and water regulation. Nevertheless, the study of UGS spatial patterns is a research branch poorly addressed. Moreover, UGS analyses are mainly focused on public and vast green spaces, but seldom on informal, private, and interstitial ones, returning a myopic representation of urban green areas. Therefore, this study investigates the UGS spatial patterns within six Southern European cities, using the urban morphology analysis to assess all urban vegetated lands. Results revealed three main Urban Green Spatial Patterns (UGSPs): Fragmented, Compact, and Linear Distributions. UGSPs taxonomy represents a novelty in the urban morphology field and may have important implications for the ability to provide ecosystem services and, thus, human well-being.

AB  - The concept of Planetary Boundaries has sparked debate around tipping points and the limits of the Earth System for over a decade. Among the most investigated aspects is how to downscale this global concept to a country level, to make it operative at scales at which decisions are taken and policies applied. Specifically how to achieve applicability locally while keeping global relevance, however, remains unclear. The same is true for the "Doughnut" concept, which builds on the Planetary Boundaries framework and adds a social component to create a "Safe and Just Operating Space" (SJOS) within which humanity should live. This paper reviews these two concepts in detail, focusing on their local operability. Synthesis of the literature reveals that, during the downscaling process, either the global meaning of the Planetary Boundaries or the local characteristics of a country are lost. Further, the SJOS remains a very theoretical concept because a match does not exist between the Planetary Boundaries and the social components of the Doughnut. Identification of this problem therefore suggests that future work should calculate the Planetary Boundaries globally for each ecosystem first, and then downscale them by country. In this way, the global relevance of the Planetary Boundaries would hold, and the framework could apply to local policies. Furthermore, the ecosystem services could link the Planetary Boundaries with the social aspects of the Doughnut, and hence contribute to understanding why a country lies within or outside the SJOS.

AB  - There is a rising demand to use nature and natural processes to address a different range of urban issues, especially when looking at the risk of pluvial flood associated with climate changes and urbanization processes. Among the set of Nature-Based Solutions used in urban planning, Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) represent promising solutions to reduce the negative effects of urban water run-offs and to increase urban Ecosystem Services. However, SUDS can impact differently in the urban fabric and generate positive effects only on particular portions of cities. Planning of SUDS should try to consider not only the number of potential beneficiaries but also where beneficiaries are located in the city, as water sensitive approaches to urban planning must deal with distributive, procedural and contextual dimensions of equity. In this paper, we simulate different spatially explicit planning scenarios of SUDS for densely populated catchments in Sicily. Particularly, we evaluate the relation between the quantitative performance of SUDS in terms of reduction of hazard/risk of pluvial flooding and the number and location of beneficiaries -intended here as residents of different social groups. Results suggest that scenarios of SUDS generate benefits that are not equally distributed within the city.

AB  - Bohai Rim has been marked as the most advanced economic development zones in northern China, which also brought along a series of issues such as high energy demand, resources depletion, environment pollution, etc. At this exact economic and ecological joint, China and Singapore governments proposed to develop an energy efficient, resources saving, environmental friendly and livable city over the 30sqkm abandoned saline-alkaline land, as a model that could be applied or duplicated for other cities development. This paper took Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city as the case to study the planning strategies of sustainable and energy efficient city development. Renewable energy uses were introduced in various forms with full consideration on its respective economical sustainability to meet the 20% renewable energy usage Key Performance Indicators (KPI) of Eco-city's vision. All buildings are designed and built to comply with the Green Building Evaluation Standards (GBES) to save up to 70% of the energy demand of conventional build environment. By 2030, 90% of the city residents' daily trips will be green electrical private vehicles, public transport such as light rail transit (LRT), tram and electrical buses, cycling, walking. Smart grid, intelligent home energy management system, digitalized civic services enables a new lifestyle towards energy efficient and sustainable society.

AB  - Sustainable urban development is an increasingly important concept as cities around the world continue to grow and face challenges related to urbanization, including environmental degradation, social inequality, and economic instability. Chiang Mai is a rapidly growing city in Thailand that steers towards sustainability. In this work, we examine the state of sustainable urban development in Chiang Mai by analyzing various indicators, including transportation, waste management, air quality, and energy consumption. A multi-dimensional framework was used to assess the sustainability of Chiang Mai. Our analysis suggests that while Chiang Mai has made progress in some areas of sustainable urban development, such as promoting green transportation and waste reduction and reduction consumption, there are still many challenges to be addressed, particularly in air pollution, water management, transportation and energy consumption. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for policy makers, urban planners, and other stakeholders interested in promoting sustainable urban development. This study assesses Chiang Mai’s sustainability using a comprehensive set of 35 indicators. It was found that Chiang Mai has potential for sustainable development, but some indicators require improvement. The study presents guidelines for prioritizing sustainable development, improving air and water quality, promoting sustainable tourism, enhancing waste management, transportation management and energy consumption. This research provides alternative framework for evaluating cities and presents a valuable contribution to the field of sustainable urban development.

AB  - Do higher urban densities contribute to more sustainable cities and communities? This paper examines the effectiveness of higher density (as a means) for achieving sustainable urban development (the goal) following three lines of enquiry. First, a systematic review of the scientific literature (n = 229 peer-reviewed empirical studies) is presented on the effects of urban density. Second, the motivations for increasing urban density are studied in a systematic review of Swedish planning practices based on the comprehensive urban plans in 59 municipalities. Third, these two studies are compared to find matches and mismatches between evidence and practice. Although positive effects exist for public infrastructure, transport and economics, there are also considerable negative environmental, social and health impacts. This creates a challenging task for urban planners to assess the trade-offs involving densification and accommodate current urbanisation rates. Some topics are found to be over-represented in research (transport effects), seldom discussed in practice (environmental impact), and misaligned when comparing motives and evidence (social impact). Furthermore, for some topics, urban density thresholds are found that are important because they may explain some of the divergences in the results between studies.Practice relevanceThe transfer of knowledge from research to planning practice is a serious concern as planning strategies are not aligned with scientific evidence. Planning practice in Sweden is more positive about the contribution of higher density to sustainable urban development than the results of empirical studies warrant. The largest deviation is found in relation to the social impacts of higher density where the planning arguments are not aligned with the evidence. Several reported negative effects of densification (e.g. water management, recreational infrastructure, biodiversity) are not sufficiently accounted for in Sweden’s planning policy and strategy. The narrow planning focus on decarbonising cities and densification needs to be broadened to ensure cities are resilient against the effects of climate change and include mitigation strategies to reduce negative social, environmental and health impacts. The findings can be used to develop evidence-based planning strategies. Other countries can apply this process to assess their planning strategies.

AB  - 100 Positive Energy Districts (PEDs) are to be created in Europe by 2025, with a stated goal of urban decarbonization. These are highly energy efficient residential urban areas, powered entirely through renewables. PED creation is to be guided by principles of quality of life, sustainability, and inclusiveness (specifically focusing on affordability and energy poverty prevention). Although there is research into the decarbonization aspects of PEDs, there has been little focus on the guiding principles, and their potential to reduce energy vulnerability. Using energy vulnerability factors and an energy justice framework, this article examines how the topic of energy vulnerability mitigation is perceived by professional PED stakeholders. Stakeholders from multiple countries were interviewed in order to determine how and to what extent they approached the topic of inclusivity and energy vulnerability. The contribution of this paper to academic research is in helping to frame energy vulnerability in European smart city urban areas, focusing on the perceptions of key stakeholders. This contributes to research on the identification and evaluation of innovations such as PEDs which offer a potential model for an inclusive transition. Furthermore, this article offers a contribution for policymakers, informing PED replication policies with a focus on the synergistic aims of decarbonization and energy vulnerability mitigation.

AB  - The systematic review used PRISMA guidelines to examine the impact of carbon pricing mechanisms on energy poverty and socio-economic outcomes. Furthermore, Scopus and Web of Science databases were searched for articles published between 1984 and 2023. Nine key themes emerge, including sustainable urban development, renewable energy transition, and governance challenges in energy distribution. The findings underscore the implications of the mechanisms for energy security and socio-economic aspects in developing nations. These mechanisms span multiple SDGs, including SDGs 1, 2, 4, 7, and 11. These findings have several implications, among others, (i) Strategically allocating carbon pricing revenue, e.g. targeted social programmes or investments in renewable energy, can counteract adverse effects and contribute to social equity. (ii) revenue from energy-related policies can be leveraged to alleviate energy poverty through rural electrification and infrastructural development. This study contributes insights for policymakers and practitioners emphasising the interconnectedness of environmental policies with broader development objectives.

AB  - In recent years, the climate change crisis has become a serious concern and has heightened public perceptions of environmental awareness and the importance of ecological sustainability. Human-induced climate change poses a grave and dangerous threat to our entire ecosystem. Climate change profoundly impacts all life on Earth, driven by the overexploitation of resources and unsustainable choices. This threatens our health, security, and survival. Blue-green infrastructure presents significant opportunities to address complex multifaceted urban concerns, including global temperature rises and biodiversity loss. This research focuses on how blue-green spaces play a crucial role in minimizing the cascading risks through nature-based solutions as an efficient approach to managing natural resources sustainably. It also explores how the integrated blue-green infrastructure projects benefit human wellbeing and increase the livability quotient. This research utilizes a wide range of evidence to demonstrate how various global case studies involved in blue-green infrastructure (BGI) projects positively impact health and social cohesion. This study has important implications for policymakers and urban planning practitioners and can potentially help decision-makers prioritize more holistic and socially inclusive BGI projects.

AB  - The significance of urban landscapes in safeguarding biodiversity is often disregarded, even though a considerable amount of conservation focus is directed toward biodiversity hotspots where urban land conversion is happening at the fastest pace. Maintaining biodiversity in urban areas not only benefits the environment, but along with social, economic, and technological factors can increase the stability of urban systems to disturbance, a concept known as "urban resilience". In this synthesis paper, we explore the ecological dimension of urban resilience and specifically focus on avian biodiversity because birds are easy to observe, relatively abundant, and can serve as an indicator of the overall health of urban environments. We first examine the concept of ecological resilience and discuss the role of environmental stressors associated with urbanization in the ongoing avian biodiversity crisis. We then provide an overview of characteristics of the urban environment that may promote ecological resilience in birds, and associations between social and economic factors and urban ecological resilience. Finally, we provide recommendations on future research regarding strategies to improve urban ecological resilience and thus, urban resilience as a whole, at the intersections of urban ecology, ecosystem ecology, environmental justice, and urban planning. Since 68% of the world's population is projected to live in urban areas by 2050, it is imperative that scientists, urban planners, civil engineers, architects, and others consider urban ecological resilience as a dimension of both environmental health and the resilience of cities to future natural and anthropogenic stressors.

AB  - Introduction Smart cities, artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare, and low-carbon building materials are pivotal to public health, environmental sustainability, and green efficiency. Despite their critical importance, understanding public perceptions and attitudes toward these domains remains underexplored. Additionally, the effective use of advanced technologies like convolutional neural networks (CNN) in predicting and promoting low-carbon solutions in construction is gaining attention.Methods This study employs a dual approach: (1) A survey of 200 respondents was conducted to gauge public perceptions and attitudes toward smart cities, AI in medicine, and low-carbon building materials. (2) A CNN model was developed and implemented to predict the performance of low-carbon building materials. The model utilized convolutional and pooling layers to capture local features and spatial information from image datasets, with tasks including image classification and segmentation.Results The survey results indicate high awareness of smart cities (80%), with 60% associating them with environmental protection and green living. For AI in medicine, 70% of respondents are aware of its applications, but only 45% perceive it as environmentally beneficial. Regarding low-carbon building materials, 60% expressed willingness to pay premium prices, and 65% recognized their positive environmental impact. The CNN model demonstrated high prediction accuracy on both training and validation datasets, effectively aiding in the identification of low-carbon materials and reducing building energy consumption and carbon emissions.Discussion The findings highlight significant public awareness and diverse attitudes toward these critical domains, suggesting the need for improved communication and advocacy for AI's environmental benefits. The application of CNN models in the construction industry showcases a promising pathway to enhance material selection efficiency and foster sustainable practices. These insights are essential for aligning public understanding with technological advancements to achieve environmental and public health goals.

AB  - The buildings and construction sector is responsible for 37% of energy-related CO2 emissions and over 34% of energy demand globally. The redevelopment of the existing residential building stock has become a consolidated policy of the European Commission to implement the objectives of economic recovery and energy transition towards climate neutrality by 2050. This paper illustrates the design experimentation conducted by the Sapienza University team on the recovery of the public housing compartment R5 in Tor Bella Monaca, Rome. The research proposes an original methodology that is ideally replicable for regenerating large public housing districts built on the outskirts of major European cities, characterised by significant technological and social degradation and energy deficiency. This paper provides an overview of the interventions and an evaluation of the method and set of tools developed in drafting the Technical and Economic Feasibility Study at both the neighbourhood and building levels. This contribution is addressed to researchers and public and private organisations dealing with the complexity of the social housing recovery topic, emphasising overall sustainability aspects of interventions in terms of typological and energy refurbishment of buildings, re-activation of open spaces and enhancement of landscape components, and envisioning new services through participatory methods that promote social inclusion.

AB  - A steady stream of ecosystem services is essential for human welfare and survival, and it has been convincingly shown that these flows are being eroded. Compelling theoretical knowledge about essential connections between ecosystem service generation, biodiversity, and resilience in social-ecological systems already exists; however, we still, to a great extent, lack spatially explicit quantitative assessments for translating this theoretical knowledge into practice. We propose an approach for measuring the change in flow and resilience of a regulating ecosystem service on a landscape scale over time when the landscape is exposed to both land use change due to urban expansion, and change in a large-scale economic driver. Our results quantitatively show that there can be a substantial decrease in resilience due to negative effects on response diversity without detecting any major decrease in ecosystem service generation over time, thus generating a sense of false security and sustainability.

AB  - Concerns over climate change have driven the need for decarbonization of the building sector all over the world. It is proven that manufacturing building materials consumes a substantial amount of non-renewable energy and releases carbon emissions. For this reason, it has become an essential need for finding clean and energy-efficient alternative building materials. In Bangladesh, vernacular houses in rural areas are made of locally found materials like mud, bamboo, thatch, wood, and others and are always used in the construction of houses without any industrial processing, these dwellings are composed of materials with very little or no embodied energy (E.E). However, there has been a significant change in the construction of houses and the use of materials in rural Bangladesh in the last two decades. Concrete, brick, metal sheets, and many other industrial materials have taken possession of indigenous technology and bio-based materials. As a result, environmentally sustainable traditional houses have been transformed into energy-intensive houses. This research aims to study vernacular building materials in Bangladesh to identify their embodied energy, climatic performance, thermal conductivity, and durability for constructing low-carbon and less energy-consumed buildings. Based on several case studies, field surveys, and literature reviews the assessment has been conducted, showing that these materials are highly efficient in terms of embodied energy and can also ensure great thermal comfort. This study also evaluates the durability of these materials and depicts that by enhancing their durability, these materials can act as the best-performing building materials in all aspects.

AB  - Global municipal solid waste (MSW) generation will increase to 2.2 billion tons per year by 2025 as per the World Bank projection. Improper waste management often leads to environmental degradation (i.e. water, air and soil pollution), transmission of diseases, and the release of greenhouse gases emissions, which contributes to climate change. To combat these problems, several countries are following the waste to energy (WtE) approach, which significantly reduces the volume of waste and generates renewable energy. Thus, the present study focuses on the municipal solid waste generation, composition, and waste to energy conversion technologies. Thermal conversion processes including incineration, pyrolysis, and gasification for heat, bio-oil, and syngas generation are already well established and are being employed in several countries. Currently, researchers are trying to improve the efficiency of biochemical methods such as anaerobic digestion, microbial fermentation, and microbial fuel cells for biogas, biohydrogen, and bioelectricity generation from MSW. This review explains the recent focus on microbial fermentation and microbial fuel cells for biofuels and bioelectricity production. Development of these technologies can lead to suitable eco-friendly approaches for the future. WtE technologies are important components of circular economy that will assist to achieve the demand of clean energy in future.

AB  - In this study, municipal solid waste (MSW) composition in distinct world locations is compared and a case study is assessed. Three waste-to-energy (WtE) techniques are employed within the framework of an industrial partnership. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and a brief social contextualization including the production of renewable energy from the waste generated worldwide were held to attain a holistic view and attract the interest of multiple stakeholders.Incineration depicted a sustainable profile with improved results for global warming potential and terrestrial ecotoxicity potential. Regular gasification revealed the best results for eutrophication, acidification, marine aquatic ecotoxicity and human toxicity potential. Two-stage plasma gasification showed negative values for all impact categories i.e. achieving environmental credits. The estimate of the electricity produced from the waste generated per capita showed a fair coverage of the electrical demand in distinct world areas.To the best of the authors' knowledge, there are no reports connecting the electricity use, the waste production and the renewable energy achieved from WtE for different world regions. Therefore, this study supports the replacement of fossil fuels with renewable alternatives, reducing greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining the comfort and commodities suitable for a comfortable quality of life.

AB  - Urban expansion and associated land use/land cover (LULC) changes have major implications for environmental sustainability within smart city frameworks. This paper presents an artificial intelligence (AI) based remote sensing (RS) approach to monitor and map complex LULC distributions towards informed sustainable land management. Specifically, we develop a deep neural network model that integrates high-resolution satellite data with sustainability-focused LULC classification schemes. Through a case study in the Bangalore Urban region, we demonstrate approximately 90% classification accuracy in mapping fine-scale LULC types related to climate resilience, food security, biodiversity, and urban green space. Results also quantify spatiotemporal LULC changes from 2000-2023, revealing rapid expansion of built-up areas along peri-urban zones and declines in wetlands/forests. In addition to offering a scalable technique for smart cityfocused LULC monitoring, the proposed AI-RS framework also produces data to support policy decisions on ecological conservation zones, sustainable urban growth borders, and climate-adaptive landscapes. The discussion of wider generalizability across various metropolitan locations emphasizes the adaptability and significance of integrated AI-RS tools for environmental planning in the face of global urbanization trends that are happening at a rapid pace. For long-term planning and policies regarding sustainable urban expansion, increased monitoring of LULC redistribution is crucial as Bangalore moves forward with its official Smart City program. Nagendra et al. (2013) defines the 5230 km2 Bengaluru municipal area to include an extensive and varied landscape made up of huge peri-urban areas, intense cities, and scattered woods. The number of possibilities offered an optimal study setting for delicate spatial scale AI-RS model development and evaluation.

AB  - Rising vulnerability of the urban green infrastructure (UGI) is grabbing global attention, for which inclusive urban landscape and greening policies (ULGP) and frameworks are crucial to support green growth. As such, this research intends to explore the local community’s perspective to assemble sustainable UGI indicators for vital taxonomy of the urban green space (UGS) elements, aiming to develop a multi-functional and sustainable UGI-indicator-based framework that is eco-friendly and supports green-resilient cities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, Pakistan. An in-depth household survey was executed in three KP districts: Charsadda, Peshawar, and Mardan, placing self-administered 192 questionnaires while covering themes around climate change adaptation, urban resilience, and UGI. Relative importance index (RII) and the interquartile range (IQR) methods were set up for data analysis that revealed excellent reliability (α > 0.88) and internal consistency. The results confirmed community-based UGI indicators with a focus on promoting green-energy-saving strategies as e-imp (level 9, RII = 0.915), while other (ten) UGI indicators as important (RII = 0.811–0.894) and (eleven) as moderately important (RII = 0.738–0.792). These UGI indicators were found to be enhanced by UGS elements (RII ≥ 0.70). These findings provide a foundation for urban policy change and the development of a sustainable UGI framework to build an eco-regional paradigm for greener growth.

AB  - Climate-induced pressures spur on the need for urban green infrastructure (UGI) planning. This approach offers a possible way to improve ecosystem functionality and human well-being in adversely affected urban regions, wherein UGI is perceived as a green and nature-based climate change mitigation/adaptation strategy. In Pakistan, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province lacks such urban landscape and greening policies (ULGP) or legislative frameworks for transitioning to green action plans (GAP), to alleviate the risk of multi-climatic hazards. Thus, this study aims to investigate a sustainable UGI-indicator-based framework model, based on the due inclusion of the concerned stakeholders. The relative importance index (RII) and inter-quartile range (IQR) techniques are employed for field data analysis. The findings proclaim excellent reliability (α > 0.7) and internal consistency, wherein sustainable UGI indicators are grouped based on their importance. The results portray the ecological and economic sustainability dimensions as being important (RII = 0.835 and RII = 0.807, respectively), socio-cultural dimensions as being moderately important (RII = 0.795), and a set of UGS elements (RII ≥ 0.77) as vital for bolstering individual UGI indicators. The main UGS elements emerging in each category can be grouped as follows: ecological category—“reducing rainwater runoff” (RII = 0.94); socio-cultural category—“enhancement of mental and physical health” (RII = 0.90); and eco category—“minimizing the risk of flood disasters” (RII = 0.96). The simulation results demonstrate the need for an inclusive perspective when building the urban green space (UGS) infrastructure (and standards) that will be most suitable for ensuring climate-resilient urban regions. This study contributes to putting the scientific research knowledge of the natural green-landscape-based (NBLB) approach into practice. The study calls for the establishment of an effective, pragmatic relationship between the urban landscape and greening policies, alongside a constructive relationship with the native inhabitants to ensure eco-friendly and resilient settlements.

AB  - Despite providing valuable ecosystem services (benefits people derive from nature), desert golf courses consume enormous amounts of water and can exacerbate water scarcity in drylands. Yet, few studies have assessed the sustainability of desert golf from a landscape sustainability perspective, which centers on the linkages among landscape pattern, ecosystem services, and human well-being. Focusing on the Phoenix Metropolitan Area (PMA) of USA, a global golf epicenter, this study investigated the relationships among golf course spatial pattern, water use, ecosystem services, and environmental justice. Our analysis revealed that there are 210 golf courses in the PMA, together making up roughly 3.5% of total regional water demand. Furthermore, we found that people from high-income brackets have greater access to the benefits provided by golf courses than those in low-income brackets. To improve desert golf sustainability, we need to design courses that use less water and provide a wider range of ecosystem services beyond the game of golf, including climate regulating services and cultural services. Golf courses should be considered explicitly in sustainable landscape design, with particular emphasis on the diversity and accessibility of ecosystem services they provide in a regional context.

AB  - Mining wastes, particularly in the form of waste rocks and tailings, can have major social and environmental impacts. There is a need for comprehensive long-term strategies for transforming the mining industry to move toward zero environmental footprint. "How can the mining industry create new economic value, minimise its social and environmental impacts and diminish liability from mining waste?" This would require cross-disciplinary skills, across the social, environmental, technical, legal, regulatory, and economic domains, to produce innovative solutions. The aim of this paper is to review the current knowledge across these domains and integrate them in a new approach for exploiting or "re-thinking" mining wastes. This approach includes five key areas of social dimensions, geoenvironmental aspects, geometallurgy specifications, economic drivers and legal implications for improved environmental outcomes, and circular economy aspirations, which are aligned with the 10 principles of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM). Applying circular economy thinking to mining waste presents a major opportunity to reduce the liability and increase the value of waste materials arising from mining and processing operations.

AB  - A loss of natural capital within cities and their surrounding areas has been noticed over the last decades. Increasing development associated with higher sealing rates has caused a general loss of Urban Green Spaces (UGS) within the urban environment, whereas urban sprawl and the improvement of road networks have deeply fragmented the surrounding landscape and jeopardized ecosystems connectivity. UGS are an essential component of the urban system, and their loss has a greater impact on, e.g., ecological and hydrological processes, threatening human well-being. Different types and spatial configurations of UGS may affect their own ability to provide ecosystem services, such as biodiversity support and water regulation. Nevertheless, the study of UGS spatial patterns is a research branch poorly addressed. Moreover, UGS analyses are mainly focused on public and vast green spaces, but seldom on informal, private, and interstitial ones, returning a myopic representation of urban green areas. Therefore, this study investigates the UGS spatial patterns within six Southern European cities, using the urban morphology analysis to assess all urban vegetated lands. Results revealed three main Urban Green Spatial Patterns (UGSPs): Fragmented, Compact, and Linear Distributions. UGSPs taxonomy represents a novelty in the urban morphology field and may have important implications for the ability to provide ecosystem services and, thus, human well-being.

AB  - According to the “Urban Health Rome Declaration” at European meeting “G7 Health” that defines the strategic aspects and actions to improve Public Health into the cities, and referring to the Agenda 2030 in which the 11th SDG argue about “Sustainable Cities and Communities. Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”, one of the most expressive syntheses of the challenging relationship between urban planning and Public Health is stated by WHO (2016): “Health is the precondition of urban sustainable development and the first priority for urban planners”. Referring to the Healthy Cities & Urban Health definitions, we can consider Public Health not merely an aspect of health protection and promotion, but an individual and collective condition, strongly influenced by the environmental context and by the strategies implemented by local Governments. The “Health in All Policies” strategy, clearly underlines how health doesn't depend only on the supply of the healthcare services, but also, on the quality of outdoor and indoor living environments. Aim of the Presentation 3 is the share the findings of a literature review about the link between the urban contexts' morphological and functional features; the results are divided into: 14 Health Outcomes, representing the main Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) whose come from the urban environment's quality and by the adoption of healthy lifestyles; 8 types of Environmental Risk Factors (Urban Heat Island Effect; soil/air/acoustic/light pollution; vehicular traffic; Safety & Security; weak attractiveness of places); and 14 Healthy Urban Planning Strategies (green/blue/grey infrastructures; biodiversity protection; adverse meteoric events management; public transport systems; vehicular traffic reduction; pedestrian and cycling paths; social and functional mix; urban solid waste's management; renewable energy and efficiency; outdoor spaces lighting; Design for All).

AB  - This study explores the critical role of effective landfill management in enhancing urban resilience amidst the growing challenges of climate change. With global municipal solid waste projected to rise 69 % from 2016 levels to 3.4 billion tons by 2050, addressing improper waste disposal-currently affecting 67 % of waste-has become imperative. This mismanagement contributes significantly to environmental degradation, public health risks, and soaring economic costs, projected to increase by 154 % from 2020 to USD 640.3 billion by 2050 without intervention. The study emphasizes the necessity for advanced landfill technologies, such as bioreactor landfills, smart waste management systems, and the integration of digital twins and IoT. These innovations can enhance waste processing efficiency, cut greenhouse gas emissions, and yield economic benefits. For instance, bioreactor landfills can boost methane (CH4) production by up to 49 %, facilitating renewable energy generation. Additionally, green infrastructure, waste-to-energy technologies, and improved landfill designs are proposed to mitigate the effects of climate change, including extreme weather events that threaten landfill integrity and emissions stability. Key findings highlight the importance of integrating landfill resilience into urban planning and sustainable waste management strategies. A holistic approach combining technology, policy reforms, and community participation is recommended to build robust urban waste management systems capable of withstanding climate-related challenges. This work underscores the transformative potential of advanced waste management technologies in achieving resilient and sustainable urban systems, contributing significantly to global efforts in combating climate change.

AB  - Green spaces and trees are key elements for enhancing human well-being in cities. Despite recognizing the significance of urban greenery for human health, the role of urban biodiversity in shaping well-being remains poorly understood. This study focused on the interplay between tree genera diversity, perceived urban biodiversity, and the subjective well-being of urban residents in Karlsruhe, Germany. A map-based online questionnaire involving 302 participants investigated well-being locations and perceptions of biodiversity. Tree genera diversity was assessed for nine genera using remote-sensing and ground data. A novel approach of spatially correlating societal mapping results and tree genera cover maps revealed a clear preference for green spaces in the built-up urban environment. The relations between computed tree genera diversity and subjective well-being were unclear. However, there was a significant relationship between the perceived biodiversity of urban green spaces and subjective well-being. The amount of tree cover, the abundance of large trees, as well as the perceived species diversity beyond tree genera, lead to increased well-being of the urban population. At the same time, a perceived unkemptness of urban areas had a negative effect on the residents' well-being. This should be considered in future research and the design of urban green spaces.

AB  - Adaptive reuse, the repurposing of buildings for new uses, is an age-old practice designed to reimagine, remake and revitalize local economies, cities and communities. In more recent decades, reuse has become part of a systematic process of contemporary city building and a globalized practice of placemaking. As such adaptive reuse is much more that a technical or practical application but is rather a complex process that engages with and transforms the social, cultural and spatial dynamics of cities and their communities around the world. This article focuses on the contemporary geographies of adaptive reuse and highlights three key themes: reuse in the post-industrial city, reuse on the 'edges' and 'peripheries' of the global built environment, and reuse as part of the global sustainability discourse. Overall, this review highlights the rich and growing research across urban, cultural and environmental geography and exposes a number of ways in which this process operates as a powerful tool in shaping local and regional contexts.

AB  - The paper presents the intermediate results of the design experimentation of a Public Housing development in which the Renewable Energy Community model is an opportunity for energy transition but also for the needs of social inclusion and collaboration, which characterise the complex conditions of contemporary housing. Demonstrating the transcalar and multifunctional effectiveness of RECs incentivises their implementation, especially when a complex demanding framework is confronted with limitedly available resources. Hence, through a systemic approach, simulative methods and impact indicators, the extent of the contribution offered by the REC model was verified not only in terms of decarbonisation and climate neutrality but as an opportunity for eco-social regeneration.

AB  - In this study, municipal solid waste (MSW) composition in distinct world locations is compared and a case study is assessed. Three waste-to-energy (WtE) techniques are employed within the framework of an industrial partnership. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and a brief social contextualization including the production of renewable energy from the waste generated worldwide were held to attain a holistic view and attract the interest of multiple stakeholders. Incineration depicted a sustainable profile with improved results for global warming potential and terrestrial ecotoxicity potential. Regular gasification revealed the best results for eutrophication, acidification, marine aquatic ecotoxicity and human toxicity potential. Two-stage plasma gasification showed negative values for all impact categories i.e. achieving environmental credits. The estimate of the electricity produced from the waste generated per capita showed a fair coverage of the electrical demand in distinct world areas. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there are no reports connecting the electricity use, the waste production and the renewable energy achieved from WtE for different world regions. Therefore, this study supports the replacement of fossil fuels with renewable alternatives, reducing greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining the comfort and commodities suitable for a comfortable quality of life.

AB  - This paper examines the spatial and temporal trajectories of Seattle's industrial land use restructuring and the shifting riskscape in Seattle, WA, a commonly recognized urban model of sustainability. Drawing on the perspective of sustainability as a conflicted process, this research explored the intersections of urban industrial and nonindustrial land use planning, gentrification, and environmental injustice. In the first part of our research, we combine geographic cluster analysis and longitudinal air toxic emission comparisons to quantitatively investigate socioeconomic changes in Seattle Census block-groups between 1990, 2000, and 2009 coupled with measures of pollution volume and its relative potential risk. Second, we qualitatively examine Seattle's historical land use policies and planning and the growing tension between industrial and nonindustrial land use. The gentrification, green cities, and growth management conflicts embedded within sustainability/livability lead to pollution exposure risk and socioeconomic vulnerability converging in the same areas and reveal one of Seattle's significant environmental challenges. Our mixed-method approach can guide future urban sustainability studies to more effectively examine the connections between land use planning, industrial displacement, and environmental injustice. Our results also help sustainable development practitioners recognize that a more just sustainability in Seattle and beyond will require more planning and policy attention to mitigate obscured industrial land use conflicts.

AB  - This study aims to systematize indicators and indices that allow measurement sustainable development in cities and towns (economic, social, and environmental). It is one dimension that is inseparable from current cities and its extent is a major concern for political decision‐makers worldwide, and also present their individual weights in that performance. The results allow construction of a Composite Index for Sustainability supported by multivariate statistical techniques (Exploratory Factor Analysis and Principal Component Analysis), confirming its scientific quality and robustness, and forming the main contribution of this study. The results also show that the urban sustainability dimension is visible in the 308 Portuguese cities/towns in a tri‐partite way. Economic sustainability (weighting of 0.386) has been strengthened by entrepreneurship, which has created new business supported by public–private partnerships, such as living labs, which has contributed to less urban unemployment. Standing out in social sustainability (weighting of 0.245) is the development of projects promoting cohesion and social inclusion and actions to improve social infrastructure in Portuguese towns. Finally, environmental sustainability (weighting of 0.369), which locally in Portugal, has emphasized waste management and actions to preserve and protect natural resources and the environment in general. However, more effective actions are needed for their sustainability to continue to improve substantially in the long term, for example, environmentally. Furthermore, the towns/cities analysed must change to the circular economy model as proposed by the European Union.

AB  - The accumulation of waste has a profound impact on the environment, prompting a crucial discussion about effective waste management strategies aligned with Oman Vision 2040's sustainability goals. The consequences of municipal solid waste generation have multifaceted impacts on the environment, public health, and overall well-being of communities. Addressing these consequences requires a holistic approach that includes the integration of sustainable waste management technologies to foster a circular economy. This paper emphasizes the necessity for a paradigm shift in waste management methodologies, emphasizing the importance of Hyperspectral Imaging and Big Data Analytics into municipal solid waste management processes. This paper explores the synergistic relationship between hyperspectral imaging which is capable of precise material identification, and big data analytics to facilitate comprehensive data analysis. The integration aims to optimize waste segregation, resource recovery, and recycling processes. The utilization of data-driven insights enables predictive modeling and the identification of trends thereby facilitating more efficient and sustainable waste management practices. The harnessing of big data analytics empowers stakeholders to make informed decisions in waste management to achieve long-term environmental, and economic sustainability.

AB  - The greenhouse gas emitted due to transportation is the third greatest emitter globally, and its impact has become a threat to the environment, public health, and economic development. Waste transportation is excluded in studies of waste management despite its significant environmental impacts such as global warming and human toxicity. The objective of this study is to develop a quantification model to estimate the carbon footprint of waste transportation and environmental impact assessments in three categories applied in Tehran using IPCC guidelines. In Tehran, light and heavy vehicles ran on diesel fuel. Data on fuel and waste characteristics were provided by Tehran’s department of transportation and municipality, respectively. In this study, transport-related emissions are 8.47 k tonCO2eq/y, and the carbon footprint of waste transportation is 93.57 g of CO2 eq per ton of waste transported (t.km), which is relevant to three main parameters: the amount of waste transported annually, the freight shipped from the temporary station to the disposal landfill site, and fossil fuels consumed. Also, an environmental impact assessment in three categories – human health (global warming, abiotic depletion, and ozone layer depletion), resources (fossil fuels), and ecosystem quality (acidification and eutrophication) – using SimaPro, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tool is presented. Global warming (3.49 kg CO2 eq/t MSW), human toxicity (0.95 kg 1,4-DB eq/t MSW), and freshwater aquatic eco-toxicity (0.04 kg 1,4-DB eq/t MSW) have the greatest impact among categories. Sensitivity analysis of the effective parameters allows us to conclude one of the potential implications of this study would be the introduction of natural gas or biogas-based trucks replacing diesel fuel vehicles to improve air quality and mitigate the greenhouse gas emission.Implications: This paper addresses the significant issue of global warming, particularly in Iran, a developing country that ranks among the top contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. The study emphasizes the importance of evaluating emissions across various sectors such as electricity, waste, etc., Specifically, in this paper we focus on developing a model to quantify the environmental impact resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels in vehicles, focus on the metropolitan city of Tehran as a case study. By examining the waste transportation process, we aim to provide decision-makers with effective strategies to mitigate the environmental consequences. In this paper, we develop a simple quantification term of Carbon Footprint to calculate total greenhouse gas emission of waste transportation process. Carbon Footprint is a fraction which, its numerator is total greenhouse gas emission and its denominator is total waste transported in traveled distance. Effective parameters have been investigated and based on parameters and emission factors taken out of IPPC, the carbon footprint model have been developed. The total greenhouse gas emission of this study and the carbon footprint has estimated at 8.47 k tonCO2eq/y and 93.57 g CO2eq/t.km respectively. Furthermore, the paper explores additional environmental impacts beyond global warming, including abiotic depletion, ozone layer depletion, acidification, eutrophication, human toxicity, photochemical oxidation, and freshwater aquatic eco-toxicity. Using SimaPro software these eight impact categories have been estimated. in this study we identify fossil fuel consumption, traveled distance, and mass transported are the primary parameters influencing greenhouse gas emissions and the carbon footprint. To reduce emissions in the waste transportation system, we suggest promoting renewable biofuels, highlighting Iran as a suitable candidate due to its high percentage of biodegradable material in municipal solid waste. Additionally, the study assesses nonrenewable energy and mineral extraction using the IMPACT 2002+ V2.15/IMPACT 2002+ method, revealing that global warming (100 years), human toxicity (100 years), freshwater aquatic eco-toxicity, nonrenewable energy, and mineral extraction have the most significant impacts on the municipal solid waste transportation system. Overall, this research underscores the need for quantifying environmental impacts and recommends strategies to mitigate them in waste transportation processes, particularly in developing countries like Iran.

AB  - This paper supports the idea of agroecology playing an integral role in development ‘smart cities’ and its application in different settlement contexts in South Africa. As alluded to in the People-Centered Smart Cities framework, the application of the smart cities approach can be extended to various settlement contexts. This paper promotes ‘the smart city’ concept in different contexts, including rural and small settlement environments, incorporating agroecology, a paradigm which guides us towards building sustainable and equitable urban environments. This approach can significantly contribute to the improved and more resilient design and development of human settlements. The Preferred Reporting Items for Reviews and Meta-analysis were employed to analyze primary and secondary data sources, thereby formulating descriptive and analytical themes around agroecology and smart cities. This paper utilized 54 articles, offering a robust foundation for the paper’s analysis and discussions. Additionally, the paper underscores the adherence to policy and legislative spaces for smart city strategy-led budgeting. It advocates for robust financial policies and long-term development financial strategies aligned with several the Sustainable Development Goals, but especially SGD 11, which is to create inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities and habitats. The construction of smart campuses, smart rural settlements, and smart school programs is demonstrated by the Centre for Ecological Intelligence at the University of Johannesburg’s food systems hub, the Phumulani rural agrivillage, and the Eastern Cape and Tshwane food security school programs. These showcase projects act as compelling models illustrating how the principles of smart cities can be applied to diverse settlement contexts.

AB  - Developing countries with rapid urbanization face challenges in providing sufficient energy to both rural and urban households in an efficient manner. However, few empirical studies explored both energy sufficiency and efficiency inequality in rural and urban households at the sub-national level within a nation during a rapid urbanization period to inform equitable energy transitions. Therefore, this research collected 2000-2019 subnational-level data in China to explore the pattern of rural-vs-urban inequality in energy use per person (indicating sufficiency) and energy use intensity (EUI, indicating efficiency). Gini coefficients and disparity ratios, two social inequality measurements, were used to quantify social inequality in energy use. Fixed effect models with interaction terms were adopted to explore the impact of income, energy end-use structure, and floor area on energy use differences between rural and urban households. Gini coefficients of both energy measurements decreased by 43%-47% from 2000 to 2019, suggesting a more equitable distribution of end-use energy sufficiency and efficiency between urban and rural households. Rural-vs-urban disparity ratios showed that rural households in more provinces used more energy per person with higher EUI than urban households in 2019, compared to the pattern observed in 2000. Income in rural households had a statistically significant larger impact on energy use per person and EUI than that in urban households. By evaluating energy inequality in both sufficiency and efficiency from an overlooked rural-vs-urban perspective, this study enhances the understanding of social inequality in energy use and provides valuable insights into just energy transitions in urbanizing and developing countries.

AB  - HighlightsThis special issue is dedicated to the topic of energy sufficiency, where the guiding question is how decent living standards for all can be ensured without exceeding planetary boundaries. Despite increasing recognition of the importance of exploring sufficiency for cities, buildings and infrastructures, before this special issue little specialist literature has been available. Thomas Princen’s seminal work on sufficiency as an organising principle for sustainable living, with both a sense of ‘enoughness’ and ‘too muchness’, is a shared starting point. Papers in this issue varied in the aspects of energy sufficiency investigated and methods used: some focused on creating conceptual advances, others presented new empirical work from single or multiple countries, with citizens, professionals, policymakers and practitioners all centred in one or more contributions. Findings suggest that sufficiency can be integrated into city planning, building design, and everyday household and neighbourhood practices, while identifying the infrastructures that shape and support these changes. Sufficiency has been explored in relation to travel patterns, occupation of residential space, sharing facilities and heating practices. The benefits and challenges of living well with less have been identified for varied populations and places. There is still more work to do. There is a need to expand geographical scope. Research gaps remain in linking sufficiency to prosperity, in understanding actor–networks for sufficiency in ways that transcend the usual silos of ‘consumption domains’ or ‘policy sectors’, in recognising the role of infrastructure, and in understanding the practicalities of ‘doing’ sufficiency in our buildings and cities.

The concept is particularly relevant to depopulated areas across Japan facing a continuous increase of underutilised agricultural land that brings environmental, social and economic challenges. This study recognises such land as a locally available resource to be re-utilised under the CES framework and mitigate issues in a depopulating community. Using the case of the Hachinohe City Region in Japan, this paper explores alternative land-use scenarios and identifies policy interventions to implement a desirable scenario that would contribute to the localisation of Net-Zero and regional revitalisation. The scenarios developed based on land-use change analysis, policy reviews and stakeholder interviews were: (1) an energy-dominant scenario (installing a photovoltaic system) and (2) an agriculture–energy combination scenario (installing an agrivoltaic system). The analysis shows that under both scenarios, Hachinohe City Region can achieve 100% renewable energy. There are other benefits, including job creation and, in the case of the agriculture-solar scenario, contribution to domestic food supply resiliency. The study recommends three policy interventions: (1) collaboration amongst the members of the city region to achieve its own carbon–neutral electricity supply; (2) investment for areas without transmission lines to fully benefit from their regional resources; and (3) support for local initiatives where local communities co-manage the resources and co-benefit from them. Based on the results, the paper further highlights the potential of the CES approach to deliver just transition from a spatial perspective.

AB  - The aim of this article is to see how awareness of sustainable development and environmental justice can be increased and operationalized in planning through the use of scenarios. On scrutinizing four long-term urban development strategies for Stockholm, we found that they all intend to depict a sustainable urban development, but the resultant images are very different. This article underlines the importance of combining environmental justice with an understanding of environmental threats and risks. We see that the carrying capacity of nature is limited, but we also see the need to share resources justly and make sure that environmental degradation does not systematically strike certain groups only. The conceptual elements are applied to four scenarios for a future Stockholm, zooming in to some extent on a suburban shopping node just outside the city. The point of focusing on it is that such shopping areas are sometimes seen as symbols of non-sustainable city development, but, since they are already in place, their function in the future city needs to be discussed.

AB  - The current study seeks to explore the underexamined or potentially under-researched social dimensions of circular economy (CE) in the context of buildings. Utilising a meta-synthesis approach, this paper builds on the two primary theoretical frameworks in the well-being literature: the eudaimonic and hedonic perspectives. The analysis of the selected articles reveals that these frameworks foster distinct modes of interaction and perception concerning one’s environment. A consensus is evident among the studies reviewed, advocating for integrating both eudaimonic and hedonic elements to achieve optimal well-being and happiness. Moreover, some scholars argue that for the attainment of sustainability goals and, by extension, CE objectives, the eudaimonic approach to well-being should be emphasised over the currently predominant hedonic inclinations. The research also attempts to open a discourse between the sometimes rather comprehensive, holistic, and hard-to-quantify dimensions of human well-being and the more logical, measurable, and tangible results-oriented approach towards the built environment. This investigation illustrates how well-designed building elements, aligned with CE principles, can play a pivotal role in fostering both environmental sustainability and human flourishing in the built environment.

AB  - Metropolitan areas increasingly confront complex challenges related to food security, social inequality, environmental degradation, and resource scarcity, exacerbated by rapid urbanization, climate change, and the reliance on extended, fragile supply chains. Urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) is recognized as a promising approach to mitigate these issues. For example, it enhances food security and nutrition by strengthening local food supply systems, improves livelihoods by providing employment and income for local residents, and promotes environmental sustainability through the creation of greening spaces and reduction of food miles. However, the full potential of UPA remains constrained by various technological, economic, and social barriers, such as limited growing spaces, lack of land tenure security, low economic efficiency, and insufficient public awareness and acceptance. Given that the technological innovations are critical in overcoming these barriers and maximizing the positive impacts of UPA, this review provides a state-of-the-art overview of advanced technologies and tools applicable to UPA, aiming to inform how these innovations can be better enabled to enhance UPA’s contributions to sustainable urban food systems. The review begins by defining UPA, categorizing its various forms, and exploring its multifunctional roles within urban contexts. It then presents a thorough analysis of a range of UPA technologies that serve specific purposes, including productivity and product quality improvement, space utilization optimization, resource recycling, and land use management. Furthermore, the review evaluates the current challenges faced by these technologies throughout the stages of research and development (R&D), dissemination and extension, and application and commercialization, employing an analytical framework adapted from Technology Life Cycle theories. In conclusion, the review emphasizes the crucial roles that UPA and relevant technological innovations play in transforming food systems and urban environments. It proposes four key recommendations: (1) enhancing funding mechanisms and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration for UPA R&D, (2) strengthening UPA technology dissemination systems, (3) promoting economic feasibility and market integration within UPA business models, and (4) establishing supportive environments among all stakeholders in the innovation process. These targeted strategies are essential for scaling UPA technologies, thereby strengthening food security, environmental sustainability, and socio-economic resilience in metropolitan areas.

AB  - Throughout human history, cities have been centres of prosperity, ideas and innovation. These days, smart cities are creating a new buzzword across the world. Examples boom in Japan, Europe, UAE and Singapore while several others are shaping up on the drawing board. With the recent announcement of 100 new Smart Cities, the Government of India has strategically responded to both the international call for innovation and transformative sustainability as well as growing domestic pressure in cities. Interestingly, there is neither an internationally accepted definition of a Smart City, nor does India have any national policy on urbanization. Within this science-policy vacuum, there is a fair degree of consensus on what a smart city looks like, but no understanding on what are the inputs and strategies to achieve one. With numerous expectations, inhibitions and euphoria around this theme, this paper attempts to systematically investigate what is a smart city, how it is different from similar prototypes like a sustainable, green and low-carbon city and what are the global best practices. The article addresses some of the ideological, technical, societal, governance and financial challenges that India faces to attain the '00 Smart Cities' goal, and what would be its policy implications. In the process, the research proposes a new idiom for SMART-Sustainability, Metrics, Adaptiveness, Reporting, Technology for Inclusiveness.

AB  - Social housing typically encompasses neighbourhoods with low social-economic status. Here, environmental problems like climate change and biodiversity loss have a higher impact than in other neighbourhoods. Applying Nature-based Solutions (NbS) may enhance the resilience of social housing neighbourhoods and as such make cities more just. In this article we explore to what extent NbS can be applied, given the physical, social and financial limitations that define Dutch social housing practice, and -by doing so - what NbS can contribute to environmental justice. Based upon several Living Lab experiences and dialogues with numerous housing cor-porations, ten NbS measures have been identified that likely will match with current practices in social housing. Implementing NbS contributes to all aspects of environmental justice, with distributional justice as the most straightforward one (more NbS means more environmental benefits). Procedural and recognitional justice were found to be of crucial importance to make greenspaces worthwhile for the residents. Our study draws attention to the fact that NbS knowledge is key but currently still insufficient, both within housing corporations as within the key partners (local authorities, landscaping firms). This means that there is a growing demand to increase NbS knowledge in the social housing sector. We finalize this article with recommendations on how to meet this demand.

AB  - The building and construction sector accounts for around 39% of global carbon dioxide emissions and remains a hard-to-abate sector. We use a data-driven analysis of global high-level climate action on emissions reduction in the building sector using 256,717 English-language tweets across a 13-year time frame (2009-2021). Using natural language processing and network analysis, we show that public sentiments and emotions on social media are reactive to these climate policy actions. Between 2009-2012, discussions around green building-led emission reduction efforts were highly influential in shaping the online public perceptions of climate action. From 2013 to 2016, communication around low-carbon construction and energy efficiency significantly influenced the online narrative. More significant interactions on net-zero transition, climate tech, circular economy, mass timber housing and climate justice in 2017-2021 shaped the online climate action discourse. We find positive sentiments are more prominent and recurrent and comprise a larger share of the social media conversation. However, we also see a rise in negative sentiment by 30-40% following popular policy events like the IPCC report launches, the Paris Agreement and the EU Green Deal. With greater online engagement and information diffusion, social and environmental justice topics emerge in the online discourse. Continuing such shifts in online climate discourse is pivotal to a more just and people-centric transition in such hard-to-decarbonise sectors.

AB  - Trees are frequently unevenly distributed in urban areas, and their diversity, abundance, and composition vary spatially. Some studies have shown that the unequal distribution of urban trees can be associated with de-mographic and socioeconomic factors. However, most studies have been conducted in diffuse urban systems using remotely-sensed tree cover within single or aggregated land-use types. We examined if the relationship between tree diversity, abundance, composition, and socioeconomic factors varied across land-use types (parks, streets, zonal areas, and total) in the compact city of Barcelona, Spain. We calculated tree species richness and abundance across 73 neighborhoods using 229,962 geo-referenced records of individual trees sampled in 2021. Life expectancy positively explained tree richness and abundance across land-use types, reinforcing that access to urban green infrastructure promotes longer life spans. In contrast, income did not positively explain tree richness or abundance, indicating that tree distribution does not directly result in biodiversity and green space in-equalities for disadvantaged groups in terms of income. Total tree composition across neighborhoods responded to socioeconomic gradients, evidencing that neighborhood appearances are socially stratified. Street tree abundance increased in densely populated neighborhoods, possibly because intense street tree plantings in these neighborhoods compensate for the lack of other green infrastructure. Urban tree planting, particularly in streets, can be an effective strategy to increase green spaces in compact cities to overcome the disparities resulting from the unequal distribution of urban vegetation. Long-term data on socioeconomic factors and urban tree distri-bution are necessary to determine how social stratification affects urban diversity.

AB  - Urban ecosystems, and the services they provide, are a key focus of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, specifically SDG 11, which emphasizes making cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. Green infrastructure (GI) is crucial in enhancing citizens’ quality of life and achieving this goal and it can be defined as a strategically planned network of natural and semi-natural areas designed to deliver a range of ecosystem services (ESs). These infrastructures improve ecosystem functioning, protect biodiversity, promote health, support sustainable land and water management, and boost the local green economy. This paper explores the scientific literature on GI and their ESs in cities using bibliometric science. By combining the keywords “Green Infrastructures”, “Ecosystem Services”, and “Cities” with VOSviewer software (1.6.20 version), we analyzed trends over time. Results show growing attention to these topics, emphasizing human well-being, urban resilience, and sustainability. The study also highlights that focusing exclusively on either “Green Infrastructure in Cities” or “Ecosystem Services in Cities” leads to fragmented insights. A more integrated examination of these three domains offers a holistic view and underscores the importance of considering ecosystem disservices. The study further identifies key research directions, including the need for a comprehensive evaluation of diverse GI types, especially those that are under-researched, such as green roofs, sports areas, and wetlands, and the underexplored role of cultural ecosystem services. Additionally, future research should consider both the benefits and disservices of GI to support better urban planning decisions. Finally, integrating biophysical, social, and economic values of ESs is critical for providing more holistic insights and enhancing sustainable urban development. The novelty of this paper lies in its integrated, holistic approach to examining GI and ESs in urban areas, with a focus on ecosystem disservices, insufficient attention to specific GI types, and the role of cultural ecosystem services—each contributing to the creation of more resilient and sustainable cities.

AB  - The Indian government advocates for a major shift from national reliance on coal to more renewable energy sources. While these aspirations are laudable, a political ecology review reveals the uneven power relations associated with the introduction of renewable energy in the southern Indian state of Kerala. Drawing from fieldwork, research traces how Kerala government solar projects, including schemes to promote rooftop solar, prioritize middle- and upper-class consumers. Historically marginalized communities, including people living below the poverty level and Adivasis (indigenous peoples), are not a priority for the state agency implementing renewable energy and thus are not beneficiaries of cleaner energy. This disconnected approach builds from and exacerbates historical political and resource inequalities and enables the persistence of social and environmental injustices, even while moving towards a lower-carbon future. This model does not allow for all residents to actively engage in decision-making about energy processes and proves to be a missed opportunity to think holistically about development and energy in tandem. Energy democracy provides ideas to disturb this uneven power structure, with cooperatives being one possible way to implement this change. As the case of Kerala underscores, India may undergo an energy transition, but it will not be a just energy transition without significant changes.

AB  - The presence of Hydrogen sulfide, Methane, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), and other odorous compounds in the ambient air is the root cause of the offensive odor emitting from the MSW dumping yard. Composition features and health risks associated with odor emissions concentrations in MSW dumping yards. This paper aims to provide an overview of research on health problems due to their composition, ecological impacts, and potential health risks of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and to examine the relationship between VOC exposure and chronic illnesses in humans and the environment. In this study, a comprehensive investigation of VOC odor emission from an urban MSW dumping site has been performed. The VOC odor sample was analyzed using the GC-MS technique. The maximum VOCs concentration reported is due to tert - butylbenzene at 1.41 ug.m-3 and the minimum is due to Sec-butylbenzene at 0.07 ug.m"3. Scientific databases, including Google Scholar, California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA), and US EPA (Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), were searched extensively using a bibliographic technique, in addition to a case study on MSW dumping yard workers. The findings of epidemiologic and experimental research, the emission of odors as a result of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can cause a variety of non-cancerous health effects that are linked to abnormal functioning of the body's vital organs, including the nervous and coronary, and pulmonary systems. It can also have minimal impact on the environment by causing global warming and ozone layer depletion. The odor emissions from the dumpsite pose both carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic risks to the health of the individuals participating in the dumping yard. As a result of these results, it is important to manage odor emissions (VOCs) during composting and take steps to reduce their negative effects on the environment and public health.

AB  - The practice of stormwater management has evolved from a singular focus on drainage to a multifaceted approach to support the integrated urban development of healthy, livable, ecological, and water sensitive cities from neighborhood to metropolitan scales. A review of the knowledge base and practice by the professional stormwater management community shows attributes that favor an integrative approach to achieve co-benefits across sectors. Research into stormwater management addresses its functional areas of drainage, flood control, flood plain management, water quality control, urban ecology, recreation, and city beautification. Legacy path dependance affects the potential to reform land use practices, while stormwater management practice is affected by climate change, sea level rise, urbanization, inequality, and poor governance. This review shows a status where technical methods are well advanced but integrative frameworks to address social, ecological and infrastructure needs are more challenging. The sensitivity of ecological issues is most evident in cities in coastal zones. Organizational initiatives are needed to counter the neglect of essential maintenance and sustain flood risk reduction in cities. Stormwater management is related to other integrative tools, including IWRM, One Water, One Health, and Integrated Flood Management, as well as the broader concept of urban planning. This research review demonstrates the opportunities and needs for the advancement of an integrated approach to stormwater management to support urban development. Stormwater capture and rainfall harvesting offer major opportunities to augment scarce water supplies. Nature-based solutions like low-impact development and the sponge city concept show promise to transform cities. Major cities face challenges to sustain conveyance corridors for major flows and to store and treat combined sewer runoff. The neighborhood focus of stormwater management elevates the importance of participation and inclusion to advance environmental justice and strengthen social capital. Integrating organizational initiatives from local to city scales and funding improvements to stormwater systems are major challenges that require leadership from higher governance levels, although governments face resistance to change toward integration, especially in countries with poor land use and public works management systems. Finding solutions to neighborhood issues and the connectivity of water systems at larger scales requires complex approaches to urban planning and represent an important agenda for urban and water governance going forward.

AB  - With the goal of enhancing the quality of the environment, urban green infrastructure (UGI) is an essential element in sustainable cities, and nature-based solutions (NBS) are being carried out as new infrastructure solutions that increase the resilience of cities. In this research, the method of theoretical analysis and the content analysis as the basic fact-gathering technique was applied to answer to following questions: What are the hindrances and bottlenecks in implementing NBS? Are the current decision-making mechanisms helping NBS get in route to shape cities? Is there any binding policy in practice that promotes NBS? In Belgrade is planned Type 3 of the degree of intervention/level and engineering type—Creation and new ecosystem management in the classifications of intensive urban green space management; urban planning strategies; urban water management; ecological restoration of degraded terrestrial ecosystems; and restoration and creation of semi-natural water bodies and hydrographic networks. In the future, it is essential to implement policies and incentives on national, regional, and local scales that help encourage the usage of NBS in the development of urban infrastructure.

AB  - Since a solution towards carbon neutrality in already highly populated territories that does not profoundly alter the territories has not yet been found, territorial acupuncture, a new methodology presented in this paper, proposes a solution to this challenge and simultaneously helps to counter the dysfunctional dichotomy between large urban centres and small towns. The aim of this study is therefore to present this new concept and its operation. Hence, a phased study was carried out. Territorial acupuncture is the result of merging different theories and practices, such as Biourbanism, urban acupuncture, and energy community design. For Territorial Acupuncture, the territory is conceived as a single organism and, just like acupuncture in traditional Chinese medicine, punctual interventions (in this case, interconnected energy communities) would benefit the entire territory organism. To make the theory work properly, it will be necessary to carry out multi-scalar and multi-disciplinary analyses over the entire territory to identify the intervention points and then proceed to the design and interconnection of the individual district. Thus, Territorial Acupuncture provides a new approach to the resilience of densely populated territories, which, through punctual interventions on a district scale, benefits the entire territory by modifying energy, socio-economic, and environmental dynamics.

AB  - Low carbon city (LCC) has emerged as the latest sustainable urbanism strategy in China as a response to climate change impacts. Yet, minimal scholarships have explored the sustainability of the urban planning model towards understanding the complexity of the components. Using a two-step triangulation approach, this paper presents a structured overview of the LCC initiative in China as it relates to the transition to a sustainability paradigm. The data collection approach includes a comprehensive review of 238 articles on LCC to identify and categorize LCC components. Furthermore, discourse and framing analysis was used to develop and synthesize a conceptual framework for assimilating the components into four core sustainable development principles: Integration, implementation, equity, and scalability and replicability. The results indicate that LCC development in China is bias towards economic and environmental technological innovations and strategies. Additionally, several critical sustainability issues of LCC pilots were identified. These include a lack of social equity planning concerns for the most vulnerable population, dearth of social reforms that cater to lifestyle and behavioral change, top-down planning and decision-making processes, a technocratic rationalization planning approach, inconsistent LCC targets on inter-generational justice concerns, absence of an effective national "sharing and learning" city-city network system, and several barriers to implementation. We conclude that the applied theoretical and conceptual inquiry into the field of LCC is pertinent to mitigate climate change and achieve sustainable urban development.

AB  - Urban areas often face versatile stressors (e.g., food security, congestion, energy shortage, water pollution, water scarcity, waste management, and storm and flooding), requiring better resilient and sustainable infrastructure systems. A system dynamics model (SDM), explored for the urban region of Orlando, Florida, acts as a multiagent model for portraying material and energy flows across the food, energy, water, and waste (FEWW) sectors to account for urban sustainability transitions. The interlinkages between the FEWW sectors in the SDM are formulated with multiple layers of dependencies and interconnections of the available resources and their external climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic drivers through four case studies (scenarios). The vital components in the integrated FEWW infrastructure system include urban agriculture associated with the East End Market Urban Farm; energy from the fuel-diverse Curtis H. Stanton Energy Center; reclaimed wastewater treated by the Eastern Water Reclamation Facility, the Water Conserv II Water Reclamation Facility, and stormwater reuse; and solid waste management and biogas generation from the Orange County Landfill. The four scenarios evaluated climate change impacts, policy instruments, and land use teleconnection for waste management in the FEWW nexus, demonstrating regional synergies among these components. The use of multicriteria decision-making coupled with cost-benefit-risk tradeoff analysis supported the selection of case 4 as the most appropriate option as it provided greater renewable energy production and stormwater reuse. The SDM graphic user interface aids in the visualization of the dynamics of the FEWW nexus framework, demonstrating the specific role of renewable energy harvesting for sustainably transitioning Orlando into a circular economy.

AB  - Prefabricated engineered solid wood panel construction systems can sequester and store CO2. Modular cross-laminated timber (CLT, also called cross-lam) panels form the basis of low-carbon, engineered construction systems using solid wood panels that can be used to build residential infill developments of 10 storeys or higher. Multi-apartment buildings of 4 to 10 storeys constructed entirely in timber, such as recently in Europe, are innovative, but their social and cultural acceptance in Australia and North America is at this stage still uncertain. Future commercial utilisation is only possible if there is a user acceptance. The author is part of a research team that aims to study two problems: first models of urban infill; then focus on how the use of the CLT systems can play an important role in facilitating a more livable city with better models of infill housing. Wood is an important contemporary building resource due to its low embodied energy and unique attributes. The potential of prefabricated engineered solid wood panel systems, such as CLT, as a sustainable building material and system is only just being realised around the globe. Since timber is one of the few materials that has the capacity to store carbon in large quantities over a long period of time, solid wood panel construction offers the opportunity of carbon engineering, to turn buildings into 'carbon sinks'. Thus some of the historically negative environmental impact of urban development and construction can be turned around with CLT construction on brownfield sites.

AB  - This paper emphasises that more holistic infrastructure systems are of great importance to achieving sustainable development of China and hence of the planet. Whilst rapid Urbanisation brings the prospect of economic growth and a higher standard of living, it may also involve unsustainable consumption of scarce resources (land, materials, energy and water), accompanied by environmental degradation (such as pollution, emissions and waste). The challenge is to achieve the necessary economic growth but with far lower resource use, and thus reduce the ecological footprint, as recognised by China's Circular Economy policy. Whilst developed nations should rightly aim for a Factor 10 improvement in resource productivity, Factor 4 is often seen as a more appropriate target for developing countries - a fourfold increase. This involves doubling wealth while halving resource use in order to return to an ecological balance. Arguably, even greater resource productivity is required. China's economy will need to achieve at least a sevenfold increase in efficiency of resource use to achieve the goal of 'all-round well-being of society' set for 2050, although some have argued that a tenfold increase (90% improvement) will be required. The paper highlights the significant contribution of transport, energy, water and built infrastructure to resource consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and the ecological footprint. It examines ways that China can move towards a Factor 10 improvement in resource productivity. This involves viewing infrastructure as 'a system to facilitate the delivery of services' to support social and economic development in an integrated, eco- or resource-efficient, cost-effective and socially inclusive manner, coupled with extending the principles of a 'product service system' more widely to an 'infrastructure service system'. It is argued that a revolution in thought and action is required to achieve the necessary paradigm shift in China, with the West leading by example.

AB  - The quotation above taken from the foreword to the UNs New Urban Agenda (NUA) adopted in 2016 epitomises how, in the urban century, there is an increasing recognition that the sustainable planning and development of cities are no longer solely matters of local, regional and national concern. What happens in cities in the remainder of this century will impact more widely on a host of international and global agendas, notably those relating to green challenges such as responding to the climate emergency, biodiversity, resource use, public health (e.g. addressing air pollution) and promoting greater environmental justice. Reflecting this, Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 of the UNs 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (UN, 2015, 26), focuses on making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable, whilst many of the other goals will require particular attention to how urban places develop if they are to be achieved. Part 1 of the NUA - the Quito Declaration on Sustainable Cities and Human Settlements for All - emphasises in its title the social goal that sustainable cities and human settlements should be for all. Part 2, the Quito Implementation Plan for the New Urban Agenda, also reflects the three dimensions of sustainability, including promoting [e]nvironmentally sustainable and resilient urban development. The signatories recognise that cities and human settlements face unprecedented threats from unsustainable consumption and production patterns, loss of biodiversity, pressure on ecosystems, pollution, natural and human-made disasters, and climate change and its related risks, undermining the efforts to end poverty in all its forms and dimensions and to achieve sustainable development' (UN HABITAT, 2017, 18). The wider significance of what happens in cities is again emphasised as the document states,

AB  - Waste management policies introduced at regional levels can have a bearing effect on sustainable development goal (SDG) achievement at such levels, promoting certain SDG targets, while hindering other SDG targets. This work introduces an empirical methodology for estimating the synergies and trade-offs for a city-level waste management policy with SDG achievements, taking the case of Kyoto City's extensive waste management policy package and its interactions with renewable energy (RE) development (SDG 7), decent economic growth (SDG 9), reduced inequalities (SDG 10), and sustainable consumption (SDG 12). Similar interactions at the national-level are also enumerated with the justified indicators at the city-level being extended to the national-level. Through pairwise correlation, multiple correlation, and regression, four hypotheses for circular economy compatibility with SDG achievement were tested. It was found that manufacturing value and small business growth is stunted by circular economy-based waste policies, while resource efficiency is promoted. Cultural and social structures have trade-offs with stringent waste management at city-levels, but is neutral at aggregated levels. RE development is also synergetic with circular economy-based waste management. This methodology shows a pathway as to how national- and city-level policies can be integrated with each other in order to optimize waste management and overall sustainability.

AB  - Alleviating energy poverty and lowering carbon emissions are two crucial goals that can help achieve sustainable regional development. However, to make this a reality, it is vital to understand the relationship between environmental governance and these goals, especially at the household level. This study utilizes microdata from the 2012-2020 China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) to construct models. We examine the synergies between reducing household energy poverty and emissions mitigation under regional policies, aiming to solve the long-standing energy poverty problem and reduce carbon emissions. Our findings emphasize that China's environmental governance exhibits significant synergies by concurrently addressing household energy security and promoting carbon reductions through integrated policy approaches. The efficacy and synergy depend critically on optimizing energy consumption structure, decreasing carbon intensity, and enabling technological advancement. These insights highlight the importance of top-level government design in balancing energy security and emissions reductions. Recommendations include establishing a robust governance framework to coordinate energy and climate goals while integrating climate and ecological governance regulations. The incomedifferentiated analysis provides valuable guidance for policymakers seeking to alleviate energy poverty and strengthen decarbonization, underscoring the importance of targeted interventions for disadvantaged households.

AB  - Sustainable transportation is vital to climate justice and social equity. Despite the efforts to achieve sustainability, there is still a lack of adequate measurement that integrates land use and transportation systems, which can be barriers to planning implementation. With methodological improvements in fuzzy theory application, this study develops an integrated index to measure the sustainability of multimodal accessibility. We do so by defining a fuzziness degree based on the different trip purposes and modes of transportation with a case study in Isfahan, Iran. Sustainable accessibility indicators were developed for walking, biking, and public transportation to represent the performance of each transportation system, considering the integration with land-use patterns. We analyze transportation modes and the accessibility to five main urban activities, including employment opportunities, education, healthcare, shopping, and recreation services, based on the travel distances, followed by a statistical integration method with Principal Components Analysis (PCA) for each travel mode. The outcome provides insights for urban planners and transportation planners to effectively evaluate the degree of integration between transportation and land-use systems and contribute to enhancing sustainable accessibility.

AB  - Built environment stocks (buildings and infrastructures) play multiple roles in our socio-economic metabolism: they serve as the backbone of modern societies and human well-being, drive the material cycles throughout the economy, entail temporal and spatial lock-ins on energy use and emissions, and represent an extensive reservoir of secondary materials. This review aims at providing a comprehensive and critical review of the state of the art, progress, and prospects of built included 249 publications published from 1985 to 2018, conducted a bibliometric analysis, and assessed the studies by key characteristics including typology of stocks (status of stock and end-use category), type of measurement (object and unit), spatial boundary and level of resolution, and temporal scope. We also highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of different estimation approaches. A comparability analysis of existing studies shows a clearly higher level of stocks per capita and per area in developed countries and cities, confirming the role of urbanization and industrialization in built environment stock growth. However, more spatially refined case studies (e.g., on developing cities and nonresidential buildings) and standardization and improvement of methodology (e.g., with geographic information system and architectural knowledge) and data (e.g., on material intensity and lifetime) would be urgently needed to reveal more robust conclusions on the patterns, drivers, and implications of built environment stocks. Such advanced knowledge on built environment stocks could foster societal and policy agendas such as urban sustainability, circular economy, climate change, and United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.

AB  - Conference Title: 2021 IEEE Conference on Norbert Wiener in the 21st Century (21CW)Conference Start Date: 2021, July 22 Conference End Date: 2021, July 25 Conference Location: Chennai, IndiaThis paper is based on the premise that the principal purpose of science and technological development should be the well-being of society in harmony with environmental sustainability. Vaclav Smil [1] argues “commonly used measures of energy use – be it conversion efficiencies, energy costs, per capita utilization levels, growth rates, consumption elasticity, or output rations – are just helpful indicators of the performance and dynamics of processes whose aim should not be merely to secure basic existential needs or to satisfy assorted consumerist urges but also to enrich intellectual lives and to make us more successful as a social and caring species.” Energy and electricity access and use is valuable not in itself, but for what it enables women and men “to do or achieve” [2]. Grubler studied the history of past energy transitions and identifies ‘grand patterns’, one of which being the critical importance of end-use — consumers and demand – “with technology and the social settings co-evolving, depending on each other” [3]. Feminist studies in science and technology treat technology as a ‘socio-technical’ product and describe the relationship between gender and technology as one of mutual shaping [4]. Gender and development studies put forward the concept of ‘gender mainstreaming’ which has been applied to infrastructure programs, such as energy, transport and digital infrastructure, based on gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) approaches. The paper draws from these frameworks. Norbert Wiener considered the resilience of urban centres in preparation for a potential nuclear attack and outlined what he considered to be some key features of urban plans. In the first draft of his urban plan, titled “Civilian Defense Plan”, his central argument is that the atomic bomb has rendered our previous understanding of civil defense obsolete and that “we need to reorganize our cities where they stand” – markets, points for medical supplies, hospitals, transportation, etc [5]. The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the inter-relatedness and inter-connections between physical infrastructure, key utilities and services, and economic, health and social outcomes. There is an urgent need to rethink and transform cities to respond to the reality of Covid-19 and potential future pandemics, and to recover better, by building more resilient, inclusive and sustainable cities. International experiences show that cities with similar densities and levels of economic development have fared very differently in their ability to contain Covid-19. This indicates that the strength and duration of impacts of Covid-19 are not solely determined by a city's population density, but also by local capacity and preparedness to deal with such crises, infrastructure and service delivery systems, citizen's trust and confidence in society's institutions and the level of functional responsibilities and resources available to them through decentralized systems. Some of the key lessons for recovery and ‘building back better’ include the importance of an effective health system response, urban and regional planning, physical distancing, city-wide slum upgrading and housing programs, land-use and regulations to regulate hygiene conditions, significantly scaling up the low-carbon energy and infrastructure transition, access to key utilities and services for poor and vulnerable groups such as women, slum and transient populations, people with disabilities and the elderly, social protection, rethinking business supply chains, more resilient and inclusive ICT and digital connectivity and a pressing need to address gender inequality and social exclusion in relation to vulnerabilities. These new challenges require a new approach that integrates governance, physical environment and infrastructure, social environment, economic environment, planning and resourcing for resilience, and gender equality and social inclusion (GESI). The objective of the study was to develop an integrated approach to strengthening urban resilience based on infrastructure, energy and health linkages, with a focus on GESI impacts. Drawing from lessons learned from various connected fields: climate-related disaster programs to designing infrastructure; power and energy systems to incorporate resilience and reliability; universal health coverage and health system strengthening; and the preliminary lessons drawn from the activities undertaken to control the Covid-19 pandemic, a Resilience Assessment Framework has been proposed. The framework is intended to be used to assess the current resilience maturity level of a city. It can also be applied to measure progress, at different time intervals, towards a prospective target maturity level.

AB  - The smart growth movement of the 1990s has seen many development and planning associations, state and local governments, and the Clinton administration encourage significant infill development to control sprawl and promote revitalization. Will the 123 million projected increase in population in the next 50 years be attracted to infill development or to outlying growth areas? A review of 22 major central cities shows that they captured only 5.2 percent of total new metropolitan housing permits over the decade: 2.2 percent of single-family pemits and 14.9 percent of multifamily permits. This analysis identifies the practical barriers to urban infill development, including land assembly and infrastructure costs, unwillingness to condemn, municipal social goal and regulatory policies, difficulty of finding developers, complexities of public-private partnerships, excessive risks, resistance from local residents, and stakeholder conflicts and political constraints. While supporting infill, smart growth advocates should focus primarily on encouraging higher-density, quality suburban and outlying growth.

AB  - Against the backdrop of the literature on technological innovation systems and innovation ecosystems, the paper analyses the sustainability transition in Smart Cities from an angle which we argue has not received enough attention so far, the central role of the consumer. The consumer is centrally positioned at the crossroads of Circular economy sectors making him a linchpin for sustainability transitions in which ICT figures prominently as a core technology and enabler of processes of consumption and production in industrial symbiosis. The recycling industry, the mobility sector and Green ICT - industries pertinent to the sustainability transition of Smart Cities - serve to illustrate and further flesh out this new role of the consumer. Current Smart City projects from around the globe are then mapped out with an interest in how the consumer (citizen) is involved in the process beyond being addressed as a service customer and beyond e-participation. The paper combines two hitherto separate but really closely intertwined areas: the technical sphere (industrial symbiosis and industry 4.0) and the management sphere (the Smart City) to reconcile the economic, ecological and social sustainability dimensions as envisioned in the industry 5.0 concept of the European Commission. Bringing the consumer to the forefront of sustainability analyses of Smart Cities can leverage the extent to which Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are actually met.

AB  - Public health risks such as obesity are influenced by numerous personal characteristics, but the local spatial structure such as an area's built environment can also affect the obesity rate. This study analyzes and discusses how a greenbelt plan as a tool of urban containment policy has an effect on obesity. This study conducted spatial econometric regression models with five factors (13 variables) including transportation, socio-economic, public health, region, and policy factors. The relationship was analyzed between two policy effects of a greenbelt (i.e., a green buffer zone) and obesity. The variables for two policy effects of greenbelt zones are the size of the greenbelt and the inside and outside areas of the greenbelt. The results indicate that the two variables have negative effects on obesity. The results of the analyses in this study have several policy implications. Greenbelts play a role as an urban growth management policy, leading to a reduced obesity rate due to the influence of the transportation mode. In addition, greenbelts can also reduce the obesity rate because they provide recreation spaces for people.

AB  - The city as a legal institution and as a space for the development of the person, family, education, commerce, among other social phenomena, has always been in constant evolution. We have traveled from the Greek polis to the medieval city now in the development and implementation of smart cities a new model of city characterized by the use of information technologies and communication as a means of transforming relations between the State and citizens, but which cannot leave behind culture as a necessary element of people's lives. In this paper we will review the role of culture and cultural heritage in the development and construction of smart cities as well as the Spanish legal framework which facilitates or promotes their incorporation into the new organizational models that have been launched.

AB  - Growth management is the branch of urban planning concerned with the timing and sequencing of land development and the policies designed to mitigate the more negative impacts of growth. These policies are often justified on the ground that rapid or poorly planned development causes ''quality of place'' to deteriorate, reducing both current welfare and the prospects for future growth (ie., ''killing the goose that laid the golden egg''), In this article, I evaluate the normative assumptions underlying this popular argument. I conclude that the ''golden egg'' argument makes an implicit analogy to resource economics and raises legitimate issues of sustainability and dynamic efficiency. Although an understanding of resource economics can provide more normative guidance than one typically finds in the urban planning literature, using these concepts to make policy is no easy task. Thus the golden egg argument remains subject to cynical manipulation by both pro- and antigrowth forces.

AB  - Along with the population growth and industrial revolution, migration from the countryside to the cities increased greatly and unplanned urbanization is brought out. This condition conclusions such as troubles faced for the use of resources, increasing environmental pollution, global warming. Unplanned growth of cities leads to serious destruction not only on the natural environment but also on the human nature. A successful sustainable urbanization is possible that both physical and social sustainability studies are accomplished in integration with each other. Cities have continually been destroying nature due to the lack of recycling technologies, unplanned settlement and desire for constructing houses to green areas, air pollution and unhealthy infrastructure. As a result of them sustainable urbanism focused on the term of eco-city. Eco-city is a city designing and application approach in which human, city and environment issues are handled in relation and interaction with each other. In eco-city design, some principles such as reducing the effect of cities on environment, the use of renewable energy sources, the lowest level of waste production and the use of renewable energy sources have been taken into consideration. The eco-city provides healthy abundance to its inhabitants without consuming renewable resources than it produces, without producing more waste than it can assimilate, and without being toxic to itself or neighboring ecosystems.

AB  - Cities contribute to over 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Cities are forced to engage in climate mitigation or adaptation measures due to climate change. Low carbon emissions are one of the most significant variables influencing sustainable urban development and combating climate change. Energy is essential and unavoidable for sustainability. Renewable energy will be critical to the world's decarbonized energy future. Ancient Iran was one of the first civilizations to address sustainability and climate change. There is a rich and sustainable urban planning heritage in Iran. Reviewing past experiences, technology, and knowledge is necessary to solve problems and move toward a better future. This manuscript discusses the various types of sustainability within this heritage and how we can utilize them to achieve sustainable development. These include Environmental Sustainability (Sustainable Water: Persian Qanat, Shushtar Historical Hydraulic System, Watermill, Cistern), (Sustainable Energy: Windcatcher, Windmill, Icehouse), (Sustainable Four Natural Elements: Persian Garden, Pasargadae, Persian Courtyard House), Political Sustainability (Sustainable Infrastructure, Information, and Communication: Trans-Iranian Railway, Chaparkhaneh, Persian Caravanserai), Economic Sustainability (Sustainable Economic Growth: Tabriz Historic Bazaar Complex), and Social Sustainability (Sustainable Security, Safety, and Resiliency: Underground City).

AB  - Worldwide, cities are implementing circular economy (CE) strategies to reduce the resources they consume and their environmental impact. However, the evidence of the intended and unintended social consequences of the transition to "circular cities" is scattered. The lack of a coherent overview of the evidence on the subject can hinder effective decision-making in policy and practice. This study examines the extent to which the current literature addresses the social impacts that a transition to a CE produces in cities. We used a methodological approach related to systematic mapping to collate the evidence published over the past decade globally. The study finds that social impacts have rarely been considered in studies of circular cities, and where they have been discussed, the scope has been quite limited, only covering employment (mostly of informal sector workers) and governance practices. This scoping review highlights the need to further analyse and integrate social impact considerations into decision-making connected to transitions towards circular cities.

AB  - CO2 emissions caused by urban residents' energy consumption arise from 1) transportation and 2) housing energy consumption. This energy consumption depends on the spatial population distribution of the city. The current study quantitatively examines the effectiveness of i) congestion tolls, ii) carbon tax, and iii) land use regulations on the social welfare and the reduction of urban CO2 emissions. Results show that the congestion tolls can increase the social welfare by about 85% of the increase in the first-best scenario, which is the best result among the three policies, and can reduce CO2 emissions from commuting and housing energy by about 22% and 3%, respectively. These results suggest that congestion tolling, which is primarily the Pigovian tax for congestion, not only internalizes congestion externalities, but also effectively reduces CO2 emissions through downsizing commuting distances and housing sizes. Nevertheless, we show that because any spending, including consumption of goods, generates CO2, how tax revenues are used is important for determining total CO2.

AB  - In a time of rapid climate change and environmental degradation, planning and building an ecologically sustainable environment have become imperative. In particular, urban settlements, as a densely populated built environment, are the center of attention. This study aims to build a clear and concise synthesis of sustainable urban development not only to serve as an essential reference for decision and policy makers, but also encourage more strategically organized sustainability efforts. The extensive similarities between environmental planning and a policy-making/decision-making/problem-solving process will be carefully examined to confirm the fundamental need to build a synthesis. Major global urban sustainability rankings/standards will be presented, discussed, and integrated to produce a holistic synthesis with ten themes and three dimensions. The study will assemble disparate information across time, space, and disciplines to guide and to facilitate sustainable urban development in which both environmental concerns and human wellbeing are addressed.

AB  - Municipal solid waste management (MSWM) is considered an important public health, economic and environmental concern, especially in developing countries. This paper introduces the situation of MSWM in La Paz (Bolivia) in 2016, and is based on the Wasteaware indicators and waste flow analysis, useful tools for classifying and comparing waste treatment and management plans among other countries. Taking into account the lack of technology in waste treatment and the presence of a developed informal sector, the paper analyses the main strengths and weak points for implementing a sustainable MSWM. The research conducted revealed that the MSWM of La Paz is not efficient with regard to collection, recycling (8%), financial sustainability, and equity of the service. At the same time, local Government and stakeholders are interested in implementing new MSWM methods for improving the current sanitary state of the city and many efforts were made over the last ten years. In general terms, La Paz could be considered as a good study area for developing plans for waste valorization, becoming an example for a low-middle income developing big city of Latin America. The study provided a few considerations about the affordability of the methodology applied and critically analyzed the case study proposed.

AB  - Large-scale urban expansion worldwide has exerted great impacts on cropland and its net primary productivity (NPP), which can affect whether food security and sustainable development goals will be met at global and local scales. Although important, the impacts at the global scale over the last 25 years remain unclear. Based on the latest long-term dynamic urban expansion data, this study analyzed global urban expansion and its impacts on cropland NPP from 1992 to 2016 at multiple scales. The results showed that the expansion of urban land occupied a total of 159 170 km(2)of cropland, accounting for 45.9% of the total expanded urban area. The cropland NPP decreased by 58.71 (56.52 similar to 59.81, 95% confidence interval) TgC as a result of urban expansion, which represents approximately 0.42% (0.40% similar to 0.43%) of the multiyear average of total cropland NPP from 2000 to 2015. If the cropland NPP losses were converted to the grain production (i.e. 1.44 x 10(7)tons), it is equivalent to the minimum annual food intake demands for at least 36 million people. More importantly, urban expansion is exacerbating the risk of food security in developing countries in Asia and Africa, such as China, Vietnam and Egypt. In the future, these countries should balance urban expansion with cropland protection by strictly restricting the occupation of cropland and encouraging smart urban growth.

AB  - Increasingly dense cities have substituted natural and agricultural spaces for urban sprawl, and inhabitants have expressed their discomfort. As a result of this finding, the first questions about cities were brought up in 1950 to analyze sustainable development and global warming as fundamental issues for research in order to improve the urban environment and make cities more sustainable and livable. The conclusions are alarming and, therefore, new greening policies are emerging, but how to achieve greening in dense cities? What kind of nature? Where? For whom? This article intends to inventory, observe, and assess these large projects to tackle this problem. The method is based on literature and concept analyses and fieldwork to understand the evolution of policies, projects, and challenges since the 1950s. We address the concepts of green belts, green infrastructures, green and blue frames, and linear parks initially designed in the heart of metropolises. Finally, we review recent projects of our interest, mainly two.

AB  - Urban density is central to pressing questions concerning low-carbon lifestyles, affordable housing and global land use patterns. However, for many densifying cities, problems of inequality, climate emissions and social sustainability often remain unsolved or exaggerated. Adopting a relational perspective, this paper explores the politics of urban densification in Oslo, Norway. Arguing that urban density is assembled as particular political projects, the paper seeks to understand the achievements urban densification projects bring together, from housing policy to environmental policy, property schemes and financial strategies. Based on a qualitative study of urban densification strategies and projects in Oslo, the paper develops a typology of hegemonic and counterhegemonic urban density discourses and contributes to a discussion of how economically, socially and environmentally different kinds of urban densities may be assembled.

AB  - Energy efficiency and the environmental impact of buildings are considered key strategic goals in the EU. However, the resulting increase in energy efficiency of buildings is shifting the environmental burden from the operational to other building life cycle stages. Thus, the presented study investigates the association between the total energy needs and embodied global warming potential (GWP) of building materials on 496,800 building models. These models were parametrically defined through variations of eight different energy-efficiency passive design measures. The results demonstrated that structure material choice significantly determines the total buildings' embodied GWP. Moreover, decreasing U values below 0.15 W/m(2)K is questionable as these buildings resulted in a slight reduction of total energy need but a disproportional increase in embodied GWP. Conclusions indicate that passive building energy efficiency measures should be evaluated from both operational and embodied environmental impacts, particularly if the future decarbonization of the energy mix is also considered.

AB  - Urban ecosystems, and the services they provide, are a key focus of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, specifically SDG 11, which emphasizes making cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. Green infrastructure (GI) is crucial in enhancing citizens' quality of life and achieving this goal and it can be defined as a strategically planned network of natural and semi-natural areas designed to deliver a range of ecosystem services (ESs). These infrastructures improve ecosystem functioning, protect biodiversity, promote health, support sustainable land and water management, and boost the local green economy. This paper explores the scientific literature on GI and their ESs in cities using bibliometric science. By combining the keywords "Green Infrastructures", "Ecosystem Services", and "Cities" with VOSviewer software (1.6.20 version), we analyzed trends over time. Results show growing attention to these topics, emphasizing human well-being, urban resilience, and sustainability. The study also highlights that focusing exclusively on either "Green Infrastructure in Cities" or "Ecosystem Services in Cities" leads to fragmented insights. A more integrated examination of these three domains offers a holistic view and underscores the importance of considering ecosystem disservices. The study further identifies key research directions, including the need for a comprehensive evaluation of diverse GI types, especially those that are under-researched, such as green roofs, sports areas, and wetlands, and the underexplored role of cultural ecosystem services. Additionally, future research should consider both the benefits and disservices of GI to support better urban planning decisions. Finally, integrating biophysical, social, and economic values of ESs is critical for providing more holistic insights and enhancing sustainable urban development. The novelty of this paper lies in its integrated, holistic approach to examining GI and ESs in urban areas, with a focus on ecosystem disservices, insufficient attention to specific GI types, and the role of cultural ecosystem services-each contributing to the creation of more resilient and sustainable cities.

AB  - Urban growth causes numerous threats to human well-being, as a consequence of the loss and degradation of urban and peri-urban green spaces. This research aims to investigate the possible role of green infrastructures (GIs), as providers of ecosystem services, in enhancing urban well-being in the 116 Italian provincial capital cities. The analysis has been based on the conceptual model proposed by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) (2005) to explain how the four categories of ecosystem services (supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural) and the components of human well-being are interrelated. In order to perform the assessment, the most suitable indicators of social capital and green infrastructures have been identified from the panel of indices and indicators provided by national official statistics. The corresponding analysis has highlighted that northern Italian cities are characterized by simple but well-managed green infrastructures and wooded areas, with the highest level of social cohesion and inclusion associated with a high value of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. The southern part of the country is characterized mainly by "Historical greens" and high levels of health and social security but low levels of income, social inclusion and cohesion. This research represents a first attempt to link the different typologies of green infrastructures with the provision of ecosystem services. Given the recognized contribution of GIs in preserving natural habitats in an urban context, the SLOSS (single large or several small) debate, typically applied for conservation purposes, could also be appropriate for GIs. Therefore, it could be necessary to investigate whether fewer large nature preserves (large urban parks), or a patchwork of smaller green areas can better enhance human well-being in an urban context.

AB  - The social value of the circular economy (CE) has only been recently explored in the literature. To understand the social implications of the implementation of the CE, a semi-systematic literature review was completed evalu-ating the variables of equity, diversity, collaboration, quality of life, maturity, and governance as derived from a capabilities approach. At a societal level, this article explores the main demands and contributions of the CE to society and identifies the inconsistencies in the literature in assessing the CE as a strategy for development, counterposing views of the CE's contribution to the socioeconomic system. Furthermore, the analysis proposes a set of socioeconomic strategies that can aid a CE implementation. We expand the 'rethink' tactic of the 9Rs (Refuse, Rethink, Reduce, Reuse, Repair, Refurbish, Remanufacture, Repurpose, Recycle and Recover) to also rethinking: the economic model, discourse, management strategies, ownership, business models, care work and value chains as well as remembering, reorganizing, and revitalizing. Furthermore, we include nuances to the 9Rs, adding regeneration. The qualitative assessment combined with a topic model offered specific areas where the social dimensions can be prioritized; these include food systems, the built environment with localized urban sharing, value chains, bioeconomy and mitigating the environmental impact of industries such as fashion and construction.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine social sustainability effectiveness of eco-cities through the case of Masdar City's strategy for urban sustainability in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Design/methodology/approach - Using a case study approach, the paper is an exploratory, qualitative analysis, which investigates the social, environmental and economic performance of Masdar City, a purported carbon-neutral, zero-waste urban development. Findings - Though Masdar City substantively contributes to innovation in sustainable urban development within environmental and economic contexts and has been effective in capital circulation in green technology markets, the impetus as a commercially driven enterprise is most evident. Successful sustainable urban development requires greater consideration for the social imperative. Practical implications - Eco-citymega-projects, such as Masdar City, have the potential to fuse achievements in innovation, technology and economic enterprise with the social imperative of functional urban habitats. Originality/value - Eco-cities are of increasing interest given the growing need for sustainable, energy-efficient living. This paper contributes through a novel case study, exploring how the concept of the eco-city has been developed and understood in the Masdar City context and discusses successes and deficits in its strategic implementation.

AB  - Little is known about relationships between attributes of land use plans and sociodemographic variations in physical activity (PA). This study evaluates associations between policy-relevant plan attributes, sociodemographic factors, and PA in North Carolina. Results suggest that land use plans that included non-automobile transportation improvements and more comprehensive policies to guide development were positively associated with both leisure and transportation-related PA. However, residents of counties with lower-income levels and higher proportions of non-white residents were less likely to have attributes supportive of PA included in their plans. Implications for transdisciplinary collaboration with respect to reducing health disparities are discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Inequalities in the exposure to environmental burdens and access to environmental benefits are an environmental justice concern for urban and regional environmental planning. Recent studies have assessed the exposure of different populations to a combination of environmental hazards through GIS-based Cumulative Environmental Impact Assessments (CEIA). The contribution of this study is the development of a CEIA, which incorporates the distance-based impact of transportation, the cumulative impact of environmental hazards, and access to environmental benefits for Santa Clara County (SCC), a highly diverse and rapidly developing region also known as 'Silicon Valley'. Our results show that social vulnerability, cumulative environmental hazards, and environmental benefits exhibit distinct spatial patterns in SCC. High environmental hazard values are found along freeway and railroad corridors with substantial industrial legacies, while environmental benefit scores are generally higher in the suburban periphery. Correlations indicate that socially vulnerable populations in SCC are predominantly hispanic and are more likely to be exposed to environmental hazards, while white and wealthier populations are more likely to have access to environmental benefits. The results from this study may serve to develop community-based initiatives for neighborhood improvement and environmental-justice-based regional planning and public health policy reform.

AB  - In the context of leisure travel in sport, the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals to promote public health and combat climate change may be addressed simultaneously. This study investigates football spectators’ carbon footprint that is generated from traveling to the stadium. It also examines the effects of stadium travel and everyday pro-environmental behavior on spectators’ subjective well-being. The study uses data that were gathered from an online survey in Germany in 2021 (n = 1605). For a detailed carbon footprint assessment, spectators were allowed to indicate multiple transportation means if they switched them during their stadium journey. Seemingly unrelated regression models were calculated to examine the effect of transportation behavior (i.e., stadium travel) and everyday recycling, consumption, and energy-saving behavior on life satisfaction and happiness. Traveling to a home game caused an average carbon footprint of 7.79 kg CO2-e per spectator, or 190.4 tons CO2-e for all home game spectators. Regression results showed that sustainable consumption increased both well-being measures while recycling behavior only positively contributed to happiness. Stadium travel and energy-saving behavior showed no significant effect. These findings implicate that achieving both sustainable development goals can go hand in hand in some contexts of pro-environmental behavior, but not in all dimensions.

AB  - Now is the time to refocus efforts in urban research and design. A changing climate and extreme weather events are presenting unique challenges to urban systems around the world. These challenges illuminate the social barriers that accompany disruptive events such as resource inequities and injustices. In this perspective, we provide three research priorities for just and sustainable urban systems that help to address these matters. The three research priorities are: (1) social equity and justice, (2) circularity, and (3) digital twins. Conceptual context and future research directions are provided for each. For social equity and justice, the future directions are mandatory equity analysis and inclusionary practices, understanding and reconciling historical injustices, and intentional integration with diverse community stakeholders. For circularity applications, they are better metrics for integration, more robust evaluation frameworks, and dynamic modeling at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Future directions for digital twins include developing principles to reduce complexity, integrating model and system components, and reducing barriers to data access. These research priorities are core to meeting several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (i.e., 1-No Poverty, 8-Decent Work and Economic Growth, 10-Reduced Inequalities, and 11-Sustainable Cities and Communities). Useful social and technical matters are discussed throughout, where we highlight the importance of prioritizing localized research efforts, provide guidance for community-engaged research and co-development practices, and explain how these priorities interact to align with the evolving field of industrial ecology.

AB  - Two concepts that provide new directions for public policy, environmental justice and sustainability, are both highly contested. Each has tremendous potential to effect long-lasting change. Despite the historically different origins of these two concepts and their attendant movements, there exists an area of theoretical compatibility between them. This conceptual overlap is a critical nexus for a broad social movement to create livable, sustainable communities for all people in the future. The goal of this article is to illustrate the nexus in the United States. The authors do this by presenting a range of local or regionally based practical models in five areas of common concern to both environmental justice and sustainability: land use planning, solid waste, toxic chemical use, residential energy use, and transportation. These models address both environmental justice principles while working toward greater sustainability in urbanized areas.

AB  - As a global financial center and one of the world's first-tier cities, Hong Kong is committed to sustainable development and it expects to become the most sustainable city in Asia. With this in mind, this paper evaluates the level of sustainable development in Hong Kong considering the factors of ecological footprint, biocapacity, and the human development index (HDI) from 1995 to 2016, in order to make policy recommendations for transforming Hong Kong into a more sustainable city. Between 1995 and 2016, a period during which the HDI rose, the per capita ecological footprint of Hong Kong increased from 4.842 gha to 6.223 gha. Moreover, fossil energy consumption had a crucial impact on the city's ecological footprint, whereas the biocapacity of Hong Kong declined gradually. By contrast, Singapore, a city-state with an area similar to Hong Kong's, presented the opposite situation-the HDI increased while the ecological footprint decreased. We performed a further comparative analysis and a SWOT analysis of Singapore and Hong Kong to elaborate on how to decouple the large ecological footprint from human society development. Concluding that the focus must be on energy consumption, reduction of the human activities' negative impacts on marine environment, citizens and government, we provide policy suggestions for transforming toward a "high HDI and low footprint" sustainable development society in Hong Kong.

AB  - Getting to net-zero-carbon cities while advancing well-being (W), health (H), social equity (E), and climate resilience (R) (referred to as the WHER outcomes) is critical for local and global sustainability. However, science is nascent on the linkages between zero-carbon pathways and WHER outcomes. This article presents a transboundary urban metabolism framework, rooted in seven key infrastructure and food provisioning systems, to connect urban decarbonization strategies with WHER outcomes. Applying the framework along with a literature review, we find the evidence for cobeneficial decarbonization to be strong for health; limited for well-being; uncertain for resilience; and requiring intentional design to advance equity, including distributional, procedural, and recognitional aspects. We describe the evidence base, identify key knowledge gaps, and delineate broad parameters of a new urban nexus science to enable zero-carbon urban transitions with WHER co-benefits. We highlight the need for fine-scale data encompassing all seven sectors across scales, along with multiple and multiscale climate risks, accompanied by next-generation multisector, multiscale, multioutcome nexus models.

AB  - Urbanisation has increased the need for sustainable urban development by positioning smart cities as critical frameworks for addressing environmental, economic, and social challenges. This study evaluates the sustainability strategies of three leading smart cities Zurich, Oslo, and Copenhagen by examining their environmental footprint, energy consumption, waste management, and air quality. The study uses a PRISMA-based systematic literature review to put together evidence from peer-reviewed articles published between 2017 and 2024. The Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) was used to assess the quality of the articles. The study reveals that smart mobility and waste-to-energy systems drive Zurich's strengths in urban densification and public transportation, Oslo's leadership in renewable energy and electric mobility, and Copenhagen's ambitious carbon-neutral initiatives. Despite these achievements, challenges such as high implementation costs, slow technological adoption, and social equity issues persist, emphasising the complexity of achieving inclusive and sustainable urban evolution. To address these challenges, this study recommends increasing public participation through inclusive urban planning and digital platforms, strengthening policy frameworks, and funding for sustainability projects, and investing in data collection technologies to monitor real-time environmental impacts. Furthermore, fostering cross-city collaboration and addressing energy consumption challenges associated with AI and IoT are essential for scaling successful models globally. These insights offer actionable guidance for policymakers and urban planners to improve sustainability strategies and ensure long-term benefits.

AB  - The global mainstreaming of urban sustainability policy, since the early 2000s, points to a new phenomenon: the 'ubiquitous eco-city'. Its key features - based on the analysis of a census of 178 initiatives - include: the significant, global proliferation of eco-city initiatives; increased international knowledge transfer activities involving both public and private actors; the centrality of 'carbon discourse' guiding concepts, policy and practice; the marrying of 'green' with 'smart' technological systems; and a focus on achieving environmental innovation through economic growth. Among the implications is the need to moderate the 'ubiquitous eco-city' paradigm with strong local contextualisation and social sustainability measures.

AB  - In 2008, Toronto's City Council agreed to support the Tower Renewal Project, an ambitious proposal to renew over 1,000 aging concrete high-rise apartment buildings constructed largely between the 1960s and 1980s in socially and economically marginalized areas across Toronto, Canada. Over 500,000 residents live in these comparatively affordable high-rise buildings. These structures now require significant environmental upgrades to conserve energy and reduce carbon emissions. In addition to proposing structural retrofits, the Tower Renewal Project is concerned with addressing environmental justice issues in high-rise neighborhoods such as the spatial organization of inequalities, transportation concerns, health inequalities, problems with existing zoning bylaws, and public participation. Despite the challenges to naming, framing, and applying the concept of environmental justice in Canada, this article argues that the Tower Renewal Project addresses environmental justice concerns and politics unique to the Canadian urban context, and more specifically, to Toronto.

AB  - Intensification and poor management of industrial and urbanization activities increasingly threaten the health of the urban population. Taking into account the ecosystems and biodiversity into urban planning are among the key aspects of urban sustainable development. In the literature, key knowledge gaps remain for improving governance for urban sustainability and resilience. This paper examines and elaborates the challenges the cities, particularly in developing countries, face with regard to urban sustainable development. It considers the capital of Macedonia, Skopje, as a city where a chain of unsustainable policies during the last decade resulted in excessive air pollution and harm to the public health and to the economy. The analysis shows that determining appropriate governance responsive to sustainable urban development is a major challenge that developing cities face today. The article argues that there are trade-offs to be made between multilevel policy networks and a hierarchical structure, short-term and long-term perspective, human capacities of professionals and elected officials, political and community interests, community participation, and government control.

AB  - Accelerating urbanization has positioned cities as epicenters of water-energy-food (WEF) demand growth, yet their resource consumption patterns persistently exceed planetary boundaries. Resolving this dual challenge requires fundamentally rethinking cities' capacity to operate within ecological supply limits while ensuring basic human needs. We implement a city-scale adaptation of the doughnut framework, constructing a safe and just space (SJS) assessment model that quantifies ecosystem services (ESs) as linkages between WEF demands and ecological boundaries. Our analysis of 336 Chinese cities reveals spatial disparities: 91 % of cities in China can operate within their SJS for water provisioning, while only 25 % maintain current carbon emissions below ecological ceilings. Additionally, 28 % of cities simultaneously fulfill the SJS requirements for phosphorus purification. Regarding land use, 69 % can operate within the SJS, but most cities are approaching or already at verge of the biophysical boundary. In general, only 13 % of cities can adequately meet social demands within the boundaries of all four ESs. Random forest algorithm further identified social variables (e.g., population) and economic variables (e.g., industrial growth and gross regional domestic product) as dominant drivers of SJS performance. These findings underscore the imperative for adaptive governance that coordinates ES management through the SJS-ESs-WEF nexus, offering actionable pathways to align urban development with ecosystem stability and social justice imperatives.

AB  - Travel can affect land use just as land use affects travel behaviour of people. Low-cost travel, especially resulting from transportation improvements since the nineteenth century, has resulted in long-distance travel and urban sprawl, bringing along negative aspects such as traffic congestion and air pollution, but also reductions in biodiversity and public health. In order to try to partly reverse this process, the supply of infrastructure and public transportation can no longer follow the demand of transportation; the supply has to steer the demand. Infrastructure and high-quality public transportation should be clustered in and between large and regional cities. Increasing travel costs for car use (e.g., road pricing) can positively affect travel distances and travel mode choice, but also long-term decisions such as the residential location choice, stimulating compact, mixed-use developments. In this paper, we focus on Flanders, Belgium, a region where mobility policies stimulated long-distance travel and limited land use regulations did not hinder urban sprawl. Increasing travel costs combined with a more active spatial planning policy and a stronger cooperation between mobility policy and spatial planning can help to decrease car use and urban sprawl, but also change the way in which people perceive travel.

AB  - Residential solar photovoltaics (PV) are important for a rapid decarbonization strategy. To chart an equitable energy transition, researchers have measured inequalities in residential PV adoption and identified factors that drive group disparities. We know little, however, about people's experiences after installing solar. Electricity generation differences among PV systems can be substantial and may contribute to inequitable outcomes even as adoption disparities wane. Here we use data measuring actual monthly generation for over 26,000 PV systems installed in Connecticut to identify significant disparities in system output by neighbourhood income and race. We show that the choice of financing model (purchase or leasing) partly explains the observed disparities. We also find that system generation varies significantly across installers, highlighting that firm behaviour contributes to inequitable outcomes. These findings underscore the importance of measuring the quality and the quantity of renewable energy projects to ensure an equitable energy transition.

AB  - The preservation of biodiversity, city-dwellers' quality of life and equality are major issues in promoting sustainable cities. We chose to work at the built-up and much-valued heart of an agglomeration: Paris. We attempt to verify whether public semi-natural spaces with spontaneous vegetation and green frames provide ecosystem services to city-dwellers in an equitable way, and what is the role played by urban landscapes in this relation. Based upon existing datasets, a spatial and statistical analysis of relationships between public semi-natural spaces, urban landscapes and socioeconomic profiles of households was carried out. We compare their spatial patterns, which vary considerably. Mean income per vegetal and landscape cluster and correlations between income, ecological parameters and building density show complex and non-linear relationships. According to Multiple Correspondence Analysis, clusters of public semi-natural spaces. floristic richness and ecological diversity are associated with specific household socioeconomic profiles and landscape design. In the western built-up Haussmann districts inhabited by well-off households, public semi natural spaces provide low ecosystem services. Conversely, in the eastern and peripheral quarters where lower-income households live, public semi-natural spaces provide higher ecosystem services. It is not only well-off households which benefit from being close to urban parks and waterways. Blue and green frames cross districts inhabited by different household profiles. The implications of such results on inequalities between city-dwellers depends whether the presence of public semi-natural spaces actually improves their quality of life. These results are highly significant at a time when urban planners are putting the city's Biodiversity Plan in place. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Urban containment policies attempt to manage the location, character, and timing of growth to support a variety of goals such as compact development, preservation of greenspace, and efficient use of infrastructure. Despite prior research evaluating the effects of urban containment policies on land use, housing, and transportation outcomes, the public health implications of these policies remain unexplored. This ecologic study examines relationships among urban containment policies, state adoption of growthmanagement legislation, and population levels of leisure and transportation-related physical activity in 63 large metropolitan statistical areas from 1990 to 2002. Methods: Multiple data sources were combined, including surveys of urban containment policies, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, the U.S. Census of Population, the National Resources Inventory, and the Texas Transportation Institute Urban Mobility Study. Mixed models were used to examine whether urban containment policies and state adoption of growth-management legislation were associated with population levels of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) and walking/bicycling to work over time. Results: Strong urban containment policies were associated with higher population levels of LTPA and walking/bicycling to work during the study period. Additionally, residents of states with legislation mandating urban growth boundaries reported significantly more minutes of LTPA/week compared to residents of states without such policies. Weak urban containment policies showed inconsistent relationships with physical activity. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence that strong urban containment policies are associated with higher population levels of LTPA and active commuting. Future research should examine potential synergies among state, metropolitan, and local policy processes that may strengthen these relationships.

AB  - This article reviews the current status of research on urban green and blue infrastructure (GBI) in developing countries. We critically analyzed a total of 283 papers addressing urban GBI in selected developing countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), published between 2015 and 2019. The review aimed to a) analyze publication trends and typologies of urban GBI; b) identify innovative problem-solving measures using urban GBI, and c) understand priorities, differences and similarities in the deployment of urban GBI between the regions. The article identifies a growing interest in the urban GBI concept in the Global South, with a focus on local sustainable development. Urban GBI aims to address issues of urban greenery, land use policies, food security and poverty alleviation. There is a large variation in the number of articles across regions, with Asia, and particularly China, as the subject having a much larger number of publications when compared to LAC and Africa. We found that the focus of research topics varied between regions, reflecting regional development needs, so that urban agriculture research predominated in Africa, and green spaces and parks in Asia and LAC. GBI is still not implemented as a low-impact development or innovative strategy, except in China, where researchers have examined several cases of systemic GBI use for addressing urban issues. More recently, studies began exploring the linkages between nature and cities in light of global environmental issues such as biodiversity loss and climate change. We conclude with recommendations to further examine empirical evidence of urban GBI deployment and its outcomes in the Global South, that could contribute toward conceptualizing natural resource management in a multi-scalar, multi-dimensional, and multidisciplinary framework.

AB  - Shenzhen is a city that is highly representative of China's rapid urbanization process. As the city rapidly expands, there are enormous challenges to the sustainable use of land resources. This paper introduces the evolution of urban land expansion and the sustainable land use policy of the Shenzhen Government since 2005. The policy covers the reduction in rural-to-urban land conversion, the delineation of urban growth boundaries, arable land reclamation and the establishment of farmland protection areas, urban redevelopment, and the investigation and prosecution of illegal construction. This paper considers the aspects of urbanization and land management systems that are unique to China. The current top-down indicative and mandatory mode of control, which relies on the central government, has very limited effects. Good results were achieved in Shenzhen for the following elements: governmental self-restraint, governmental identity change, and policy innovation. Shenzhen's sustainable land use practices can provide a reference for other cities in China.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NBS) harness ecosystem services for urban enhancement, promoting biodiversity, habitat creation, and water management while improving human well-being. However, decision-making often favours specific NBS designs, leading to uneven benefits distribution. Whereas human-centric NBS design relies on convenience, financial sustainability, historical aspects, and amenity increase through NBS technical solutions, flora- and fauna-centric (or eco-centric) design targets spatial connectedness of blue-green spaces, increase in species richness, and habitat within urban centres. Both approaches can shape the urban biodiversity landscape, yet; they often clash around planning priorities. Recent advances in AI offer potential for AI-centric urban planning, though its role remains unclear. This study examines the interplay between biodiversity and NBS planning across human-, eco-, and AI-centric domains, aiming for balanced urban outcomes. We blended narrative, integrative, and systematic literature review and propose future steps for more balanced NBS development. The findings of this work suggest that AI presents an opportunity for a more balanced NBS design through its applications in climate change prediction, water management, and project visualisation. Incorporating AI into urban planning tools can expedite modelling process, improve stakeholder communication, and enhance project outcomes visualisation. By integrating human, eco, and AI-centric approaches, urban planners can foster resilience and sustainability in NBS implementation, ensuring equitable distribution of benefits across urban landscapes.

AB  - The present work explores the relationship between an urban road with both, socio-metabolic processes and natural systems patterns. The premise is that roads have a decisive impact on energy, material flows and connectivity between biological structures. Therefore, urban metabolism - Social and natural processes measured out of energy use, material flows and land use - becomes the appropriate instrument to assess and analyze the functionality of the different components operating in artificial and natural systems. The case study traces the metabolic behaviors that result from the cross of Juan Ponce de Leon Avenue through the water system composed by the estuary of Martin Pena and Rio Piedras River. A theoretical framework based on social equity, economy, and ecology is being applied in data collection and analysis. Parametric methodologies and GIS information are used to describe the structural and functional properties of both natural and urban systems. The collected data enable the understanding that the simultaneous loss of energy efficiency and land-use efficiency from the mid-20th century to the present affects the resilience of the area. Consequently, this exploration demonstrates the importance of urban metabolism in maintaining the ecological quality of natural systems. As a result, it proposes an urban metabolism strategy to develop more sustainable urban schemes for the systems composed of urban roads and natural ecosystems. The organized complexity of the water system, necessary to host biodiversity and fundamental ecological processes, cannot be guaranteed if the urban metabolism is not taken into account.

AB  - Urban planners in the Caribbean have long advocated for a resolution of conflicts between built development and the environment. They have grappled with challenges of small geographic size, an increasingly urbanised landscape and the need to facilitate urban centres as engines of economic development and as the loci of prosperity. This article investigates the urban planning community's perspective with respect to the drivers of unsustainable urbanisation and provides a conceptual framework for urban planning to attain urban sustainability in a small island developing state context. Trinidad is used as a case study. The research found that urbanisation has been inadequately regulated despite a plethora of legislation, urban plans and policies, and that the political will to achieve urban sustainability is lacking. This has resulted in ecosystem damage, economic losses and the undermining of human well-being. The article concludes that urban planning needs a conceptual framework to move centre stage and a steadfast political will is paramount in achieving urban sustainability in the Caribbean.

AB  - Sustainable energy use and management are key to improving human well-being, while rapid urbanization intersecting with economic development makes it challenging. Extensive cross-national analyses on this topic can inform the global agenda; however, far fewer subnational explorations consider the impact of urbanization in moderating the relationships between energy resource use, greenhouse gas emissions, socio-economic and human development. Therefore, this research analyzed Chinese subnational data from 2000 to 2019 to reveal the dynamic relationship between energy use and objective human well-being and explored how urbanization moderated the transitional linkages from energy use to economic development to human need satisfiers and to human well-being. This research found a diminishing return from energy use (both primary energy extraction and final energy use) to the Human Development Index (HDI) from 2000 to 2019. Moreover, in later years, there was neither a linear correlation nor a log-linear relationship between energy use and HDI at the subnational level. In contrast, HDI was consistently strongly correlated with GDP per capita and household income at the subnational level in China over time. Two distinct energy-GDP pathways, i.e., high energy use-low GDP and low energy use-high GDP, were observed at the subnational level, which explained why the log-linear relationship between HDI and energy use/GHGs diminished over time. Urbanization level had a significant moderating impact on the linkages between human need satisfiers and HDI, as well as life expectancy. Subnational policies should prioritize different human need satisfiers in different urbanization periods.

AB  - With the implementation of sustainable development objectives in developing countries, urban planning, land use regulation, and urban mobility policies are expected to help reduce inequalities in access to urban facilities. Urban transport policies are also expected to encourage travel by non-motorised modes and public transport. These are considered to be the sustainable modes of urban transport. In this paper, we investigate how inequality of urban facilities impacts trips made by sustainable modes in the city of Santiago de Chile. We use a Poisson regression model and its geographical extension, the geographically weighted Poisson regression model (GWPR). The results suggest that the inequality of urban facilities impacts trips made by sustainable modes. The variables with the highest relevance are the spatial distribution of mixed land use, the spatial distribution of urban services related to transport infrastructure, primary and secondary education, as well as the spatial distribution of demographic variables related to people’s life cycle.

AB  - Policy approaches to the global energy transition often focus on technology-based solutions while ignoring challenges of overall energy demand. A sufficiency-first approach aims to limit superfluous consumption while achieving wellbeing for all. This study focuses on US built environment mechanisms of sufficiency under urban land-use policy. The historical context of US exclusionary and car-oriented planning is reviewed with an order- of-magnitude assessment of the effects on greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE). Using national vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) data derived from mobile device locations (Replica) and validated here with federal data, a hypothetical scenario explores the potential for state urban land-use reforms to enable energy sufficiency. Tenth percentile-VMT (per capita) neighborhoods are defined by state: in 47 states, the typical such neighborhood has less than 33% of its housing units in structures larger than four units. Assuming each state redresses its housing shortage while matching this VMT, 31 Mt CO(2)e (direct GHGE) and about 38 Mt CO(2)e (indirect and life-cycle GHGE) would be avoided in 2033. Texas, California, and Florida have the largest absolute emissions reduction opportunity. Urban land-use reforms comprise a logical starting point for a US sufficiency agenda. Key priorities for research, data collection, and technology and policy innovation are proposed.

AB  - Solid waste recycling in developing countries has been largely relying on the informal recycling sector which intelligently uses the tacit knowledge within the hierarchical network of labor division to capture the value from the geographically uneven distribution of waste generation and demands on secondary materials. Previous studies on solid waste recycling mainly have a material-centric view on economic value. In this paper, an entropy-weighted recyclability index (EWRI) is developed to quantify the recyclability of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) in China at the prefectural city level by integrating the road transportation density and regional recycling capability into the categories of waste physical components regarding the cost to deliver the waste from generating sources to the conversion sites for recycling. The result confirms the existence of an east-west gradient regional disparity in recyclability of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) among cities for the recyclable components. The 339 prefectural cities were classified into 4 grades, namely "best, good, normal, and difficult" for the recyclability of local MSW with guidelines for planning of regional recycling infrastructure, respectively. In conclusion, general guidelines for the building of wise-waste city infrastructure to fit the local context in developing countries is advised.

AB  - Urban landscape has faced with substantial social, economic and environmental challenges due to uncontrolled growth of cities and regions during the past century. The unprecedented demographic growth and the consequent changes in the landscape give rise to extensive sustainability challenges such as ecosystem degradation, loss of agricultural and natural land resources, and shortage or unequal distribution of water resources and associated infrastructure. Cities and urban regions can be considered as one of the key sources of energy resources consumption and significant contributors to greenhouse gases emissions due to inefficiency of built environment and transportation activities. Energy consumption reduction and the use of renewable energy sources are recognized as governmental priorities in the context of green economy and sustainable development. In the recent decades, research and policy analysis are mainly centered on reduction of energy consumption and mitigation of environmental degradation. However, the literature on socio-economic and spatial determinants of non-renewable energy consumption in the European Union (EU) countries is scarce. The literature focuses on either non-spatial determinants of energy consumption or spatial determinants were considered at the country level and there are few studies utilizing the regions as the unit of analysis. Therefore, the study aims at quantifying and analyzing the spatial determinants of non-renewable residential energy consumption at the NUTS3 (nomenclature of territorial units for statistics) regional level in the EU countries (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/history) for a better understanding of the determinants of energy consumption and its policy implications.

AB  - Cities represent unique spaces for climate mitigation where wide-ranging action to reduce emissions meets ambition and collaboration. This research work distils climate neutrality narratives for 362 cities that expressed interest in the European Mission on 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities and focuses on the 112 cities selected to spearhead the process of reaching climate neutrality by 2030 (representing a mitigation potential of 318.3 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions). The method involves steps that profile the characteristics of these cities, enunciate cross-cutting patterns in cities' visions by thematic groupings, and compare 14 contextual factors with 77 possible main barriers. There are both similarities and differences among the results as a basis for learning together and certain barriers can be relatively more dominant in some thematic groupings, such as fragmentation of responsibilities. As a synthesis of the main findings, the original analyses are used to derive and prioritise nine high-level recommendations based on the cities' visions, contextual factors, and expected main barriers. Opportunities for mobilising transformative change relate to transforming siloed into integrated approaches, inclusive climate governance and collaborations, innovative financing, welfare and just transition as well as planning, implementation, and policy coherence. The advances provide pioneering steps for stimulating co-learning processes among Mission Cities and beyond to support the transition to climate neutrality and open up opportunities to progress together in climate action while producing impact with global reach.

AB  - Ongoing urbanization leads to problems such as densification, loss of biodiversity, and social injustice in cities. For increasing urban populations, green???blue infrastructure (GBI) is an important element in compact cities contributing to human health, well-being, and the provision of important ecosystem services. We analyzed responses from two open-ended questions about visions, ideas, and topics for the development and management of GBI important for citizens of the city of Leipzig, Germany. The questions were part of an online survey accompanying the development of the local GBI planning strategy: Master Plan Green. The strategy is focusing on five guiding themes that are leading local and global debates about sustainable and resilient cities: biodiversity, climate adaptation, environmental justice, health, and sustainable mobility. We categorize citizens' ideas and suggestions, summarize frequent problems and conflicts, and link ideas and visions to the five guiding themes. As the last step, we discuss citizens' suggestions in order to minimize conflicts in GBI and to identify deficits in present local planning. Major problems and conflicts that were addressed by respondents relate to quality, usability, other users, activities, and safety and security of GBI. Numerous suggestions aimed to tackle these problems, for example, by designating separate use areas, adding naturalness, improving maintenance, and enhancing facilities. A range of ideas and suggestions were based on diverging expectations underpinning the challenge of matching heterogeneous demands of GBI users in an equitable fashion. Linking these suggestions to the five guiding themes reveals that most ideas are covered by one or several guiding themes and are considered in local planning strategies. However, findings also demonstrate that increasing the quantity of Leipzig's GBI is a central request from respondents. Sociocultural and economic aspects as well as conflicting demands among citizens should further be central to GBI planning to avoid injustice and achieve sustainability objectives. This analysis gives insights into opinions and visions of citizens regarding the development of the city's GBI network and thus substantiates major strategic and planning themes leading global and local urban strategies toward sustainable cities. Considering specific suggestions and GBI deficits that bother citizens on a local level, offers the opportunity to improve the social and ecological resilience of GBI.

AB  - In the context of accelerating urbanisation, cities must ensure a viable economy, social well-being, and a healthy environment. Transport is one of the key conditions for economic development and meeting the needs of countries, regions, and cities. However, transport must meet not only the physiological but also the social needs of society, one of which is environmental security. Urban transport accounts for around 40% of CO2 emissions and 70% of other pollutants from road transport. Thus, one of the most difficult issues for any city to address when building bypasses is the growing number of cars in the city, traffic congestion, and the reduction of all greenhouse gas emissions. The documents adopted in July 2020 aim to revitalise the EU’s economy by moving towards a green economy and sustainability. In addition to the systematic and comparative analysis of concepts published in the scientific literature, the article also presents an analysis of the concepts of the sustainable city and sustainable transport, as well as a study of the social impact of bypasses and the assessment of the security of the social environment in the Baltic capitals. The aim of the article is to assess the impact of the growing number of vehicles on the security of the city’s social environment. Research results show that the number of pollutants and a direct dependence between the number of pollutants and the driving speed were established. Therefore, it needs to make investments in the transport sector: improving roads, the construction of bypasses, and the technical parameters of purchased cars.

AB  - Urgent transformational change and action within the built environment is needed as it accounts for a large proportion of CO2 emissions and is rapidly growing. A partnership with UN Habitat and Mistra, the Swedish foundation for strategic environmental research, was established to lead a high-level expert workshop for Northwest Europe to develop transformative roadmaps to lead us from current practice to a built and urban environment scenario where the 2030 UNSDGs are achieved. The workshop, aiming to act as a pilot for similar workshops to be held in other parts of the world, was organized around four worksheet sessions that guided the participants through a co-creative process to share and draw on their expertise generating and iteratively narrowing down ideas to actions. The workshop was held over 2 days with 30 participants from various countries and disciplines engaged in the built environment. A wide range of topics was identified to be focused on for action, however, 6 key themes were agreed upon as priorities: Renovation and adaptive reuse, Process and methods, Social sustainability, Nature and biodiversity, Infrastructure, and Sustainable livelihoods. The work towards realizing sustainable cities and buildings is ongoing and the pilot workshop is one step towards building collaborative capacity and facilitating regional, context-based action towards a sustainable transformation of the built environment.

AB  - Abstract Carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems, which is the basis of the global carbon cycle, reflects the changes in the environment due to anthropogenic impacts. Rapid and effective assessment of the impact of urban expansion on carbon reserves is vital for the sustainable development of urban ecosystems. Previous studies on future scenario simulations lacked research regarding the driving factors of changes in carbon storages within urban expansion, and the economic value accounting for changes in carbon storages. Therefore, this study examined Wuhan, China, and explored the latent effects of urban expansion on terrestrial carbon storage by combining the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) and Patch-generating Land Use Simulation (PLUS) model. Based on different socioeconomic strategies, we developed three future scenarios, including Baseline Scenario (BS), Cropland Protection Scenario (CP) and Ecological protection Scenario (EP), to predict the urban built-up land use change from 2015 to 2035 in Wuhan and discussed the carbon storage impacts of urban expansion. The result shows that (1) Wuhan’s urban built-up land area expanded 2.67 times between 1980 and 2015, which is approximately 685.17 km2 and is expected to continuously expand to 1349–1945.01 km2 by 2035. (2) Urban expansion in Wuhan has caused carbon storage loss by 5.12 × 106 t during 1980–2015 and will lead to carbon storage loss by 6.15 × 106 t, 4.7 × 106 t and 4.05 × 106 t under BS, CP, and EP scenarios from 2015 to 2035, accounting for 85.42%, 81.74%, and 78.79% of the total carbon loss, respectively. (3) The occupation of cropland by urban expansion is closely related to the road system expansion, which is the main driver of carbon storage reduction from 2015 to 2035. (4) We expect that by 2035, the districts facing carbon loss caused by the growth of urban built-up land will expand outward around secondary roads, and the scale of outward expansion under various scenarios will be ranked as BS > CP > EP. In combination, the InVEST and the PLUS model can assess the impact of urban expansion on carbon storage more efficiently and is conducive to carrying out urban planning and promoting a dynamic balance between urban economic development and human well-being.

AB  - Municipal solid waste (MSW) management is a global concern, especially in low-middle-income countries such as Pakistan, which require the redressal of MSW treatment issues to attain sustainability in the waste sector. The prosperity of municipal solid waste (MSW) collectors, i.e., the sanitary workers, is critical in the waste management hierarchy. Hence, the health, safety, social welfare, economic conditions and overall wellbeing of this tier need to be focused on more. Safeguarding the interests of the sanitary workers will support the MSW management sector in sustainability, which will help to generate revenue and minimize climatic impacts. An innovative MSW business model with waste ownership and technological intervention has excellent potential to support the sector towards a circular economy in Pakistan, the fifth most populous country in the world, generating about 100,000 metric tons of MSW per day. The proposed recycling business model will ensure a daily material recovery of 26,070 tons with 4721 tons of compost manufacturing in the country, which ultimately helps towards achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and meeting the targets of nationally determined contributors (NDCs) by 2030. In addition, the sector's economic potential can contribute 5.5% to the total annual budget and possibly pay 1.4% of the gross domestic product (GDP) per annum to service national foreign debt, thus helping maintain the debt threshold value with an opportunity to accelerate the economic growth of Pakistan.

AB  - The theme of urban redevelopment and regeneration has long been a priority in the international debate and current practices in the field of urban policies and strategic programs for sustainable development, implemented according to the circular economy model. In the contemporary city, there are fragments of unused, residual, abandoned landscapes, defined as "Waste LandScapes" which are the natural consequence of the metabolic process of growth and development of cities, both for the incompatibility of their original use and for the loss of their economic value. These waste landscapes, if inserted in virtuous processes of urban redevelopment, have a great intrinsic value and a considerable regenerative potential, capable of triggering virtuous development processes, not only on an urban scale but also on a territorial level. In this context, the research applied to a degraded area located on the edge of the historic center of Catanzaro (Italy) illustrates an adaptive and multi-methodological, inclusive and site-specific evaluation process, useful to support decision-makers in the selection of a shared scenario, evaluated both in multi-group and multi-criteria terms, capable of generating benefits in terms of cultural enhancement, social inclusion and economic development for a circular city.

AB  - The transition of the energy system to renewables can lead to inequities. Under-resourced and marginalized community members are vulnerable to disproportionate burdens of the energy system, particularly in postindustrial cities also grappling with social pressures associated with disinvestment and deindustrialization, climate change threats, and pressures of urban renewal. In this study, we use expert elicitation, ethnographic participant observation, and community focus groups to examine issues and conceptualizations of energy justice in a minority-majority post-industrial city undergoing rapid energy transformation alongside gentrification and other changing community dynamics. Building on community partnerships with NGOs, our team has worked closely with a previously defined "environmental justice" community to elicit the ways in which the energy transition is perceived to result in energy justice and injustice by energy system specialists and by community members. We find that community members in particular fear getting "priced out" of their community as energy system upgrades are implemented, and also feel that systemic injustices such as racialized governance structures would be exacerbated. We also identify the ways that energy justice is conceptualized whereby community members identify co-benefits such as improved housing, lower pollution, and an opportunity for energy democracy as possible outcomes of the energy transition. We offer concrete takeaways about the value of ethnographic energy justice research in partnership with communities and the application of energy justice frameworks that can be heeded by researchers and policymakers alike.

AB  - This essay examines the intersection of environmental justice activism and state-sponsored sustainable urban development-how is environmental justice activism enabled or disabled in the context of rapid urban development, consensual politics and the seemingly alpha-political language of sustainability? Drawing on ethnographic research conducted in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City, I define a process I refer to as "environmental gentrification," which builds on the material and discursive successes of the environmental justice movement and appropriates them to serve high-end development. While it appears as politically-neutral, consensus-based planning that is both ecologically and socially sensitive, in practice, environmental gentrification subordinates equity to profit-minded development. I propose that this process offers a new way of exploring the paradoxes and conundrums facing contemporary urban residents as they fight to challenge the vast economic and ecological disparities that increasingly divide today's cities.

AB  - Residential electricity consumption has an important impact on China’s construction of a low-carbon society. However, at present, little of the literature analyzes the influencing factors of residents’ overall well-being from the perspective of micro investigation. Based on the micro mixed cross section data of the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS), this paper empirically studies the impact of residential electricity consumption on residents’ subjective well-being. In addition, in the heterogeneity analysis, we found that an increase in residential electricity consumption will improve the overall well-being of females and people with low levels of education, but it has no significant effect on males and people with high levels of education. Moreover, the increase in residential electricity consumption has improved the life satisfaction of young people and middle-aged people. Meanwhile, the increase in residential electricity consumption has a significant, positive impact on both low-income and high-income households. Further analysis shows that no nonlinear relationship exists between the increase in residents’ power consumption and the improvement in life satisfaction. This paper enriches the research on residential energy and provides policy implications for the current Chinese government to save energy, reduce emissions, and improve residents’ quality of life.

AB  - Under the constraint of carbon neutrality targets, the issue of energy poverty has garnered increasing concerns. This study aims to measure energy poverty and assess the impact of renewable energy technology innovation in 30 provinces across China. Furthermore, it calculates city-level energy poverty in 274 cities. By examining the influence of renewable energy technology innovation on energy poverty, this study proposes a new approach to accelerate energy transition and promote sustainable development. The regression results, which have undergone rigorous robustness and endogeneity tests, demonstrate that renewable energy technology innovation significantly alleviates energy poverty. Moreover, the treatment effect of policies is determined through the regression control method. Specifically, the cities of Zhangjiakou, Baotou, and Qiqihar are analyzed to provide targeted suggestions for China’s energy development. The treatment effects of both provincial and city-level policies indicate that implementing renewable energy demonstration zones can effectively alleviate energy poverty.JEL Classification: Q48; O31

They are the guarantee for the realization of efficient and intelligent urban development and green ecological transformation, the basis for sustainable social and economic development, and the inevitable trend of urban development. Therefore, the evaluation of the development level of green and smart cities is of great significance to the development of Chinese cities. This paper has aimed to study the issue of smart city pilots and legal guarantees for green and low-carbon development and introduced the concept of smart city line management, as well as the related theory of entropy weight method, cloud model, and support vector machine algorithm. Based on the sustainable development index system, this paper has combined the low-carbon concept to construct the low-carbon city evaluation index system and carried out an empirical analysis. The sustainable development index system, the research results of low-carbon city, and the current situation and characteristics of low-carbon city construction are studied and analyzed. On this premise, a low-carbon city assessment framework in view of reasonable improvement is built, including low-carbon economy, low-carbon society, low-carbon climate, and low-carbon component. The experimental results of this paper show that the low-carbon environment subsystem has the best coordinated development among the four subsystems, and the current state is the best. By 2021, the coordination degree value has reached 0.6656, which is in a relatively coordinated state.

The main features and advantages of sustainable urban resource management are examined in this abstract. Cities are becoming more aware of the need to implement sustainable practices that reduce their negative effects on the environment and increase their overall resilience because of the fast urbanization trend. By combining several components—such as garbage, energy, water, and green spaces—sustainable urban resource management promotes a circular economy and reduces the environmental impact of urban growth. To improve the quality of the air and water, this strategy places a strong emphasis on utilizing resources efficiently, supporting renewable energy sources, and implementing green infrastructure. Cities may concurrently solve environmental concerns, improve social well-being, and spur economic growth by placing a high priority on sustainable practices. This abstract explores the various facets of sustainable urban resource management, highlighting how it can lead to the development of more resilient, habitable, and environmentally friendly urban environments. The Egyptian government started a comprehensive national initiative called the Hayaa Karima “Decent Life Initiative” in Egypt. Through the resolution of several socioeconomic issues and the advancement of sustainable development, it seeks to enhance the standard of living for residents in rural areas. To circulate the advancements in the public and local sectors, we will present in this search an analytical framework linked to key performance indicators for the main results of Hayaa Karima's initiatives as an internal audit.

AB  - As a critical engine for national economic growth, mega urban agglomerations have significant scale effects and economic and environmental spillover effects. This paper aims to study the green and low-carbon coordinated development of mega urban agglomerations to evaluate the country's level of ecological civilization and its green and low-carbon development. The traditional research on green and low-carbon urban development tends to homogenize the redistribution theme, leading to significant errors in spatial allocation. This results in a lower accuracy of spatial distribution calculations for green development. Additionally, the research is constrained by data precision and methodology, making it challenging to measure the spatial differences in green and low-carbon development within urban clusters at the block level. This limitation hinders the ability to conduct detailed studies on the efficiency variations of green and low-carbon development in urban clusters.To achieve this aim, the study adopts the DPSR framework of the economic, resource, social, and ecological environment complex system and focuses on the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area in China. The study uses the entropy method, Gini coefficient method, and non-expected output super-efficiency SBM model to analyze the spatial effects and development efficiency of green and low-carbon development in this region from 2006 to 2020. The study results indicate that: (1) the overall level of green and low-carbon development in the Greater Bay Area is on the rise, with Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Foshan, and Zhuhai showing more stable development than other cities.(2) The spatial differences in the region's level of green and low-carbon development have narrowed trends, mainly due to differences between regions. (3) The overall development efficiency of green and low-carbon in the Greater Bay Area is on the rise, with Guangzhou region showing overall stability, and Shenzhen region and Zhuhai region experiencing multiple ups and downs in their development. The three sub-regions show significant differences, but the balance and coordination of development have significantly improved. The study achieves a balance between the opportunity effects of green and low-carbon development and environmental policy constraints in super large urban clusters, effectively enhancing resource utilization efficiency in these clusters.

AB  - Accurate and timely urban boundaries can effectively quantify the spatial characteristics of urban evolution and are essential for understanding the impacts of urbanization processes and land-use changes on the environment and biodiversity. Currently, there is a lack of long time-series, high-resolution, nationally consistent Chinese urban boundary data for urban research. In this study, the city clustering algorithm was used to generate urban settlement boundaries in China based on the local density, size, and spatial relationships of impervious surfaces. The results showed that both the area and the number of urban settlements in China revealed an upward trend from 1985 to 2020, with East China (EC) being much higher than other regions and South China showing the most significant growth rate. The average area ratio of urban green space in China was 41.68%, with the average area ratio in EC being higher than in other regions. Meanwhile, Zipf’s law was used to verify the universality of urban settlement rank–size; the changes in the Zipf index from 1985 to 2020 also revealed that China’s urban size tended to be concentrated, and the development of large urban settlements was relatively prominent. The urban definition method we propose in this study can divide urban boundaries efficiently and accurately, identify urban expansion hotspots, and promote research on farmland loss and ecological land degradation, further exploring the impacts of urbanization on food security, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. By coupling big data such as economy, energy, and population with urban evolution patterns, urban managers can analyze current and future problems in urban development, thereby providing scientific decision-making for urban sustainability.
