10;10;JOUR;Time, the other dimension of urban form: Measuring the relationship between urban density and accessibility to grocery shops in the 10-minute city;ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE;English;['urban density', '10-minute city', 'time geography', 'accessibility', 'GIS', 'TRAVEL'];Compact settlements take advantage of economies of scale by sustaining a system of high-quality socio-economic services at close proximities. Urban density with a balanced mix of uses also benefits walking and cycling as mobility modes that provide sufficient access to urban amenities, especially when combined with effective public transport. Indeed, walking and cycling can decrease the use of cars for short-distance trips. From this perspective, urban density can help to reduce pollution, optimise energy consumption and decrease infrastructural expenditures while contributing to more attractive urban environments. These ideas have induced a new wave of time geography planning concepts, such as the '10-minute city', to enhance urban sustainability. For these concepts to move beyond visionary narratives, they must be expressed in specific empirical frameworks. Thus, the current research focuses on accessibility to grocery shops, as an essential urban service, in the Stavanger metropolitan area (Norway) using 10 minutes isochrones for walking and cycling. The study integrates open data, GIS network analyses, statistical regressions and bivariate representations of the results. The research estimates the level of serviceability by quantifying the number of shops that are accessible for each location and interrelates this estimation with spatial and population densities. The paper also presents a method to detect spatial inequalities by visualising over/under-serviced areas. This visualisation can become a tool to support strategies to rebalance such imbalances. Moreover, this study offers a practical approach towards the '10-minute city' concept, as it can be adjusted to different isochrones at different spatial scales. In general, this approach can serve both to analyse existing contexts and to model strategies to support sustainability policies, such as urban densification and the promotion of environmental-friendly transport.;Univ Stavanger, Postboks 8600 Forus, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway;Universitetet i Stavanger;2399-8083;2023;10.1177/23998083221103259;WOS:000808677500001;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  23', 'Total Times Cited:  23', 'Cited Reference Count:  29'];JAN;50;44;59;1;23998083221103259;MAY 2022;;-1;Time, the other dimension of urban form: Measuring the relationship between urban density and accessibility to grocery shops in the 10-minute city;"10.1177/23998083221103259

14;14;JOUR;Resilient and sustainable semiconductor supply chain network design under trade credit and uncertainty of supply and demand;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS;English;['Resilience', 'Sustainability', 'Supply chain network design', 'Multi -objective optimization', 'Trade credit', 'Semiconductor', 'EPSILON-CONSTRAINT METHOD'];Supply Chain (SC) performance appraisal extends beyond economic evaluation to encompass environmental and social impacts, as well as resilience to supply and demand disruptions. Thus, SC network design decisions should simultaneously optimize all these performance metrics as a primary objective. However, existing studies optimized these objectives independently or in a limited scope, failing to comprehensively address the interconnected nature of these performance metrics. Therefore, this study proposes a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model with four objectives to address a multi-tier resilient and sustainable semiconductor SC network design problem under trade credit, supply, and demand uncertainties. The model aims to determine the optimal number and location of various facilities, the amount to order from suppliers, economic production quantities, quantity allocation between SC entities, and ideal supplier selections. The proposed supply chain network contributes to the global effort to reduce carbon emissions and enhance the circular economy by considering carbon trading, recycling, and the proper disposal of end-of life products. Uncertainties in input parameters are addressed using a fuzzy programming approach, while lexicographic optimization and the epsilon-constraint method are used to solve the proposed model. This paper presents a numerical example to illustrate the applicability of the proposed model and provide managerial insights. The numerical analysis results show that provided an appropriate confidence level for the uncertain parameters, the sets of Pareto optimal solutions can be generated. And it also shows that the total SC cost increases with decreasing carbon emissions level and increasing job opportunities created.

To promote green consumption, the government may provide subsidies to consumers. Within a dynamic game where the manufacturer serves as the leader and the retailer acts as the follower, three cases are examined: centralized decision, decentralized decision with and without demand forecast information sharing between the retailer and the manufacturer. We mainly examine the value of information sharing on the decisions of a GSC in the context of government subsidies for consumers. We find that: (i) demand forecast information sharing benefits the manufacturer but damages the retailer; (ii) if the predicted value is higher than the determinate part of the demand, the manufacturer is willing to choose a higher green degree of products in the case with information sharing compared with that without information sharing; otherwise, the manufacturer is willing to choose a lower green degree of products; (iii) a two-part tariff contract is appropriate to coordinate the GSC and it is effective in increasing the green degree of products; (iv) information sharing benefits the GSC if the green production efficiency is high enough; (v) the ex-ante social welfare always increases with information accuracy.

151;151;JOUR;Is the 15-minute city within reach? Evaluating walking and cycling accessibility to grocery stores in Vancouver;TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH INTERDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVES;English;['Accessibility', '15-minute city', 'Walking', 'Cycling', 'Food environments'];"Leaders around the world have embraced the idea of a ""15-minute city"". This urban planning concept proposes a city where residents can meet their essential needs within a short walking or cycling trip from their home. Local access to grocery stores is a necessary component for cities to achieve the 15-minute city. This study aims to evaluate local accessibility to grocery stores by walking and cycling in the City of Vancouver. We used a cumulative opportunity measure to count the number of grocery stores available within a 15-minute walk and cycle from people's homes. To evaluate accessibility from the perspective of younger and older travellers, we considered different travel speeds. Our results show there is good accessibility to grocery stores when cycling, with less than 1% of the city's population not having a grocery store within a 15-minute cycle. When assuming a walking speed of an older pedestrian, around one-fifth of the population did not have access to a grocery store in their local area. The neighbourhoods that did not have a store within a 15-minute walk had higher proportions of children, older adults, and visible minorities, and lower rates of employment and post-secondary education attainment. In seeking to improve accessibility via walking and cycling, cities should prioritize grocery store locations and investments in pedestrian and cycling infrastructure to underserved neighbourhoods and populations.";Simon Fraser Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada;Simon Fraser University;2590-1982;2022;10.1016/j.trip.2022.100602;WOS:001089317600004;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  50', 'Total Times Cited:  52', 'Cited Reference Count:  23'];JUN;14;;;;100602;;;-1;Is the 15-minute city within reach?

As an emerging field, sustainable APP deals with the accommodation of environmental, economic as well as social sustainability criteria into the planning period which in turn can be achieved by making use of Circular Economy principles in real-world production activities. Different types of models and solution methods have been proposed by many researchers to study the APP problem with applications to a broad spectrum of industries. Yet, there are few studies in the literature that performs a comprehensive review of existing approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that offers a systematic review of APP research output spanning the last 50 years. We review about 200 APP papers and systematically classify them with respect to some basic properties (year, type, publisher, publication name and citations) as well as more technical aspects such as model type/structure, solution method, handling of uncertainty and extra features. The main purpose is to find out the current research landscape to link APP with Sustainable Development using digital technologies.

A smart inventory management system for managing medicines in a hospital supply chain (HSC) is one of the best solutions as its advantages ensure availability of affordable medicines as well as inventory cost reduction. Significant effort is made on inventory management from literature; however, smart inventory systems for HSC considering the various complexities and uniqueness of healthcare systems are limited. This paper attempts to fill this gap by developing a stochastic semi-Markov decision process model which is solved by a multi-agent reinforcement learning method. Data collected from a multispecialty hospital in India's eastern region serves to validate the proposed model. The results present the optimal order quantities and optimal inventory control policy for the HSC considering the uncertain medication demand at the hospital pharmacy and multiple point-of-care units, and demand dependencies among medicines prescribed to the patients admitted in the hospital.

However, considering the context of an emerging economy like Bangladesh, green supply chain management is still in its inception and has not been widely embraced in the textile industry, and therefore barriers hindering its adoption in emerging economy context demand a comprehensive investigation. This research reviews the viewpoints and hurdles in adopting green supply chain management practices in the context of the Bangladeshi textile industry. A questionnaire survey of Bangladeshi textile practitioners of operations and supply chain management division, having a sample size of thirty, was undertaken to identify the barriers, and a hierarchical cluster analysis technique was used in the detailed analysis of this data. Opinions were sought from experts on the significance of the resulting clusters, considering the relative importance of the barriers. Fifteen barriers to the adoption of green supply chain management were identified in the review of the literature, with these barriers then analyzed by using the data collected from Bangladeshi textile industry practitioners. The research indicates that the most important barrier is that there is low demand from customers and financial constraint resulting from short term little financial benefit to businesses, with lack of government regulations also a commonly faced barrier in adopting green supply chain initiatives. This study will provide valuables insights to practitioners and relevant policy makers about the barriers prevailing in the emerging economies towards the adoption of green supply chain management practices, which, in turn, can guide to undertake appropriate steps for alleviating those barriers.

304;304;JOUR;Steering model identification and control design of autonomous ship: a complete experimental study;SHIPS AND OFFSHORE STRUCTURES;English;['Model tests', 'system identification', 'steering control', 'PD control', 'IoT', 'nomoto model'];Steering ship models are important for the study of autonomous ship manoeuverability and design of ship motion control system. It is always a difficult task to find the mathematical model by first principle as it needs prior knowledge of hydrodynamic derivatives. The input-output-based system identification theory can be used to establish system mathematical models. A solution is offered by developing a Wi-Fi-based self-propelled, autonomous system for a ship model with Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities to perform manoeuvering and seakeeping tests in indoor environment without any complex mechanical structure, viz. following bridge. The developed autonomous on-board system equipped with main computer, suitable electronics, sensors, data acquisition system and Wi-Fi-based communication system. The developed system offers a cost effective, modular and portable solution to perform hydrodynamic studies of different hull form without incorporating major changes in the system. The use of IoT makes the data accessible to a naval architecture in real-time to analyse the motion response of the ship in different wave conditions and enables to implement the digital twin to simulate the real field scenario. Input-output-based model identification experiments such as turning circle and zig-zag tests are conducted to estimate the first-order steering model parameters and is further extended to design and implementation of a classical proportional-derivative-based steering control. The design is described in this paper with details of implementation on a demonstration oceanographic coastal research vessel. It illustrates the excellent communication between shore station computer and the on-board system on a wire-free model with robust control and exhibiting all the motion behaviour and dynamic effects.

305;305;JOUR;Investigation of rental business model for collaborative consumption-workwear garment renting in business-to-business scenario;RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING;English;['Collaborative consumption', 'Workwear apparel renting', 'Discrete event simulation', 'Business-to-business', 'MOTIVATIONS'];Increasing population and improving living standards have continued to amplify the consumption of textiles and apparel, which has created challenges in resource management and sustainable development. In this context, renting-based collaborative consumption business models (CCBMs) have received considerable attention in recent times. Consumption through renting allows the replacement of 'ownership' of a product to 'usership' which creates new opportunities for the companies as well as for the customers. For the development of renting based CCBMs or decision making in rental activities by the companies, one of the fundamental requirements is the baseline characterization of consumers' renting pattern - which includes general rent duration, renting frequency, inventory management, rental product movement, etc. - that acts as input from the operational aspect of a rental business. In this context, the paper aims at investigating the general renting characteristics for workwear garments through data analysis of about 5.4 million garment-rents to multiple business customers over 6 years. Further, the implications of the renting characteristics are investigated through discrete event simulations under various scenarios of inventory management by the customers. The findings from the study are anticipated to help the rental companies in operational and strategic decision-making.;Univ Boras, Boras, Sweden;University of Boras;0921-3449;2022;10.1016/j.resconrec.2022.106314;WOS:000806898600001;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7', 'Total Times Cited:  7', 'Cited Reference Count:  29'];JUL;182;;;;106314;APR 2022;;-1;Investigation of rental business model for collaborative consumption-workwear garment renting in business-to-business scenario;"10.1016/j.resconrec.2022.106314

Increased volume of traffic comes with increased greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gas impacts climate change and air pollution, increasing the risk of public health and safety. The European Union used Marco Polo to shift transit freight from road to sea, rail, and inland waterways to reduce the number of trucks on the road to lessen congestion, less pollution, and more reliable and efficient transport of goods. Fuel Tax Credit was similarly introduced in Australia to address some of these issues. It is now time to analyse the impact of these schemes. This paper is a systematic literature review using the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool and Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. Findings include using alternative modes of transport for long distances reduces carbon dioxide and the likelihood of using renewable fuels like electric and hydrogen fuel for trucks. However, research was limited on renewable fuels.;Federat Univ Australia, Inst Innovat Sci & Sustainabil, Ballarat, Vic, Australia;Federation University Australia;0975-6809;2023;10.1007/s13198-022-01693-3;WOS:000819913100001;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1', 'Total Times Cited:  1', 'Cited Reference Count:  29'];DEC;14;954;960;SUPPL 4;;JUL 2022;;-1;Studies on the impact of road freight transport and alternative modes in Australia: a literature study;"10.1007/s13198-022-01693-3

Recycling rate of copper is high and its scrap requires less energy than primary production, so sustainable closed-loop supply chain network design is considered a primary decision. Besides, the uneven distribution of copper has exaggerated the destructive effects of natural disasters such as earthquakes on mines. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no research about copper supply chain network design. In this paper, a copper network is designed and backup suppliers are used as a resilience strategy to reduce the effects of earthquakes on mining operations. Without backup model and with backup model are presented as multi-objective and are compared with each other. In each model, the economic objective is to maximize the supply chain profit; the environmental objective is to minimize water consumption and air pollutants; and the social objective is to maximize social desirability by considering security and unemployment rates. The models are formulated using mixed-integer linear programming and they are solved by epsilon-constraint and weighted sum methods. Results show that, with backup model increases the supply chain responsiveness. Also, the model is able to improve the economic and social performances of the supply chain. But in environmental aspect, it performs worse than without backup model. This is because the backup suppliers are added to the supply chain and their exploitation will create negative environmental effects. In addition, using copper scraps saves costs, energy and the consumption of this non-renewable metal.

However, the material implications-i.e., where and in which form manufacturing should concretely take place in cities and the consequences on urban space and relations-are rarely addressed in debates on (re)industrialisation. In this article, we engage with the concept of conspicuous production by combining research on mixed-use zones with sensory methodologies. We focus on the multisensory dimension of urban manufacturing to interrogate the spatial possibilities for production in a small town in Switzerland. Together with a group of graduate students, we apply sensory methods to explore how production shapes urban sensescapes and how these sensescapes affect our relation to production. Our exploratory endeavour provides ideas of how sensory methods can be integrated into urban planning research and practice: we suggest that these methods, which necessarily emphasise subjective experience, can constitute powerful tools if they take into attentive consideration the local political and economic context, including the norms and power relations that shape individual perception. Our study sparks critical questions about conspicuous production and mixed-use zoning and tentatively advances the concept of sensible production: a production that not only is perceptible and can actively be engaged with, but that also shows good sense, makes sense, and focuses on what we need rather than on appearance.;Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Bern, Switzerland;University of Bern;2183-7635;2020;10.17645/up.v8i4.7272;WOS:001110878800001;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0', 'Total Times Cited:  0', 'Cited Reference Count:  54'];;8;198;210;4;;;;-1;Sensing Urban Manufacturing: From Conspicuous to Sensible Production;"10.17645/up.v8i4.7272

Meanwhile small, socially oriented firms may have the will but lack the means to change dominant practices when entering a market. In this context 3D printing may offer a solution, by leveraging the voluntary effort of individuals through open design and distributed production. A system dynamics approach is applied to the case of a socially oriented mobile phone producer, whose fair supply chain practices may initially appeal only to a niche market. We examine how open design of 3D printed mobile phone accessories helps overcome size-related resource constraints, facilitate market growth and ultimately generate sufficient consumer demand to alter the market leaders' supply chain practices, in favour of social sustainability. Our findings demonstrate the interaction between availability of 3D printers, consumer attitudes to social sustainability and the market entry.

Central to the idea, this study aims to design a closed loop supply chain (CLSC) network for an Indian laptop manufacturer. The network configuration, which involves a manufacturer, suppliers, third party logistics providers (forward and reverse), retailers, customers and a non-government organisation (NGO), is modelled as a mixed integer linear programming problem with fuzzy goals of minimising environmental impact and maximising net profit and social impact, subject to fuzzy demand and capacity constraints. Profit is generated from the sale of primary and secondary laptops, earned tax credits, and revenue sharing with reverse logistics providers. The environmental implications are investigated by measuring the carbon emitted due to activities of manufacturing, assembling, dismantling, fabrication, and transportation. The social dimension is quantified in terms of the number of jobs created, training hours, community service hours, and donations to NGO. The novelty of the model rests on its quantification of the three triple bottom line (TBL) indicators and on its use of AHP-TOPSIS for modelling the multi-criteria perspectives of the stakeholders. Numerical weights for the triple lines of sustainability are utilized. Further, a fuzzy multi-objective programming approach that integrates fuzzy set theory with goal programming techniques is utilised to yield properly efficient solutions to the multi-objective problem and to provide a trade-off set for conflicting objectives. The significance of the CLSC model is empirically established as a decision support tool for improving the TBL performance of a particular Indian laptop manufacturer. Practical and theoretical implications are derived from the result analysis, and a generalised quantitative closed-loop model can be effectively adapted by other electronic manufacturers to increase their competitiveness, profitability, and to improve their TBL.;Univ Delhi, Dept Operat Res, Delhi, India;University of Delhi;0254-5330;2019;10.1007/s10479-017-2701-2;WOS:000456384300024;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  79', 'Total Times Cited:  85', 'Cited Reference Count:  100'];FEB;273;693;738;1-2;;;;-1;Fuzzy criteria programming approach for optimising the TBL performance of closed loop supply chain network design problem;"10.1007/s10479-017-2701-2

It is a fact that innovation is very significant in achieving long-term sustainability in the supply chain. Literature analysis reveals that an in-depth investigation of SSCI implementation framework in developing nations is still limited. Hence, this research work investigates the sustainable supply chain innovation enablers (SSCIEs) to achieve sustainability in the supply chain using the Pythagorean fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) framework. The proposed framework is applied to an Indian manufacturing industry for the adoption of SSCIEs in its supply chain. This research identifies a total of thirty-three SSCIEs through extensive literature review and consultation with the decision-making panel. The identified enablers are then ranked based on their relative importance weight. The results reveal that 'collaboration and engagement of a diverse group of stakeholders (suppliers, local people, customers, environmental specialists, NGOs)' is the most critical SSCIE to achieve sustainability in the supply chain, followed by 'develop R&D labs in relationships with marketing, production, universities, and government institutes'. Sensitivity analysis is also performed in this study to check the robustness in the ranking of SSCIEs. This research helps the managers/policy-makers of the Indian manufacturing industry to identify and understand the most significant SSCIEs to achieve sustainability in the supply chain. The ranking of SSCIEs assists the managers to systematically focus on the most significant SSCIE and work towards its successful adoption. This study implies that the successful adoption of SSCIEs enables simultaneous improvement in social, environmental, and economic dimensions for Indian manufacturing industries.

However, little work has been done to simultaneously assess the impact of various vehicle types on populations of different socioeconomic/ethnic backgrounds. In this study, we employed an extreme gradient-boosting approach to spatially distribute light-duty vehicle (LDV) and heavy-duty truck emissions across the city of Toronto from 2006 to 2020. We examined associations between these emissions and different marginalization indices across this time span. Despite a large decrease in traffic emissions, disparities in exposure to traffic-related air pollution persisted over time. Populations with high residential instability, high ethnic concentration, and high material deprivation were found to reside in regions with significantly higher truck and LDV emissions. In fact, the gap in exposure to traffic emissions between the most residentially unstable populations and the least residentially unstable populations worsened over time, with trucks being the larger contributor to these disparities. Our data also indicate that the number of trucks and truck emissions increased substantially between 2019 and 2020 whilst LDVs decreased. Our results suggest that improvements in vehicle emission technologies are not sufficient to tackle disparities in exposure to traffic-related air pollution.;Univ Toronto, Dept Civil & Mineral Engn, Toronto, ON M5S 1A4, Canada;University of Toronto;0013-936X;2022;10.1021/acs.est.2c04320;WOS:000890418200001;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9', 'Total Times Cited:  12', 'Cited Reference Count:  58'];DEC 6;56;16621;16632;23;;NOV 2022;;-1;Fifteen Years of Community Exposure to Heavy-Duty Emissions: Capturing Disparities over Space and Time;"10.1021/acs.est.2c04320

By analysing 60 Blockchain-based frameworks, the study highlights the most frequently employed drivers such as transparency, traceability, and security within food supply chains. Additionally, underexplored applications such as food donation and redistribution, supply chain financing, animal welfare, food waste management, and data analysis are identified, revealing opportunities for further innovation. The research employed NVivo 14 to analyze the extent of Blockchain's implementation in various food supply chain drivers, and the findings informed the development of a more diverse framework for Blockchain integration. Key insights demonstrate Blockchain's transformative potential, particularly in enhancing data integrity, trust, and operational efficiency through its immutable ledger and smart contracts, which streamline transactions, cut administrative costs, and reduce fraud. In terms of sustainability and safety, Blockchain improves traceability, accelerates safety responses, promotes environmental sustainability by tracking resource usage, and enhances humanitarian efforts with transparent, efficient resource distribution. Additionally, Blockchain facilitates food waste reduction by optimizing inventory and distribution, while ensuring surplus food reaches those in need. The study concludes by offering a roadmap for future research, pointing toward untapped dimensions of Blockchain's application in food traceability, sustainable supply chain management, and environmental & social impact. While the review provides a comprehensive understanding of Blockchain's current usage in food supply chains, the scope is limited by the systematic review process and specific inclusion criteria.

This changing mannerism has escalated the GHG emissions from the fashion industry. Energy-intensive raw material production, preparation, and processing contribute to considerable emissions. The management of the returned goods from the primary market and further processing through the secondary outlets indulge in reverse logistics. In this paper, efforts are made to minimize the total cost and the carbon emission amount during the process of managing the return articles from the primary market to the reverse distribution center, further processing of the articles at the secondary outlet, and the return of the unsold or excess articles from the secondary outlet. Reverse cross-docking has been implemented in managing the return articles, while environmental concerns over GHG emissions have been addressed by investing in green technology under a strict carbon cap policy. In this research, return articles from the primary and secondary markets, rework of the returned articles, and disposal of the impaired returned articles have been considered. The carbon emission cost at all stages of transportation, rework, or disposal has also been incorporated into this model. A constrained mixed integer linear programming model is proposed and solved considering green investment. A numerical example has been formulated to investigate the effect of green technology on the total cost. The results portray that, though the total cost increases by nearly 2% due to investment in green technology, it ensures a considerable drop of 23% in the carbon emission amount. Also, the result is successful in establishing that reverse cross-docking is a better option than traditional warehousing in terms of minimizing the cost.";Banasthali Vidyapith, Dept Math & Stat, Banasthali 304022, Rajasthan, India;Banasthali Vidyapith;2227-7390;2023;10.3390/math11132880;WOS:001031057300001;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6', 'Total Times Cited:  6', 'Cited Reference Count:  68'];JUL;11;;;13;2880;;;-1;How Effective Is Reverse Cross-Docking and Carbon Policies in Controlling Carbon Emission from the Fashion Industry?;"10.3390/math11132880

This complexity requires detailed security and traceability, essential to track every stage from production to consumption, and to ensure that data is both secure and authentic. Errors in this process, particularly in the case of sensitive products such as foodstuffs or medicines, can have serious consequences. In this context, much research has explored the use of blockchain technology to improve supply chain security and traceability. However, these solutions have proved incomplete, leaving the way open to new challenges. Our paper sits at the frontier of this emerging research, proposing a novel approach that combines blockchain and QR codes to address the complex needs of supply chain management. We present an architecture that offers unrivalled traceability thanks to the use of unique QR codes for each product, immutably recorded on the blockchain. Each scanned QR code automatically triggers the recording of information on the blockchain via smart contracts, ensuring a precise history that will be accessible to all stakeholders in the chain. Our solution also offers exceptional granularity, enabling each product to be tracked individually, which previous approaches did not allow. This is crucial for ensuring product safety and compliance, boosting consumer confidence and reducing the risk of counterfeiting. Although three similar initiatives have been identified in the literature, our architecture stands out for its level of detail and explicitness, providing the bases. However, widespread adoption will require continued collaboration to standardise protocols and ensure global interoperability.

In this study, an integrated and comprehensive decision-making framework is proposed to support the strategic planning and tactical management of regional biomass supply networks from an energy- land-carbon nexus perspective. It combines a multi-objective fuzzy chance-constraint programming model with spatial analysis of marginal land and multi-criteria assessment of biorefinery sites. The model is verified through a case study of a major agricultural region, Shandong Province in China. Local agricultural residues remain a key feedstock for bioethanol production. The results highlight the importance of considering the multi-objective tradeoffs and the intricate resource and environmental nexus for stakeholders to achieve sustainability in real practice. A cost-minimization objective drives the construction of large-scale biomass plants to enhance efficiency. An emissions-minimization goal favors smaller, decentralized plants to reduce transport distances and improve local land use.

To respond to this confluence that has created an emerging existential crisis, we identify that a globalizing circular economy (CE) is required and subsequently define a new construct: sustainable international business model innovations. In doing so, we introduce circular inputs, sharing platforms, product as a service, product use extension, and resource recovery as business models that contain the potential to reply to these grand challenges. Based on CE principles, the innovations and designs introduced are contrasted with the traditional linear economic model and are presented as actionable standardization/adaptation alternatives for companies responding to differing informal and formal international institutions. Based on the theoretical underpinnings of the resource-based, dynamic capabilities, and international business model innovation perspectives, we introduce an integrative framework that is accompanied by a series of detailed research questions to provide future research opportunities for the domain.

Design/methodology/approach A trade-off model of transit time and transport costs based on quantitative data from primary and secondary sources is developed to demonstrate the market niche for Eurasian rail freight vis-a-vis the more established modes of transport of sea, air and sea/air. In a scenario analysis, further cargo attributes influencing modal choice are employed to show for which cargo type Eurasian rail freight service is favourable from a shipper's point of view. Findings At present, Eurasian rail freight is about 80% less expensive than air freight with only half of the transit time of conventional sea freight. Our scenario analysis further suggests that for shipping time-sensitive goods with lower cargo value ranging from $US1.23/kg to $US10.89/kg as well as goods with lower time sensitivity and higher value in a range of $US2.46/kg to $US21.78/kg, total logistics costs of Eurasian rail freight service rail is cheaper than all other modes of transport. Practical implications As an emerging competitive solution, Eurasian rail freight demonstrates to be an option beneficial in terms of transport cost, transit time, reliability and service availability, which offers a cost-efficient option enabling shippers to build up agile and more sustainable supply chains between China and Europe.

This challenge implies issues regarding health, energy, safety, environment and quality of life. Achieving a fair traffic outcome is a key priority for city traffic managers while maintaining city's attractiveness for citizens and travelers and those carrying out commercial activities. As a part of this challenge, delivery and similar companies are relevant stakeholders in optimizing their routes, deliveries, and operational services. It is in this respect that urban traffic and its regulations play a key role.The conditions in which urban traffic takes place thus have to be known and one way to deal with this is based on available and accessible data. In the IoT age, there could be huge amounts of available data generated by countless sensors and systems involved in our lives, cities, infrastructures, etc.... Taking advantage of such data, when the accessibility and quality is good enough, can help us to achieve the desired goals concerning the urban traffic and its consequences. However, in practice, the availability and access to such data is currently a very serious challenge.Following on with this, data generated from the ever-increasing number of sensors on board vehicles could be very useful, not only for checking the vehicle condition, but also to gain a better of the ""real-time""traffic situation or to discover traffic behaviors/patterns from the said data. In this work, a real case based study has been carried out gathering basic real GPS information regarding delivery vehicles in a city environment and OpenData to ""discover""where, when and how long time delivery vehicles use the regulated parking zones for loading/unloading in the city center. Based on Expert Rules, a stop detection criteria is defined and formulated to be applied to real cases in urban areas, focusing on city centers and Machine Learning techniques to discover stop and park behaviors on last mile deliveries in a real urban area.All this is used to plan traffic strategies and facilities which can permit better and more fluent services.

Different from the sea waterway, the navigable ship size in an inland river corridor is restricted by the waterway depths in the plentiful and drought periods. This paper deals with the design issue of ship fleet size in an inland river corridor with seasonal change in waterway depth using a vertical structure model. The interactions among consignors, competitive carriers and a public port operator over plentiful and drought periods are considered in the proposed model, together with the impacts of seasonal waterway depth on the ship fleet size. The consignors aim to minimize transport cost by choosing transfer ports in each period. The competitive carriers are intended to maximize their own net profit by determining the shipping freight rates in each period and the ship fleet size (ship frequencies and composition of ship size) over a given time horizon. A public port operator, as an agent of the government, decides the port service charges in each period to maximize social welfare over the given time horizon. The effects of the ratio of drought period duration to plentiful period duration (duration ratio), the ratio of small ship size to big ship size (ship size ratio), and the actual cargo load of big ship in the drought period on the stakeholders and the system are investigated. The results show that: (i) the government always tends to subsidize the carrier at each port in the plentiful period for a large duration ratio, but to subsidize the carrier at its competitive port in the drought period for a small duration ratio and a low cargo load of a big ship at each port; and (ii) a single big (or small) ship type strategy will underestimate (or overestimate) the ship fleet size for a low cargo load of a big ship in the drought period. The method proposed in this paper can serve as a useful tool for the fleet size plan for the carriers and for port regulation for the government so as to achieve a ""win-win-win"" outcome among consignors, carriers and port operator.";Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China;Huazhong University of Science & Technology;0967-070X;2025;10.1016/j.tranpol.2025.03.005;WOS:001446439700001;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0', 'Total Times Cited:  0', 'Cited Reference Count:  50'];JUN;166;108;123;;;;;-1;Optimal ship fleet size in an inland river corridor with seasonal change in waterway depth;"10.1016/j.tranpol.2025.03.005

The use of energy in individual areas of the enterprise is influenced by the different technologies, processes and products used energy sources and prices, political, economic and business situation. When we extend the environment to society as such, we can talk about sustainable logistics. By integrating energy use and sustainable green logistics, we can contribute to energy efficiency in production and green logistics. The article deals with the application of green logistics as a part of Corporate Social Responsibility in the ongoing process of globalization. The key to understanding the CSR concept is the organization's goal. A socially responsible company is not only aimed at maximizing profits, but its goals are based on the needs of the internal and external environment and include the social and environmental aspects of its activities.

Machine learning is typically limited to the application of online monitoring of AM systems due to a lack of accurate and accessible databases. In this work, a system is developed for real-time identification of defective regions, and closed-loop adjustment of process parameters for robot-based CFRP AM is validated. The main novelty is the development of a deep learning model for defect detection, classification, and evaluation in realtime with high accuracy. The proposed method is able to identify two types of CFRP defects (i.e., misalignment and abrasion). The combined deep learning with geometric analysis of the level of misalignment is applied to quantify the severity of individual defects. A deep learning approach is successfully developed for the online detection of defects, and the defects are effectively controlled by closed-loop adjustment of process parameters, which is never achievable in any conventional methods of composite fabrication.;Northwestern Polytech Univ, Unmanned Syst Res Inst, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China;Northwestern Polytechnical University;0736-5845;2023;10.1016/j.rcim.2022.102431;WOS:000843304800001;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  64', 'Total Times Cited:  67', 'Cited Reference Count:  45'];FEB;79;;;;102431;AUG 2022;;-1;Deep learning-assisted real-time defect detection and closed-loop adjustment for additive manufacturing of continuous fiber-reinforced polymer composites;"10.1016/j.rcim.2022.102431

This article surveys the evidence on the determinants of industry location in developing countries. It also employs micro data for India and Indonesia to illustrate recent spatial dynamics of manufacturing relocation within urban agglomerations. Both theory and empirical evidence suggest that agglomeration benefits, market access, and infrastructure endowments in large cities outweigh the costs of congestion, higher wages, and land prices. Despite this evidence, many countries have tried to encourage industrial firms to locate in secondary cities or other lagging areas. Cross-country evidence suggests that fiscal incentives to do so rarely succeed. They appear to influence business location decisions among comparable locations, but the result may be a negative-sum game between regions and inefficiently low tax rates, which prevent public goods from being funded at sufficiently high levels. Relocation tends to be within and between agglomerations rather than from large cities to smaller cities or lagging regions. Rather than provide subsidies and tax breaks, policymakers should focus on streamlining laws and regulations to make the business environment more attractive.;World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA;The World Bank;0257-3032;2008;10.1093/wbro/lkn007;WOS:000258331800005;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  44', 'Total Times Cited:  48', 'Cited Reference Count:  68'];FAL;23;219;246;2;;;;-1;Industrial location in developing countries;"10.1093/wbro/lkn007

This study aims to investigate the intricate relationship between ICT and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from transport in SSA. Employing the panel quantile autoregressive distributed lag (PQARDL) technique, the study analyzes panel data from 24 SSA nations spanning from 2000 to 2021. The results indicate that internet usage and fixed telephone subscriptions have a mitigating effect on CO2 emissions from transport across all quantiles in both the short and long run. However, mobile phone subscriptions contribute to CO2 emissions from transport across all quantiles. Additionally, the middle-income groups demonstrate negative relationships between ICT variables and emissions from transport, while the low-income group exhibits significant positive associations. These findings imply that ICT plays a pivotal role in mitigating transport-based emissions and reveal pronounced disparities in ICT adoption across various income groups within SSA, highlighting overarching underdevelopment in ICT infrastructure. Robustness checks employing a two-step system generalized method of moment (GMM) model reinforce our findings.

A Tobit regression model has been used for the data analysis in order to identify the most influential factors affecting the consumers' WTP. Results suggest that consumers' WTP is mainly influenced by environmental attitudes, knowledge and possibility of engaging in responsible purchasing, and the approval of friends and relatives (social norms).

To address these issues and promote industrial upgrading, China's central government has issued a national relocation and improvement policy targeting its chemical industry. However, its countrywide policy implementation may also lead to other ESG risks during the relocation of chemical enterprises, namely industrial transfer. The typical ESG risks that appear to occur in developed eastern region provinces include a one-size-fits-all solution and unemployment, while less developed central and western region provinces may encounter pollution transfer, carbon leakage, environmental injustice, and health disparities. These ESG risks might overlap with other economic and financial (non-ESG) risks, like stranded assets, industry hollowing-out, and debt sustainability issue. These ESG and non-ESG risks could result from potential mismatches between chemical enterprises and chemical parks, categorized as mismatching errors explained by social-ecological systems, behavioral economics, and information economics. To better manage these risks, we propose an ESG matching policy comprising a national standardized ESG scoring and ranking system, a deferred acceptance mechanism, and a score announcement instrument. Such a policy innovation aims at achieving fair and efficient chemical enterprise-chemical park pairs, which would help manage both ESG and non-ESG risks and provide a just transition toolkit for China and other developing countries.;Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA;Duke University;2071-1050;2024;10.3390/su16229760;WOS:001366044600001;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0', 'Total Times Cited:  0', 'Cited Reference Count:  53'];NOV;16;;;22;9760;;;-1;A Matching Policy to Address ESG and Non-ESG Risks Impacted by a Relocation Policy in China's Chemical Industry;"10.3390/su16229760

However, they severely impact the environment and public health. This study presents a novel truck detection framework by combining satellite imagery with Geographic Information System (GIS)-based OpenStreetMap data to capture the distribution of heavy-duty trucks and shipping containers in both on-road and off-road locations with extensive spatial coverage. The framework involves modifying the CenterNet detection algorithm to detect randomly oriented trucks in satellite images and enhancing the model through ensembling with Mask RCNN, a segmentation-based algorithm.

One of the key elements is a more stringent greenhouse gas emission reduction target of 55% below 1990 levels by 2030. We analyse the socio-economic consequences of alternative policy pathways to reach that target, either relying more on regulatory standards, on carbon pricing, or a mix of both. We develop a modelling framework that captures macro-economic and sectoral impacts and closely aligns economic and energy system modelling. We further decompose aggregate labour market outcomes into skill and occupation types, and downscale representative household results to micro-level household data to evaluate the distributional effects across income groups with heterogeneous expenditure patterns. By combining models and datasets, our framework enables incorporating a high degree of technological detail while revealing socio-economic aspects of the transition that may go unnoticed in coarse, aggregate assessments. In particular, our results highlight the heterogeneous impacts of climate policy across sectors, worker skill types and income groups, which may require particular attention in climate policy design and corresponding complementary measures to ensure a fair transition to a low-carbon economy.;European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr JRC, Seville, Spain;University of Central Asia;0921-8009;2023;10.1016/j.ecolecon.2022.107660;WOS:000891305300002;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  25', 'Total Times Cited:  25', 'Cited Reference Count:  45'];FEB;204;;;;107660;;;-1;A comprehensive socio-economic assessment of EU climate policy pathways;"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2022.107660

This paper examines CO2 emissions and social welfare implications of the intermodal competition between the emerging CR Express and incumbent maritime shipping. An analytical model is developed, which shows that the implications depend in general on the relative emission intensities of the two transport modes on a per-trip basis. The entry of CR Express and the resultant intermodal competition, while likely improving welfare, will increase emissions unless CR Express is sufficiently emission efficient. Such impacts on emissions and welfare are enhanced when there are more CR Express operators, or when there are fewer shipping carriers. The competition among Chinese local governments in supporting their own CR Express services also strengthens the impacts. The analytical model is further calibrated with real market and operational data on the route between China's Yangtze River Delta and Central Europe. Our numerical simulations show that intermodal competition leads to more emissions unless CR Express can achieve an approximately 90% reduction in emission intensity and that overall welfare is nonetheless improved.

As an example, urban deliveries are sometimes not taken into account in the urban planning of cities or are simply misunderstood. This reality highlights the need for accessible and straightforward decision support tools in this field. In this work an interactive simulation is proposed as a playful tool to disseminate theoretical results from academia and lessons learned towards non-experts, who can easily interact with a model. The proposed interactive simulator aims at helping actors to broadly share and enlarge their perspective about a specific problem. That is, identifying the different objectives and constraints of other actors and converging towards a collective solution to the problem at hand. A trial was performed with 28 participants that explored and compared two different distribution schemes using interactive simulation. Positive feedback from the participants shows promising perspectives for this type of tool. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Potential mediation of green supply chain management practices;BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT;English;['blockchain technology', 'environmental SDGs', 'green supply chain management', 'ADOPTION', 'ACCEPTANCE', 'FRAMEWORK'];The nexus between manufacturing firms and the green environment is unavoidable. It is merely due to the huge waste generation and greenhouse gas emissions resulting from large-scale production and complex supply chain management processes involved in manufacturing firms. Continuation of the traditional business practices during Industry 4.0 made it impossible for the manufacturing firm to commit to green environmental practices and comply with environmental SDGs. At odd, it requires novel business strategies to ensure compliance of manufacturing firms with environmental sustainable development goals (SDGs). Blockchain is an ideal technology for delivering green environmental-related information because it offers real-time, shareable, and entirely transparent data kept on an immutable ledger that is accessible to members of a network. These green environmental-related information received in real-time through blockchain technology help in the transformation of the traditional supply chain management practices into a more green supply chain management practice. This green transformation ensures business compliance with environmental SDGs and that compliance is shared with multiple stakeholders through blockchain technology in real-time, thus approving a positive mediating role of green supply chain management practices between blockchain technology and environmental SDGs performance. The proposed strategic framework through various propositions development will mainly offer policy insights toward (a) identifying novel antecedents of blockchain technology, (b) offering insights toward upgrading the traditional supply chain management framework into a green supply chain management framework, and (c) illuminating novel mediating role of green supply chain management practices between blockchain technology and environmental SDGs performance.;Wenzhou Kean Univ, Coll Business & Publ Management, Sch Management & Mkt, Wenzhou, Peoples R China;Wenzhou-Kean University;0964-4733;2024;10.1002/bse.3579;WOS:001073236300001;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  18', 'Total Times Cited:  18', 'Cited Reference Count:  81'];MAR;33;2004;2019;3;;OCT 2023;;-1;Can blockchain technologies enhance environmental sustainable development goals performance in manufacturing firms?

In this regard, routing algorithms are used to navigate mobile industrial robots for optimizing shop-floor logistics operations. However, open-source tools and software libraries implementing routing algorithms provide limited real-world relevance via indicatively neglecting the physical operating environment's characteristics and the kinematics of mobile robots. To this effect, this research designs, analyzes and develops MIROR, a middleware software tool that interfaces mobile industrial robots with route optimization algorithms to deliver a sophisticated testing environment that: (i) applies routing algorithms for the optimal logistics of mobile robots in customized industrial facility layouts; (ii) allows the comparison of the resulting algorithmic outcomes to inform about effective and efficient routing options; and (iii) creates optimal routing plans for informing the logistics operations of equivalent real-world mobile robots in industrial manufacturing settings. Specifically, MIROR integrates open-source Operations Research tools and the Robot Operating System to simulate and explore alternative logistics scenarios for mobile robots in 3D recreated industrial manufacturing facilities. To a greater extent, MIROR allows the transfer of the optimal routing code to equivalent real-world vehicles. Specifically, the implemented middleware tool handles variations of the Traveling Salesman Problem and generates feasible routes in complex facility layouts considering a variety of mobile robots. Academics and practitioners could benefit from the user-friendly interface of MIROR to generate realistic scheduling and routing options for the optimal planning of the logistics operations of mobile industrial robots in manufacturing environments.

This study examines the driving forces of sustainable supply chain management practices. Drowning on institutional theory and the resource-based view, this study empirically examines the driving effects of institutional pressures (in terms of governance pressure, customer pressure, and competitive pressure) and internal sustainability capabilities (in terms of top management leadership and technical capability) and their interactions on sustainable supply chain management practices. Based on empirical analysis of data from 172 Chinese firms, the findings reveal that institutional pressures and sustainability capabilities simultaneously and jointly motivate the implementation of sustainable supply chain management practices. Interestingly, the interactions of technical capabilities with governance pressures and customer pressures significantly and negatively influence sustainable supply chain management practice adoption, while the interactions of top management leadership with competitive pressures positively affect the pursuit of sustainable supply chain management practices.

The integrated sustainable-green-lean-six sigma-agile manufacturing system (ISGLSAMS) provides a solid platform for meeting both the customers' variety needs and business sustainability requirements. Many organizations opted for ISGLSAMS, but still due to various barriers organizations are not able to fully implement ISGLSAMS. The purpose of this paper is to identify the barriers to the ISGLSAMS, so that a more sustainable industrial manufacturing system and industrial symbiosis can be developed. Design/methodology/approach A literature review, from the Web of Science and Google Scholar database, has been carried out to identify the various barriers to the implementation of ISGLSAMS in the entire value chain. A total of 168 research papers have been reviewed for identifying the ISGLSAMS barriers. Findings This paper elaborates the concept of the ISGLSAMS, its attributes and various barriers and contributes to a better understanding and successful implementation of ISGLSAMS to meet business' sustainability and market performance goals in the entire value chain. The paper also projects the future research framework and directions for the ISGLSAMS, integrated sustainable-green-lean-six sigma-agile (ISGLSA) product and ISGLSA supply and value chain. Practical implications The study contributes to a better understanding of ISGLSAMS' barriers. The government, stakeholders and policymakers may plan the policy, road map and strategies to overcome the ISGLSAMS' barriers. In-depth knowledge of subclauses of ISGLSAMS' barriers will help the practitioners to overcome the ISGLSAMS' barriers strategically. By overcoming the ISGLSAMS barriers, a more sustainable 7 Rs based market focused manufacturing system can be designed. This will also increase the opportunities to enhance the industrial ecology, industrial symbiosis and better recovery of the product, process and supply chain residual value. This will reduce the waste to the ecosystem. Originality/value This work has been carried out in search of a more sustainable manufacturing system, i.e. ISGLSAMS (which is 7 Rs based, i.e. 6 Rs of sustainability with 7th R, reconfiguration) to meet the customer variety needs along with sustainability in the ever-changing customer market. This study adds value to the practitioners to identify and prioritize the ISGLSAMS' industry-specific barriers and design the solution for the more sustainable development of (1) industries, (2) the industrial symbiosis system and (3) the ISGLSA product, process, system and supply value chain with minimum resource consumption and environmental impact.

The social concern of air pollution is the motivation towards the proposed study. In this study, we propose an optimization model for designing a sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) network that attempts to reduce carbon emission, improve social benefits and eventually improve customer experience. The optimization model is a multi objective mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation. The proposed model is a multi raw-material, multi-product, multi-period, multi-sites model that focuses on improving three dimensions of sustainability: viz. economic, environmental and social.

Meanwhile, trade-in programs are widely implemented to boost sales and enhance product recycling, which would benefit the environment. It is widely observed that many companies implement the green technology (GT) and trade-in program together. However, whether this act is always beneficial to the environment is unclear. We hence build analytical models to address this issue. To conduct a comprehensive study, we follow the real-world practices and examine both the retailer collects (R-collect) and manufacturer collects (M-collect) scenarios in a supply chain. Our results show that the ""R-collect scheme with GT"" leads to the highest levels of supply chain profit and social welfare but more emissions may be generated. Besides, implementing GT does not always benefit the environment in both R-collect and M-collect schemes. Considering from the environment perspective, we interestingly show that governments should advocate the ""M-collect with GT"" and ""R-collect without GT"" schemes. Correspondingly, to motivate both the supply chain and consumers to accept the advocated strategies, we characterize the carbon tax and subsidy based ""carrot-and-stick"" policy. We further show in the extended analyses that our main results hold under competition, when the emission abatement cost takes different analytical forms, and when consumers are environmentally conscious.

This paper proposes an innovative HW reverse logistics network (RLN) considering advanced co-processing in cement kiln technology, establishing three disposal lines to reduce HW volumes, develop renewable products, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and conserve resources. To optimise the HW disposal process, a multi-objective optimisation model comprehensively considering social, economic, and environmental dimensions is proposed. Then a numerical example is used to demonstrated the validity of the proposed model and a real-world case is conducted to demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of the proposed model in determining the most suitable hazardous waste disposal facilities, transportation routes and transportation quantities. Scenario analyses under different decision-maker attitudes towards the objectives are conducted while also considering the influence of governmental disposal subsidies. Finally, practical policy suggestions are provided to guide scientific and sustainable HW disposal. This study concludes that 1) different decision maker and disposal subsidy levels affect the optimal system decisions, 2) advanced co-processing in cement kiln technology increases the effectiveness of the HW-RLN in terms of economic and environmental perspectives, and 3) policy subsidy support could encourage the application of co-processing in cement kiln technology; a unit disposal subsidy of 160 CNY is considered suitable for ""technologically pessimistic"" decision-makers, while 200-220 CNY is considered suitable for ""technologically optimistic"" decision-makers.

We built a macro-level dataset for the top 25 ranked logistics countries from 2007 to 2018, conducting a set of panel data tests on cross-sectional dependence, stationarity and cointegration, to provide preliminary insights. Empirical estimates from Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS), Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), and Quantile Regression (QR) model suggest that technological innovation, Human Development Index (HDI), urbanization, and trade openness significantly boost logistic performance, whereas employment and Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) fail to respond in such a desirable path. In turn, an increase in the Logistic Performance Index (LPI) is found to worsen economic growth. Finally, LPI exhibits a large positive effect on carbon emissions, which is congruent with a strand of the literature highlighting that the modern supply chain is far from being decarbonized.

The objective of this paper is to identify the stakeholders' requirements and critical success factors (CSFs) for the sustainability initiative in SC during this pandemic situation. Three potential stakeholders' requirements and a total of 16 critical success factors have been identified by taking inputs from experts and decision-makers. Further, these critical factors are analyzed and ranked based on a hybrid quality function deployment (QFD)-best-worst methodology (BWM). The QFD method has been used to identify the stakeholder' requirements. And, the BWM has been adopted to prioritize the CSFs. The scientific value of the study is the contribution of the framework model for the sustainable initiatives in the SC during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, identification of stakeholders' requirements and CSFs, and prioritizes these CSFs. The top three most critical success factors are found to be social distancing, emergency logistics systems, and emergency backup facilities. The proposed framework provides a madmap to operation and supply chain managers to come up with good solutions for sustainability initiatives in the supply chain during and after the pandemic outbreak.;Natl Inst Technol Patna, Dept Mech Engn, Patna 800005, Bihar, India;National Institute of Technology (NIT System);0739-8859;2022;10.1016/j.retrec.2021.101114;WOS:000828656300005;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  30', 'Total Times Cited:  30', 'Cited Reference Count:  94'];JUN;93;;;;101114;JUN 2022;;-1;Issues and analysis of critical success factors for the sustainable initiatives in the supply chain during COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in India: A case study;"10.1016/j.retrec.2021.101114

Additionally, the study has also examined the moderating role of long-term orientation between social sustainability performance and socially sustainable supply chain practices. The results of the study are different from the previous researches in different ways. Operational performance cannot be improved through the implementation of basic social sustainable supply chain practices. Innovation can be suppressed by basic practices in this way. The operational outcomes can improve through the use of advanced social sustainable supply chain practices. Moreover, it influences the operational performance positively. The results are consistent with the previous research, which supports that change in product design and the process can result in improved learning for the organization. In this research, the specific practices and their influence created on the operational performance have been defined, which makes it different from the previous researches. The use of advanced SSSC practices needs coordination and improved strategic planning in the supply chain. The operational outcomes of the firm can improve as well. The study has contributed to long term orientation and social sustainable performance theory regarding the second research question. The use of advanced practices enables the positive influence of sustainability orientation on the firm's operational performance. It has been found that the use of advanced practices results in operational benefits but there is a need for further analysis from the aspect of basic practices. It is important to invest in advanced practices that may require more resources but result in improved operational performance. Disciplinary: Management Sciences (Sustainable Management).

Federal and state policies increasingly require plans to assess and incorporate EJ principles. The current lack of accessible data and plan evaluation on EJ has been a barrier to policy setting and benchmarking. We created a framework for analyzing content across a large corpus of plans by using quantitative text analysis on 461 California city general plans, also known as comprehensive plans. To verify results and identify specific policies, we conducted content analysis on a subset of seven plans. Demonstrating the broad applicability of EJ principles in planning, policies spanned all required elements of general plans: housing, circulation, land use, health, safety, open space, air quality, and noise. We found that the most headway in EJ planning has been made in cities with a majority population of color and well before the 2018 California state mandate to address EJ. Policies were primarily focused on preventing adverse exposures as opposed to correcting for legacies of inequality. Further, although all policies address vulnerable populations and places, very few specifically address race or racism. Thus, EJ has been largely operationalized as health equity.Takeaway for practiceWe identified 628 EJ policies focused on vulnerable populations across the seven city plans included in content analysis. The smorgasbord of policy approaches provides fodder for cities across the United States to incorporate an EJ approach to planning. Gaps in focus areas reveal room for policy innovation (e.g., emphasis on language justice, formerly incarcerated individuals, and noise ordinance policing). We invite planners and community advocates to search across California's plans for EJ policy inspiration and to use the appendix of EJ policies cataloged in this research as a benchmark of city-level innovation.;Ctr Reg Change, Davis, CA 95616 USA;University of California System;0194-4363;2024;WOS:000888530100001;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  18', 'Total Times Cited:  20', 'Cited Reference Count:  87'];JAN 2;90;10.1080/01944363.2022.2118155;;1;63;76;NOV 2022;;-1;Who Is Planning for Environmental Justice-and How?;"10.1080/01944363.2022.2118155

16;16;JOUR;Investigating the partnership approach in the EU Urban Agenda from the perspective of soft planning;EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES;English;['European spatial planning', 'governance', 'housing partnership', 'urban planning', 'European Union', 'urban development', 'EUROPEAN SPATIAL DEVELOPMENT', 'TERRITORIAL COHESION', 'SPACES', 'POLICY'];At the European level, several strategic documents concerned with spatial and urban development have been published during the last decades. While these documents are essential to communicate European ideas and objectives, they are often regarded least influential in practice due to their abstract nature, legally non-binding status and lack of allocated resources. Though these limitations apply to the EU Urban Agenda, this recently published policy paper introduces partnerships as a new implementation tool. The partnerships can be regarded as innovative in two respects: On the one hand, they involve new actors, most importantly cities, in European policy debates. On the other hand, they ensure the anchorage of the Urban Agenda with a broad range of actors at various spatial scales without challenging its legally non-binding status. The Urban Agenda can thus be understood as another example of the move towards soft European spatial planning and urban development. This article investigates the notion of partnership as a soft planning and governance tool within the Urban Agenda. Moreover, based on expert interviews, it presents early opinions and expectations of actors involved in the development of the Urban Agenda and the partnerships on affordable housing.;Aalto Univ, Dept Built Environm, POB 14100, FIN-00076 Espoo, Finland;Aalto University;0965-4313;2019;WOS:000456423100005;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  19', 'Total Times Cited:  20', 'Cited Reference Count:  66'];;27;10.1080/09654313.2018.1527294;;1;86;105;;;-1;Investigating the partnership approach in the EU Urban Agenda from the perspective of soft planning;"10.1080/09654313.2018.1527294

A study conducted by the Swiss organization IQAir indicated that 22 of the top 30 most polluted cities in the world are in India. This creates the problem of air pollution, which is very relevant to India as well. Exposure to air pollutants has both acute (short-term) and chronic (long-term) impacts on health. Among the major air pollutants, particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) is the most harmful, and its long-term exposure can impair lung functions. Pollutant concentrations vary temporally and are dependent on the local meteorology and emissions at a given geographic location. PM2.5 forecasting models have the potential to develop strategies for evaluating and alerting the public regarding expected hazardous levels of air pollution. Accurate measurement and forecasting of pollutant concentrations are critical for assessing air quality and making informed strategic decisions. Recently, data-driven machine learning algorithms for PM2.5 forecasting have received a lot of attention. In this work, a spatio-temporal analysis of air quality was first performed for Hyderabad, indicating that average PM2.5 concentrations during the winter were 68% higher than those during the summer. Following that, PM2.5 modelling was done using three different techniques: multilinear regression, K-nearest neighbours (KNN), and histogram-based gradient boost (HGBoost). Among these, the HGBoost regression model, which used both pollution and meteorological data as inputs, outperformed the other two techniques. During testing, the model acquired an amazing R-2 value of 0.859, suggesting a significant connection with the actual data. Additionally, the model exhibited a minimum Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 5.717 & mu;g/m(3) and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 7.647 & mu;g/m(3), further confirming its accuracy in predicting PM2.5 concentrations. In our investigation, we discovered that the HGBoost3 model beat other PM2.5 modelling models by having the lowest error and the highest R-2 value. This study made a substantial addition by incorporating the spatiotemporal relationship between air pollutants and meteorological variables in predicting air quality. This method has the potential to improve the creation of more precise air pollution forecast models.";Tartous Univ, Fac Arts & Humanities, Geog Dept, Tartous 2147, Syria;Tartous University;2331-1916;2023;WOS:001047492500001;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  13', 'Total Times Cited:  13', 'Cited Reference Count:  41'];DEC 31;10;10.1080/23311916.2023.2243743;2243743;1;;;;;-1;Air quality analysis and PM2.5 modelling using machine learning techniques: A study of Hyderabad city in India;"10.1080/23311916.2023.2243743

22;22;JOUR;Towards accelerating the adoption of zero emissions cargo handling technologies in California ports: Lessons learned from the case of the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach;JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION;English;['Net-zero emissions', 'Sustainable circular strategy', 'Cargo handling equipment', 'Automation', 'Port sustainability', 'Port of Long Beach', 'Port of Los Angeles', 'POLICY', 'SUSTAINABILITY', 'AUTOMATION', 'VEHICLES'];There is a growing global trend towards achieving net-zero emissions of greenhouse gases from port operations as consumers and governments become increasingly aware of the impacts of global climate change and ongoing environmental justice issues. However, the existing literature on the topic of zero-emissions ports is broad-based and focuses mainly on technology feasibility. Specifically, it provides insufficient guidance on how ports can best transition to zero emissions. To address this research gap, this review article examines the ongoing zero emissions planning documents and demonstration projects at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach and presents the key lessons learned from those efforts to accelerate the adoption of zero-emissions cargo handling equipment in California. Increasingly, the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are emerging as leaders with a sustainable circular strategy by implementing zero-emissions cargo handling equipment projects at a higher rate than any other ports in California, making these two ports an ideal case study to evaluate their endeavors to transition their operations to zero emissions. The findings of this review study suggest that transitioning to zero emissions cargo handling equipment across all California ports by 2035 is best achievable with: 1) a stronger collaboration between all key stakeholders, 2) the development of statewide regulations, 3) accelerated technology commercialization through increased demonstration projects and infrastructure standardization, 4) improved funding processes, 5) enhanced workforce training, and 6) increased resiliency planning. Although this evaluation and recommendations are largely California-specific, this article can be useful to policy-and decision makers around the world for transitioning to sustainable, net-zero emissions ports.;Calif State Univ, Maritime Acad, 200 Maritime Dr, Vallejo, CA 94590 USA;;0959-6526;2022;WOS:000789605000002;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  21', 'Total Times Cited:  22', 'Cited Reference Count:  87'];MAY 1;347;10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.131255;131255;;;;MAR 2022;;-1;Towards accelerating the adoption of zero emissions cargo handling technologies in California ports: Lessons learned from the case of the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach;"10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.131255

It examines how environmental improvement in one place may lead to environmental degradation in another place, how geographic concepts such as location, distance, spread and backwash effects, and land use models can help understand such phenomenon, and what the implications are for the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) and development policies. Field research was conducted from 2006 to 2012 in Chinese cities of Beijing, Dalian, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuxi, Hangzhou, and Ningbo. It involved intensive site observations and in-depth interviews with government officials of environmental protection, economic development, and business recruitment, and grassroots environmentalists. The results indicate that environmental improvement in all these cities has led to environmental degradation in their suburbs and rural areas due to relocation of polluting plants. Environmental spread and backwash effects may help explain the severe intra-regional environmental and economic disparities and environmental injustice. The powerful and wealthy may achieve rapid economic growth and environmental recovery at the expenses of the powerless and poor, leading to environmental poverty and sustainability disparities.

Also, a Demand Response Program (DRP) based on TOU pricing has been implemented to improve the profits of power producers and the energy consumption pattern of end customers. Decision variables included the price of conventional and renewable energy during low- and high-load periods, tax rate, and subsidies. These variables are determined in three scenarios with the goals of maximizing government revenue, maximizing social welfare, minimizing environmental impacts, and under two-game structures of cooperative and Nash between the producers. The equilibrium solutions of each game for the three scenarios were obtained by backward induction. The results showed that decisions related to energy prices and tariffs play a major role in achieving the goals of sustainable development, profits of supply chain members, and success in meeting consumer demand. For all three scenarios, the government revenue function and the social welfare functions earn higher values in the Nash game than in the cooperative game, but the environmental impacts and the producers' profit function earn respectively lower and higher values in the cooperative game.

The tradeoff between engine efficiency and NO, emissions is an intrinsic property that prevents modern Diesel engines, which are generally equipped with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and variable geometry turbocharger (VGT), from achieving the optimal engine efficiency while meeting the stringent NO, emission standards. The addition of urea-based selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems to modern Diesel engine aftertreatment systems alleviate the burden of NOx emission control on Diesel engines, which in return creates extra freedom for optimizing Diesel engine efficiency. This paper proposes two model-based approaches to locate the optimal operating point of EGR and VGT in the air-path loop to maximize the indicated efficiency of turbocharged diesel engine. Simulation results demonstrated that the engine brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) can be reduced by up to 1.6% through optimization of EGR and VGT, compared to a baseline EGR-VGT control which considers both NO, emissions and engine efficiency on engine side. The overall equivalent BSFCs are 1.8% higher with optimized EGR and VGT control than with the baseline control. In addition, the influence of reducing EGR valve opening on the non-minimum phase behavior of the air path loop is also analyzed Simulation results showed slightly stronger non-minimum phase behaviors when EGR is fully closed.;Tennessee Technol Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Cookeville, TN 38505 USA;Tennessee Technological University;978-0-7918-5934-6;2020;WOS:000518237600053;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0', 'Total Times Cited:  0', 'Cited Reference Count:  19'];;;;V001T05A007;;;;;"['[', ""'"", '[', ""'"", ',', '', '""', ""'"", '""', ',', '', ""'"", 'A', ""'"", ',', '', ""'"", 'S', ""'"", ',', '', ""'"", 'M', ""'"", ',', '', ""'"", 'E', ""'"", ',', '', '""', ""'"", '""', ',', '', ""'"", ']', ""'"", ']']";-1;OPTIMIZATION OF ENGINE EFFICIENCY FOR DIESEL ENGINE EQUIPPED WITH EGR-VGT AND AFTERTREATMENT SYSTEMS;;"Exhaust gas recirculation; variable-geometry turbocharger; selective catalytic reduction; optimization; CATALYTIC-REDUCTION SYSTEM; PREDICTIVE CONTROL; MODEL; DESIGN"

The growth in importance of social sustainability represents a strategic change in the sector with the necessary involvement of different tiers and external stakeholders to mitigate the negative social impacts. In this paper, a qualitative analysis through the application of content analysis using NVivo software is carried out, first to identify the structure and the main entities in this supply chain, and then to understand the main drivers towards social sustainability management. Six global companies were analysed, considering their sustainability reports from 2014 to 2018. The findings showed that social sustainability is a part of strategic goals as policies and commitments, and several actions have been developed along the supply chain to promote human rights, labour conditions, social development, and product responsibility, with external stakeholders collaboration. Finally, this article contributes to understanding how social sustainability should be managed in the apparel sector in a global supply chain context. Furthermore, in order to enrich the knowledge on this field, this paper provides some insight throughout the definition of a roadmap for future research in the area. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

70;70;JOUR;Towards sustainable ships: Advancing energy efficiency of HVAC systems onboard through digital twin;ENERGY;English;['Ship energy modelling', 'Digital twin', 'Energy management', 'HVAC systems', 'CII assessment', 'MODELS'];Digital twin technology has proven effective for optimizing the energy performance of various ship systems, particularly in power and energy management. However, its application has not extended to HVAC systems. This study introduces a novel framework based on a dynamic simulation tool that accounts for the transient thermal conditions of the ship. It enables the assessment of thermal loads, energy needs, and HVAC system design, along with evaluating of the energy performance across different configurations. The tool can function as a digital twin onboard ship equipped with IoT sensors, providing real-time energy performance monitoring and optimization. Beyond offering swift energy, economic, and environmental analyses, it also allows for real-time adjustments to enhance energy efficiency. The framework integrates a 3D geometrical model of the ship into an energy performance dynamic simulation model. It incorporates actual operating conditions, including real ship load profiles, hourly weather parameters, and the ship's location and orientation. A proof-of-concept demonstration of this framework is provided for a medium-sized ship, with a detailed geometrical model that includes 1595 thermal zones and accommodates 1750 passengers and 880 crew members. The reference scenario explores a typical HVAC system, while five different interventions and six different combinations are explored. The results highlight potential fuel savings ranging from 0.17% (-45.95 t/y) for setpoint temperature attenuation to 1.50% (-0.411 kt/y) for the combination of setpoint temperature reconfiguration with variable external fresh air based on usage-based criteria.;Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Ind Engn, Ple Tecchio 80, I-80125 Naples, Italy;University of Naples Federico II;0360-5442;2025;WOS:001421519300001;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0', 'Total Times Cited:  0', 'Cited Reference Count:  60'];FEB 15;317;10.1016/j.energy.2025.134435;134435;;;;;;-1;Towards sustainable ships: Advancing energy efficiency of HVAC systems onboard through digital twin;"10.1016/j.energy.2025.134435

Nonetheless, planning and management in Hawai'i, a state with highly valued natural capital, has yet to broadly utilize an ecosystem service approach. We conducted a stakeholder assessment, based on semi-structured interviews, with terrestrial (n = 26) and marine (n = 27) natural resource managers across the State of Hawai'i to understand the current use of ecosystem services (ES) knowledge and decision support tools and whether, how, and under what contexts, further development would potentially be useful. We found that ES knowledge and tools customized to Hawai'i could be useful for communication and outreach, justifying management decisions, and spatial planning. Greater incorporation of this approach is clearly desired and has a strong potential to contribute to more sustainable decision making and planning in Hawai'i and other oceanic island systems. However, the unique biophysical, socio-economic, and cultural context of Hawai'i, and other island systems, will require substantial adaptation of existing ES tools.

81;81;JOUR;An imperative to focus the plastic pollution problem on place-based solutions;FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABILITY;English;['Australia', 'circular economy', 'place-based solutions', 'plastic', 'plastic supply chain', 'reverse logistics'];There is an increased focus on plastic pollution and the resultant harms in our oceans and on our shores at local, regional, and global scales. New technologies are being developed and trialed, multilateral agreements are coming into play, and the role of a circular economy is increasingly touted as the key to help solve the plastic pollution crisis. Simultaneously, we are witnessing the disruption of global supply chains from the COVID-19 pandemic, increased fuel prices and increased scope and scale of natural disasters. Individual countries are setting national targets and are developing national plans of action to combat plastic pollution. In this paper, we focus on Australia's National Plastics Plan as a case study of a national approach to addressing this transboundary issue. We discuss the Plan in relation to supply chains, the role of standards and best practices, and principles for a successful circular plastic economy. We explicitly consider the role of reverse logistics and regional approaches that could be developed and implemented within island nations. Overall, we argue for culturally appropriate, economically and environmentally place-based solutions as a necessary approach to help reduce plastic losses to the environment, acknowledging that plastics leakage to the environment is a social equity issue.;CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas, Australia;Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO);2673-4524;2022;WOS:001269578200001;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6', 'Total Times Cited:  6', 'Cited Reference Count:  54'];OCT 14;3;10.3389/frsus.2022.963432;963432;;;;;;-1;An imperative to focus the plastic pollution problem on place-based solutions;"10.3389/frsus.2022.963432

Current business models for EV ownership and the transition to net-net zero emissions are not working for households in the lowest income brackets. However, low-income communities bear the brunt of environmental and health illnesses from transport air pollution caused by those living in relatively more affluent areas. Importantly, achieving equitable EV ownership amongst low-and middle-income households and driving policy goals towards environmental injustice of air pollution and net-zero emissions would require responsible and circular business models. Such consumer-focused business models address an EV subscription via low-income household tax rebates, an EV battery value-chain circularity, locally-driven new battery technological development, including EV manufacturing tax rebates and socially innovative mechanisms. This brief communication emphasises that consumer-led business models following net-zero emission vehicles shift and decisions must ensure positive-sum outcomes.

These data-driven approaches primarily aim to enhance model-based inertial sensing algorithms. To foster further research on integrating deep learning with inertial navigation and sensor fusion, and to leverage their potential, this paper presents an indepth review of deep learning methods in the context of inertial sensing and sensor fusion. We explore learning techniques for calibration and denoising, as well as strategies for improving pure inertial navigation and sensor fusion by learning some of the fusion filter parameters. The reviewed approaches are categorized based on the operational environments of the vehicles-land, air, and sea.

Design/methodology/approach This paper advances the development of a hypothetical, systems-based approach to the design and development of smart rural villages - a network of circular economy villages (CEVs). The method is to assimilate visionary ideas from 20th century town planning literature related to decentralisation and the development of new towns in rural areas, identifying key design principles. The present trajectory of infrastructure design and emerging development models are then analysed to modernise the design principles for implementation in the 21st century. Findings The availability of localised, renewable energy micro-grids potentially makes CEVs feasible and affordable. The shift to remote work and movement of people to regional areas suggests that this may be a desirable development form. This can only be confirmed through the development of a pilot project as proof of concept. Originality/value The proposed CEV development model applies circular economy strategies to every aspect of the smart rural village development including financing, ownership, spatial planning, design and material selection.;Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia;University of Sydney;2044-124X;2022;WOS:000679409800001;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8', 'Total Times Cited:  10', 'Cited Reference Count:  31'];MAY 11;12;10.1108/BEPAM-01-2021-0004;;3;349;364;JUL 2021;;-1;A network of circular economy villages: design guidelines for 21st century Garden Cities;"10.1108/BEPAM-01-2021-0004

115;115;JOUR;Inland waterway efficiency through skipper collaboration and joint speed optimization;EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH;English;['Scheduling', 'Congestion', 'Social welfare', 'Mechanism design', 'Online scheduling'];We address the problem of minimizing the aggregated fuel consumption by the vessels in an inland waterway, e.g., a river, with a single lock. The fuel consumption of a vessel depends on its velocity and the slower it moves, the less fuel it consumes. Given entry times of the vessels into the waterway and the deadlines before which they need to leave the waterway, we start from the optimal velocities of the vessels that minimize their private fuel consumption, where we assume selfish behavior of the skippers. Presence of the lock and possible congestion on the waterway make the problem computationally challenging. First, we prove that in general, a Nash equilibrium might not exist, i.e., if there is no supervision on the vessels' velocities, there might not exist a strategy profile from which no vessel can unilaterally deviate to decrease its private fuel consumption. Next, we introduce simple supervision methods to guarantee the existence of a Nash equilibrium. Unfortunately, though a Nash equilibrium can be computed, the aggregated fuel consumption of such a stable solution can be high compared to the social optimum, where the total fuel consumption is minimized. Therefore, we propose a mechanism involving payments between vessels, guaranteeing a Nash equilibrium while minimizing the fuel consumption. This mechanism is studied for both the offline setting, where all information is known beforehand, and online setting, where we only know the entry time and deadline of a vessel when it enters the waterway.

This research develops a multi-objective mathematical model to configure a Sustainable Closed-Loop Supply Chain (SCLSC) network for a water tank considering sustainability measures. The goals of the proposed model are optimizing financial, environmental and social impacts of the SCLSC. Generally, the uncertainty exists in configuring the SCLSC network problem according to the changes in the business environment (like transportation costs and demand). As a result, a Fuzzy Robust Optimization (FRO) is applied to cope with uncertainty in this study. Then, the proposed model is solved using the goal programming approach. The numerical results showed some insightful observations regarding planning and strategic decisions for the SCLSC network design.

It is difficult to assess the land use types in these fast-growing cities in a timely and accurate way. To address this problem, this paper presents a multi-source data mining approach to study dynamic urban land use patterns. Spatiotemporal social media data reveal human activity patterns in different areas, social media text data reflects the topics discussed in different areas, and Points of Interest (POI) reflect the distribution of urban facilities in different regions. Human activity patterns, topics of discussion on social media, and the distribution of urban facilities in different regions were combined and analyzed to infer urban land use patterns. We collected 9.5 million geo-tagged Chinese social media (Sina-Weibo) messages from January 2014 to July 2014 in the urban core areas of Beijing and compared them with 385,792 commercial Points of Interest (POI) from Datatang (a Chinese digital data content provider). To estimate urban land use types and patterns in Beijing, a regular grid of 400 m x 400 m was created to divide the urban core areas into 18,492 cells. By analyzing the temporal frequency trends of social media messages within each cell using K-means clustering algorithm, we identified seven types of land use clusters in Beijing: residential areas, university dormitories, commercial areas, work areas, transportation hubs, and two types of mixed land use areas. Text mining, word clouds, and the distribution analysis of POI were used to verify the estimated land use types successfully.

Accordingly, there is a fundamental need for assisting companies in the transition to Industry 4.0 technologies/practices, and guiding them for improving their capabilities in a standardized, objective, and repeatable way. Maturity Models (MMs) aim to assist organizations by providing comprehensive guidance. Therefore, the literature is reviewed systematically with the aim of identifying existing studies related to MMs proposed in the context of Industry 4.0. Seven identified MMs are analyzed by comparing their characteristics of scope, purpose, completeness, clearness, and objectivity. It is concluded that none of them satisfies all expected criteria. In order to satisfy the need for a structured Industry 4.0 assessment/maturity model, SPICE-based Industry 4.0-MM is proposed in this study.

The circular economy provides a framework and set of principles for achieving sustainable growth. By adopting circular practices, such as resource efficiency, recycling, and product life extension, economic activities can become more sustainable and contribute to long-term growth. In today's world, consumers have high expectations for companies to be accountable for the environmental and social impact of their products and services. The implementation of Total Quality Management (TQM) in manufacturing can contribute to sustainable growth by enhancing quality, reducing waste, and increasing efficiency. This study proposes a novel methodological framework to establish a comprehensive association between Juran's ten quality principles using a mixed-method sequential approach with an integrated Machine Learning Group Decision-Making (MLGDM) and Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM)-DEMATEL approach. The framework involves using the MLGDM approach to select the optimal number of experts to develop contextual relationships among the principles. This framework is designed to address the challenge of determining the appropriate number of experts to involve in the decision-making process. Involving too few experts can limit the generalizability of the results, while having too many experts can lead to a high degree of inconsistency and make it challenging to reach a consensus. The MLGDM portion of our framework provides a systematic approach to overcome this challenge and helps supply chain managers and academicians implement quality practices in their organizations. Moreover, although several studies have explored the implementation of TQM practices, there is still a lack of a systematic framework that can fully incorporate Juran's quality principles. To fill this gap, the ISM-DEMATEL approach was then used to explore the causal relationships between these principles. Practitioners from the industry were asked to identify contextual associations among variables, which facilitated a better understanding of these principles. Our results suggest that ""Build awareness,"" ""Set goals for improvement,"" and ""Provide training"" are strategic requirements for successful TQM implementation, while ""Carry out projects to solve problems,"" ""Organize to reach the goals,"" and ""Keep score"" are tactical requirements. Furthermore, ""Communicate results,"" ""Report progress,"" ""Give recognition,"" and ""Maintain momentum"" are operational necessities for TQM implementation.

The subject of supply chain sustainability, simultaneously considering economic, environment and/or social values, has gained attention in the academia and from the industry. Particularly for deteriorating and seasonal products, such as fresh produce, the issues of timely supply and disposal of the deteriorated products are of high concerns. This research develops a new replenishment policy in a centralized sustainable supply chain for the deteriorating items. The model considers inventory and transportation costs, as well as the environmental and social impacts, with several transportation vehicles producing various pollution and greenhouse gas levels. Some variables are uncertain as the end-customer demand, partial backordered ratio and deterioration rate. We also consider backorders, quantity discount prices, non-linear holding costs, multiple transportation-route options, and uncertain demand. We consider the deterioration of in-stock inventory. and the deterioration during transportation. The best transportation routes and vehicles, and inventory policy are determined by finding a balance between financial, environmental and social criteria. We develop a linear multi-objective mathematical model and present a numerical example to demonstrate its applicability and effectiveness.

196;196;CPAPER;Public-Private Partnership and the Development of Transport Infrastructure in Poland: The Analysis of Critical Success Factors;TRANSPORT DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY;English;['PPP', 'Critical success factors', 'Transport', 'PPP in Poland'];Efficient transport is an important determinant of the integration of the EU countries. TEN-T has been created by the European Commission to ensure the mobility of citizens, as well as fast and safe trading. However, the European transport infrastructure is characterized by large variations on the level of development that occurs in the East and West of the EU. In Poland, the infrastructure is technically unadjusted to the current transport needs and preferences. Modernization and development of infrastructure requires large capital expenditures. At the same time the public finance sector is overloaded, and the budget deficit is common. European countries and governments around the world are more likely to engage the private sector to finance infrastructure. The usual form of involvement of private investors is the public-private partnership (PPP). However, not all projects are successful. Achieving tangible benefits of PPP requires the creation of appropriate conditions conducive to its implementation. The aim of this study is to identify and analyze critical success factors for PPP transport infrastructure projects in Poland. The research literature proves that there are many factors and they relate to various aspects and stages of the PPP implementation. The factors are classified in four groups: financial and economic, political and legal, technical, and social. The ones that have significant impact on transport infrastructure include: stable macroeconomic situation of the country, political support and commitment of the government, legal system, well-organized public consulting agencies, financial market availability, credible and experienced private investors. In Poland, the most important factors that are necessary for success in the implementation of PPP projects are: support of the government and governmental institutions, legal framework and regulations and the existence of adequate public advisory bodies. For the past 20 years, these conditions have not been fully met and formed a barrier to the development of the partnership. The consequence of the lack of public advisory body is limited knowledge on PPP in public administration as well as in banks, which in the case of the latter, limits the availability of the financial market for private partners.;Kazimierz Pulaski Univ Technol & Humanities Radom, Fac Transport & Elect Engn, PL-26600 Radom, Poland;Kazimierz Pulaski University of Technology & Humanities in Radom;2198-7246;2016;WOS:000386325500012;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0', 'Total Times Cited:  0', 'Cited Reference Count:  29'];;;10.1007/978-3-319-26848-4_12;;;125;138;;;-1;Public-Private Partnership and the Development of Transport Infrastructure in Poland: The Analysis of Critical Success Factors;"10.1007/978-3-319-26848-4_12

207;207;JOUR;Digital Twin and Reinforcement Learning-Based Resilient Production Control for Micro Smart Factory;APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL;English;['digital twin', 'production control', 'micro smart factory', 'modular manufacturing system', 'resilience', 'reinforcement learning', 'SYSTEM'];"To achieve efficient personalized production at an affordable cost, a modular manufacturing system (MMS) can be utilized. MMS enables restructuring of its configuration to accommodate product changes and is thus an efficient solution to reduce the costs involved in personalized production. A micro smart factory (MSF) is an MMS with heterogeneous production processes to enable personalized production. Similar to MMS, MSF also enables the restructuring of production configuration; additionally, it comprises cyber-physical production systems (CPPSs) that help achieve resilience. However, MSFs need to overcome performance hurdles with respect to production control. Therefore, this paper proposes a digital twin (DT) and reinforcement learning (RL)-based production control method. This method replaces the existing dispatching rule in the type and instance phases of the MSF. In this method, the RL policy network is learned and evaluated by coordination between DT and RL. The DT provides virtual event logs that include states, actions, and rewards to support learning. These virtual event logs are returned based on vertical integration with the MSF. As a result, the proposed method provides a resilient solution to the CPPS architectural framework and achieves appropriate actions to the dynamic situation of MSF. Additionally, applying DT with RL helps decide what-next/where-next in the production cycle. Moreover, the proposed concept can be extended to various manufacturing domains because the priority rule concept is frequently applied.";Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Suwon 16419, South Korea;Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU);2076-3417;2021;WOS:000638329400001;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  32', 'Total Times Cited:  33', 'Cited Reference Count:  55'];APR;11;10.3390/app11072977;2977;7;;;;;-1;Digital Twin and Reinforcement Learning-Based Resilient Production Control for Micro Smart Factory;"10.3390/app11072977

Since the 3PL service is mainly dependent on both transport vehicles and employees, managing them from the viewpoint of social sustainability has become a critical issue. Thus, 3PL providers need to be concerned about not only the service price or quality but also issues related to social sustainability. In line with this trend, we defined the social sustainability of 3PL providers and related evaluation criteria. In addition, a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used as a main evaluation framework to help decision-makers determine the relative importance of each criteria or alternative using linguistic terms. To show the feasibility of the proposed criteria and evaluation framework, we presented the illustrative example based on a real-world case. The results showed that the proposed approach could be a good alternative to conduct evaluations, and the related sensitivity analysis, considering social sustainability.;Inha Univ, Asia Pacific Sch Logist, 100 Inha Ro, Incheon 402751, South Korea;Inha University;2071-1050;2017;WOS:000404127800102;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  34', 'Total Times Cited:  36', 'Cited Reference Count:  108'];MAY;9;10.3390/su9050777;777;5;;;;;-1;Evaluation of Third Party Logistics Providers Considering Social Sustainability;"10.3390/su9050777

At end-of-life (EoL), these batteries must be managed properly to maximize reuse and recycling, which requires an efficient and safe collection and transportation system; however, the logistics of transporting EoL batteries are rarely examined in depth in scholarly research. In this paper, we conduct a critical review of the peer-reviewed literature on EV traction battery reuse and recycling to assess how transportation is represented. We find that among 60 studies identified, 70% mentioned collection and transportation as a challenge to battery reuse or recycling, and 63% identified a need for policy or further research related to collection and transportation. Among 17 papers that focus on cost, estimates for transportation costs vary widely among studies, from more than five dollars per kg to less than 30 cents, representing, on average, 41% of the total cost of recycling. Studies that examined the environmental impact of EoL transportation suggest it contributes 1-3.5% of life cycle GHG emissions for a recycled battery. In response to the limited and highly variable treatment of battery EoL transportation, the literature review is followed by contextual information about the United States, including the regulatory framework and existing network for EoL batteries. Recommendations for future study include place-specific research on optimal facility siting that considers both existing and projected infrastructure, and which reflects costs and environmental and social impacts at local scales.";Univ Calif Davis, Energy Syst Energy & Efficiency Inst, 1605 Tilia St 100, Davis, CA 95616 USA;University of California System;0921-3449;2021;WOS:000672683700015;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  86', 'Total Times Cited:  93', 'Cited Reference Count:  73'];NOV;174;10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.105755;105755;;;;JUL 2021;;-1;Transportation of electric vehicle lithium-ion batteries at end-of-life: A literature review;"10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.105755

The service free-riding is considered, and the channel price difference is also introduced as a strategic tool to adjust the channel conflict. In centralized and decentralized models, we give the optimal decisions of the supply chain members and analyse the effects of the service free-riding and the price difference on the related decisions. In order to coordinate the dual-channel green supply chain, we also design a two-part tariff contract coordination model, which allows both the manufacturer and the retailer to obtain a win-win result. From the analytical and numerical results, we find that the proper service free-riding degree and price difference are beneficial to the decision makers and the greening of supply chain. And in the centralized model, when the degree of service free-riding is small, the increase of the channel price difference can stimulate the manufacturer to provide the lower price product with lower service and green degree, otherwise, it is the opposite. Besides, the result also shows that, except for consumers, the centralized model always performs better than the decentralized model in the profit and social welfare aspects.;Tianjin Univ, Sch Math, Tianjin, Peoples R China;Tianjin University;0233-1934;2022;WOS:000565380500001;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  24', 'Total Times Cited:  25', 'Cited Reference Count:  42'];MAR 4;71;10.1080/02331934.2020.1812064;;3;633;674;AUG 2020;;-1;Product green degree, service free-riding, strategic price difference in a dual-channel supply chain based on dynamic game;"10.1080/02331934.2020.1812064

Ordinary Least Square (OLS) was employed to test the direct effects, while Hayes Process Macros was employed to test the indirect and conditional effects among the study variables using a structural equation modelling approach.FindingsThe results showed that SSCMP has a direct positive effect on PERFOP. The study further revealed that BRC mediates the relationship between SSCMP and PERFOP. This study found that BRC negatively moderates the association between SSCMP and PERFOP, suggesting that high levels of BRC generate unintended adverse effect on the SSCMP- PERFOP link. However, the results revealed that CSC serves as a boundary condition to BRC.Originality/valueTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that emphasizes how the resource-based view and regulatory focus theory interact to explain how different degrees of CSC and BRC impact SSCMP performance outcomes.

These operations have increased due to the growth of electronic commerce and direct-to-consumer strategies. We propose a novel data- and model-driven framework to support decision making for urban distribution. The methodology is composed of diverse, hybrid, and complementary techniques integrated by a decision support system. This approach focuses on key elements of megacities such as socio-demographic diversity, portfolio mix, logistics fragmentation, high congestion factors, and dense commercial areas. The methodological framework will allow decision makers to create early warning systems and, with the implementation of optimization, machine learning, and simulation models together, make the best utilization of resources. The advantages of the system include flexibility in decision making, social welfare, increased productivity, and reductions in cost and environmental impacts. A real-world illustrative example is presented under conditions in one of the most congested cities: the megacity of Bogota, Colombia. Data come from a retail organization operating in the city. A network of stakeholders is analyzed to understand the complex urban distribution. The execution of the methodology was capable of solving a complex problem reducing the number of vehicles utilized, increasing the resource capacity utilization, and reducing the cost of operations of the fleet, meeting all constraints. These constraints included the window of operations and accomplishing the total number of deliveries. Furthermore, the methodology could accomplish the learning function using deep reinforcement learning in reasonable computational times. This preliminary analysis shows the potential benefits, especially in understudied metropolitan areas from emerging markets, supporting a more effective delivery process, and encouraging proactive, dynamic decision making during the execution stage.;MIT, Ctr Latin American Logist Innovat, Global SCALE Network, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA;Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT);2071-1050;2021;WOS:000660763000001;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  35', 'Total Times Cited:  38', 'Cited Reference Count:  111'];JUN;13;10.3390/su13116230;6230;11;;;;;-1;Data-Driven Methodology to Support Long-Lasting Logistics and Decision Making for Urban Last-Mile Operations;"10.3390/su13116230

322;322;JOUR;Improving Sustainable Safe Transport via Automated Vehicle Control with Closed-Loop Matching;SUSTAINABILITY;English;['vehicle control', 'closed-loop matching', 'control-oriented modeling', 'neural networks'];"The concept of vehicle automation is a promising approach to achieve sustainable transport systems, especially in an urban context. Automation requires the integration of learning-based approaches and methods in control theory. Through the integration, a high amount of information in automation can be incorporated. Thus, a sustainable operation, i.e., energy-efficient and safe motion with automated vehicles, can be achieved. Despite the advantages of integration with learning-based approaches, enhanced vehicle automation poses crucial safety challenges. In this paper, a novel closed-loop matching method for control-oriented purposes in the context of vehicle control systems is presented. The goal of the method is to match the nonlinear vehicle dynamics to the dynamics of a linear system in a predefined structure; thus, a control-oriented model is obtained. The matching is achieved by an additional control input from a neural network, which is designed based on the input-output signals of the nonlinear vehicle system. In this paper, the process of closed-loop matching, i.e., the dataset generation, the training, and the evaluation of the neural network, is proposed. The evaluation process of the neural network through data-driven reachability analysis and statistical performance analysis methods is carried out. The proposed method is applied to achieve the path following functionality, in which the nonlinearities of the lateral vehicle dynamics are handled. The effectiveness of the closed-loop matching and the designed control functionality through high fidelity CarMaker simulations is illustrated.";Eotvos Lorand Res Network ELKH, Inst Comp Sci & Control SZTAKI, Kende U 13-17, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary;HUN-REN;2071-1050;2021;WOS:000777817400001;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5', 'Total Times Cited:  5', 'Cited Reference Count:  33'];OCT;13;10.3390/su132011264;11264;20;;;;;-1;Improving Sustainable Safe Transport via Automated Vehicle Control with Closed-Loop Matching;"10.3390/su132011264

333;333;JOUR;The Development of a CO2 Emission Coefficient for Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles with Different Road Slope Conditions Using Multiple Linear Regression, and Considering the Health Effects;SUSTAINABILITY;English;['CO(2)emissions', 'Asian highway network', 'health effects', 'road slope', 'MLR analysis', 'CARBON-DIOXIDE', 'GREEN'];The current studies on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and the impacts on public health focus mainly on evaluating CO(2)emissions from two types of emission sources. The first is a fixed source type from industrial plants, which can be controlled or easily evaluated. The second is a mobile source type from the transport sector, especially from medium- and heavy-duty vehicles (MHDVs), which produce high emissions. However, the common methods of evaluation of the average value of CO(2)emissions per kilometer of a vehicle use a general Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) model that does not consider the topography or road conditions. This affects the accuracy of CO(2)emission assessments and, in turn, affects the accuracy of any analysis needed to establish health policies and the management of public health within the affected area. In this paper, therefore, we present the development of emission coefficient calculations with varying topography conditions for MHDVs with consideration of the health effects on the populace. The study area was the Asian highway network in Thailand that passes through all regions and is geographically diverse. Data were collected from the Department of Highway's records, global positioning system (GPS) and electronic control unit (ECU) with data consisting of road data, slope, distance, traffic level and vehicle weight, as well as fuel consumption along the transportation route. To analyze and map out the correlation of the CO(2)emission coefficients for each road slope, we determined the coefficient of the CO(2)emissions using multiple linear regression analysis and validated this using Huber-White robust standard errors for heteroscedasticity. This method was more cost-efficient and time-efficient compared to the conventional approaches. We also created CO(2)emission maps with risk points for health effects, and we propose policy designs and plans to manage the traffic level in each of these areas prone to higher levels of such emissions.;Univ Thai Chamber Commerce, Grad Sch, 126-1 Vibhavadi Rangsit Rd, Bangkok 10400, Thailand;University Thai Chamber Commerce;2071-1050;2020;WOS:000569801700001;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6', 'Total Times Cited:  6', 'Cited Reference Count:  46'];SEP;12;10.3390/su12176994;6994;17;;;;;-1;The Development of a CO2 Emission Coefficient for Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles with Different Road Slope Conditions Using Multiple Linear Regression, and Considering the Health Effects;"10.3390/su12176994

Although AIS has been utilised in several different fields to address specific questions, no published work has outlined the potential of AIS as a tool for a wide range of industries and users of the marine environment such as spatial planning, developments, and local marine industries (e.g. fisheries). This work demonstrates a procedure for processing, analysing, and visualisation of AIS data with example outputs and their potential uses. Over 730 000 data points of AIS information for 2013 from around Shetland were processed, analysed, and mapped. Tools used included density mapping, vessel tracks, interpolations of vessel dimensions, and ship type analysis. The dataset was broken down by sector into meaningful and usable data packets which could also be analysed over time. Density mapping, derived from both point and vessel track data, proved highly informative but were unable to address all aspects of the data. Vessel tracks showed variation in vessel routes, especially around island groups. Additional uses of AIS data were addressed and included risk mapping for invasive non-native species, fisheries, and general statistics. Temporal variation of vessel activity was also discussed.

Decentralized dynamic game models are developed to obtain and compare the pricing and collecting decision of the CLSC with and without RPM. We find that: (i) RPM improves the actual collection rate and the profit of the recycler, while it decreases the prices of new and remanufactured products in market segments in response to higher consumer preferences; (ii) a higher buyback price guarantees that the manufacturer becomes more profitable when the government imposes low or high intensity of reward-penalty. Otherwise, the manufacturer should set a lower buyback price when the government imposes moderate intensity of reward-penalty; (iii) higher intensity of reward-penalty can not only effectively improve the environmental sustainability of CLSC, but also obtain higher social welfare; (iv) the mechanism that reward equals penalty is optimal, in which case the same intensity maximizes the actual collection rate as well as the profits of the manufacturer and the recycler.

421;421;CPAPER;Installation of road heavy duty (truck) engines on board of small inland self-propelled barges for an environmentally friendly European inland waterway transport of goods;TRANSPORT RESEARCH ARENA TRA2016;English;['Inland waterways', 'polluting emissions', 'boat engines', 'truck engines', 'Euro 6 standard', 'Freycinet'];Freight transport is an essential issue to the competitiveness of territories but the negative impact that it induces, like polluting emissions and their physical consequences on public health, have received growing attention in recent years. Policy makers set goals for sustainable development transportation. Since 1 January 2014, all new trucks have to be powered with a Euro 6 certified engine. Inland waterways are used for transportation of goods and are recognized for their contribution towards sustainable development therefore, engine's barges are old and emission of air pollutants are significant. Currently, the emission limits for inland waterway barges are defined in the Directive 97/86/CE on non-road mobile machinery. That emission limits are similar to Euro 2. The Euro 6 regulations reduced significantly the emission limits. The European Commission has recently proposed a revision of the Directive 97/86/CE which will significantly reduce emission limits. Development of new engines for the small market of small barges in France and also in Europe will be very expensive. Small barges owners should not be able to afford investments in new engines. The range of road engine power is similar to the small barges one. Using Euro 6 heavy duty engines will permit to reach low emissions of air pollutants and should be less expensive for small barges owners. A technical feasibility study had been carried out. It was based on an approach of all parameters of the re-power existing barges. Stakeholder's interviews permitted to deepen same specific topics. The technical feasibility study, added with expected environmental effect, has shown that no technical impossibility had been identified, but some key technical issues have to be considered. It has also confirmed re-powering existing barges (same propulsion power value, no change in naval transmission, etc.) with Euro 6 truck engines is interesting to limit significantly emission air pollutants. The on-board diagnostic controls monitor the engine's exhaust treatment and, it's important to adapt this monitoring for engines used in barges. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Super apps, which have already matured in Eastern markets, are now entering Western markets through the mobility sector, where they are poised to play a pivotal role in the mobility transition. We argue that the expected uptake of super apps will drive a transition towards a multi-service system, promoting the adoption of more sustainable transport modes while creating synergies with nontransport services. However, there remains a significant gap in research that explores the role of super apps within the broader context of mobility transitions. This perspective seeks to address this gap by describing how super apps could influence existing transport systems, while identifying future research areas such as regulatory frameworks, governance models, transition pathways and incumbent business model adaptation, and the socio-economic impacts of accelerating platformization.;German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Inst Transport Res, Berlin, Germany;Helmholtz Association;2210-4224;2025;WOS:001388250400001;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0', 'Total Times Cited:  0', 'Cited Reference Count:  61'];JUN;55;10.1016/j.eist.2024.100955;100955;;;;DEC 2024;;-1;Super apps and the mobility transition;"10.1016/j.eist.2024.100955

The inclusion of sustainability concept in industrial supply chains has started gaining momentum due to increased environmental protection awareness and social obligations. The selection of sustainable suppliers marks the first step toward accomplishing this objective. The problem of selecting the right suppliers fulfilling the sustainable requirements is a major MCDM problem since various conflicting factors are underplay in the selection process. The decision-makers are often confronted with inconsistent situations forcing them to make imprecise and vague decisions. Design/methodology/approachThis paper presents a new method based on dominance-based rough sets for the selection of right suppliers based on sustainable performance criteria relying on the triple bottom line approach. The method applied has its distinct advantages by providing more transparency in dealing with the preference information provided by the decision-makers and is thus found to be more intuitive and appealing as a performance measurement tool.

533;533;JOUR;System dynamics modeling for sustainable supply chain management: A literature review and systems thinking approach;JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION;English;['Sustainable supply chain management', 'System dynamics', 'Literature review', 'Conceptual framework', 'Stakeholder influences', 'Risk management', 'DISCRETE-EVENT SIMULATION', 'REVERSE LOGISTICS', 'LIFE-CYCLE', 'IMPACT ASSESSMENT', 'LOOP', 'GREEN', 'TRANSPORTATION', 'DESIGN', 'PERFORMANCE', 'FRAMEWORK'];Globalized economic systems involve complex supply chains (SCs) where environmental and social impacts are to be managed in alignment with diverse stakeholder expectations and to mitigate sustainability-related risks. Quantitative modeling approaches for sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) have gained increasing attention. Compared to analytical models and mathematical programming, simulation methods in SSCM are underrepresented, although system dynamics (SD) modeling is suitable to simulate and examine complex and dynamic systems and to support long-term, strategic decision-making. This paper provides a review of SSCM-related SD models, systematizes SSCM from a systems thinking perspective in a conceptual framework, and proposes guidelines for SD modeling in SSCM research. A content analysis of related literature examines SD models for forward, reverse, and closed-loop SCs that include environmental or social aspects of sustainability. It is found that a majority of models deals with macroscopic levels of analysis while models for intra- and inter-organizational SCs are less prominent. SSCM-related SD models integrate environmental and social sustainability metrics, governmental pressures and incentives or customer expectations, but uncertainties and risks are seldom modeled. Inferences for future SD modeling in SSCM are derived from this review to address strengths and shortcomings of extant SD modeling approaches for SSCM. SSCM-related constructs, model validation and the need of hybrid models, which integrate different simulation, optimization, or multi criteria decision-making models, are addressed. A framework for a systems thinking perspective on SSCM is conceptualized that may serve as a basis for future research. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We draw on Systems Theory to investigate the manner in which sourcing options of input materials affect the environmental performance of servicing firms in the BRICs. We hypothesize that servicing firms in developing countries can lower pollution intensity by (i) substituting dirty inputs with clean inputs and (ii) substituting domestically sourced inputs with inputs imported from developed countries. Based on the industry-level input-output matrix for the BRICs over the period 1995-2009, our empirical findings suggest that firms significantly improved their environmental performance by using cleaner inputs and more inputs imported from developed countries. We demonstrate service innovation in the form of green sourcing by using clean materials accessible through trade liberalisation to achieve environmental benefits.

However, little work has been done to simultaneously assess the impact of various vehicle types on populations of different socioeconomic/ethnic backgrounds. In this study, we employed an extreme gradient-boosting approach to spatially distribute light-duty vehicle (LDV) and heavy-duty truck emissions across the city of Toronto from 2006 to 2020. We examined associations between these emissions and different marginalization indices across this time span. Despite a large decrease in traffic emissions, disparities in exposure to traffic-related air pollution persisted over time. Populations with high residential instability, high ethnic concentration, and high material deprivation were found to reside in regions with significantly higher truck and LDV emissions. In fact, the gap in exposure to traffic emissions between the most residentially unstable populations and the least residentially unstable populations worsened over time, with trucks being the larger contributor to these disparities. Our data also indicate that the number of trucks and truck emissions increased substantially between 2019 and 2020 whilst LDVs decreased. Our results suggest that improvements in vehicle emission technologies are not sufficient to tackle disparities in exposure to traffic-related air pollution.;Univ Toronto, Dept Civil & Mineral Engn, Toronto, ON M5S 1A4, Canada;University of Toronto;0013-936X;2022;WOS:000890418200001;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9', 'Total Times Cited:  12', 'Cited Reference Count:  58'];DEC 6;56;10.1021/acs.est.2c04320;;23;16621;16632;NOV 2022;;-1;Fifteen Years of Community Exposure to Heavy-Duty Emissions: Capturing Disparities over Space and Time;"10.1021/acs.est.2c04320

In order to achieve this goal, drayage operators would need to transition 100% of their fleets to zero-emission vehicles such as battery electric trucks (BETs). This article presents an intelligently controlled charging model for BETs that minimizes charging costs while optimizing subsequent tour completion. To develop this model, real-world activity data from a drayage truck fleet operating in Southern California was combined with a two-stage clustering technique to identify trip and tour patterns. The energy consumption for each trip and tour was then simulated for BETs with a battery capacity of 565 kWh using a 150 kW charging power level. Home base charging load profiles were generated using the proposed charging model, subject to constraints of the energy needed to complete the next subsequent tour and Time-of-Use energy cost rates. A sensitivity analysis evaluated three scenarios: a passive scenario with a 5% state-of-charge (SOC) constraint after completing the subsequent tour, an average scenario with a 50% SOC constraint, and an aggressive scenario with an 80% SOC constraint. Results indicated that the 80% SOC constraint scenario achieved the lowest charging cost. However, it also yielded the lowest tour completion rate (51%). In contrast, the 5% SOC constraint scenario registered the highest tour completion rate. These results revealed that 96% of the tours could be successfully completed using the intelligently controlled charging model. The remaining tours were infeasible, indicating that the available time at the home base was inadequate for charging the necessary energy for the next tour. In terms of total costs, the scenario with a 5% SOC constraint resulted in an annual cost of approximately $40,000, whereas the 80% SOC scenario nearly doubled that amount.;Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Environm Res & Technol, Riverside, CA 92507 USA;University of California System;0018-9545;2024;WOS:001205788900069;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1', 'Total Times Cited:  1', 'Cited Reference Count:  37'];APR;73;10.1109/TVT.2023.3347730;;4;4530;4540;;;-1;An Intelligently Controlled Charging Model for Battery Electric Trucks in Drayage Operations;"10.1109/TVT.2023.3347730

This study analyzes the optimal operation decisions of a green supply chain for two manufacturers under different competitive and cooperative relationships, considering factors such as government subsidies, consumer green preferences, and the impact of the green information trust. The results show that government subsidies can lead to higher social welfare when manufacturers have a cooperative relationship, but the optimal choice of subsidies (for R&D costs or product production costs) depends on the level of competition and the difficulty of R&D. For the manufacturers, the optimal choice of R&D strategy (individual or joint) and the use of blockchain technology also depends on the level of difficulty of R&D and the type of government subsidies.

The Upgral Paradigm is an integrated model for the location-inventory-routing problem in a four-level supply chain where parameters such as demand, facility cost and inventory costs are taken into account uncertain as triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs). In this study, the characteristics and capabilities of passive defense in the supply chain, such as ""logistical flow rate"", ""backup path security"", ""the possibility of resource and equipment deployment"", and the dispersion principle were considered for location to increase the resilience of supply chain. The model was solved using Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and NSGA-II meta-heuristic algorithm. First, a four-objective mathematical model was proposed for the problem the objectives of which were: 1) minimizing supply chain costs; 2) maximizing social responsibility or social benefits; 3) minimizing environmental impacts; and 4) minimizing risk. Moreover, the experimental sample problems were solved in three small, medium, and large groups using the WOA Algorithm. The results of solving this algorithm were compared with the results of NSGA-II one according to the indices including quality, dispersion, uniformity and solution time indices to prove the efficiency of the algorithm. Based on the results, the WOA algorithm had a higher ability to achieve higher quality and near-optimal solutions than NSGA-II algorithm in all cases. The dispersion index values indicated that the WOA Algorithm performed better in exploring and extracting the feasible region.

620;620;JOUR;Bottlenecks in Nigeria's fresh food supply chain: What is the way forward?;TRENDS IN FOOD SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY;English;"['Keywords', 'Sustainable supply chain', 'Reducing hunger', ""Farmer 's income"", 'Food security', 'Smallholder farmers', 'CHALLENGES']";Background: Nigeria is one of the leading producers of fresh produce, most of which is grown by smallholder farmers. Over 40% of this fresh produce is lost after harvest, resulting in more than 30% loss in smallholders' income.Scope and approach: We identify the major bottlenecks in Nigeria's fresh food supply chain responsible for the high food losses. We propose possible solutions to mitigate them.Key findings and conclusions: A key bottleneck is that most fresh food produced in the northern region is largely consumed in the south, with the produce traveling long distances through a poor road network. The lack of a continuous cold chain is another key causative factor for food loss. Less than 10% of the fresh food produced passes through a cold chain despite the long distances it needs to travel. There is also limited access to supply chain data and expert market intelligence to assist stakeholders in the decision-making process and process optimizations. To mitigate food losses, smallholder farmers and retailers need better access to clean cooling solutions at affordable prices. This will help them extend produce shelf life and sell produce at attractive market prices by being able to cool their produce. Simple and small-scale passive cooling solutions may also help pre-serve food for these stakeholders, but are currently rarely used. Furthermore, the available open data needs to be made easily accessible to stakeholders along the fresh supply chain so they can make informed decisions on how best to reduce food losses and maximize profit. Smallholder farmers would also significantly benefit from easier access to expert intelligence on postharvest storage and market information. Providing such expertise via mobile apps can be a powerful tool for remote farmers in a country like Nigeria. Otherwise, it could be difficult to reach them.

658;658;JOUR;Effect of Optimal Subsidy Rate and Strategic Behaviour of Supply Chain Members under Competition on Green Product Retailing;MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING;English;['GAME-THEORETIC APPROACH', 'SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY', 'PRICE-COMPETITION', 'GOVERNMENT', 'DECISIONS', 'POLICIES', 'INTERVENTION', 'DEMAND', 'MODEL'];This paper investigates the impact of the subsidy and horizontal strategic cooperation on a green supply chain where two competing manufacturers distribute substitutable green products through exclusive retailers. Models are formulated in three-stage game structures in five different scenarios, where the government organization determines optimal subsidy by pursuing social welfare maximization. Both manufacturers invest in improving green quality levels of products. The study aims to explore the advantage of vertical integration and strategic collusion from the perspective of green supply chain practice in the presence of subsidy. The key contributions from the present study indicate that under competition, members of both supply chains are able to receive higher profits through horizontal collusion, but green quality levels of the product remain suboptimal. If upstream manufacturers cooperate, government subsidy does not necessarily improve product quality level, and the amount of government expenditure increased substantially. By comparing outcomes where members are vertically integrated with scenarios where members make strategic collusion, we found that the former might outperform by later. Cross-price sensitivity appears as a significant parameter affecting supply chain members' performance and the amount of government expenditure. Cooperation between members at the horizontal level is a more robust strategic measure than vertical integration if consumers are highly price-sensitive.;Aalborg Univ, Dept Mat & Prod, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark;Aalborg University;1024-123X;2021;WOS:000629522300001;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  15', 'Total Times Cited:  15', 'Cited Reference Count:  69'];MAR 1;2021;10.1155/2021/6661103;6661103;;;;;;-1;Effect of Optimal Subsidy Rate and Strategic Behaviour of Supply Chain Members under Competition on Green Product Retailing;"10.1155/2021/6661103

We reviewed the literature and the official website that showed SAN and urban planning policies of Belo Horizonte-MG; we also built maps. In this city, SAN programs serve more than 1 million people a day, including initiatives to encourage food production, protection and promotion of food consumption, subsidized marketing of foods and meals, and food training. We found a concentration of shops selling FV - including those with public subsidies (open air markets and public farmers' markets) - in the richest region of the city, limiting the access of those living in the outskirts of the city. We also found territories with health promotion services (Health Academy Program). However, the increase in public and private farmers' markets, open air markets and supermarkets would be able to promote the access to healthy foods in the disadvantaged territories. These data show that civil society and government representatives must watch public policies, aiming to reduce inequities, and contribute to improve the quality of life and social well-being of the population, in addition to collaborate for sustainable food systems. We suggest that SAN public policies should dialogue with other policies, such as those ofurban planning, social welfare, and agriculture, to promote fairness and intersectorally meet the needs of more vulnerable communities.";Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Nutr, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil;Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais;0104-1290;2017;WOS:000413756700014;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  31', 'Total Times Cited:  37', 'Cited Reference Count:  25'];JUL-SEP;26;10.1590/S0104-12902017168867;;3;764;773;;;-1;"Food environment and access to fruits and vegetables: ""A metropolis into perspective""";"10.1590/S0104-12902017168867

Such firms may set up new plants in other developed countries while maintaining their domestic plants. In contrast, we here consider firms that close down their domestic operations and relocate to countries where wage costs are lower. Thus, we assume that firms may reduce their production costs by investing in R&D and likewise by moving their plants abroad. We show that these two mechanisms are complementary. When a firm relocates it invests more in R&D than when it does not change its location and, therefore, its production cost is lower in the first case. As a result, investment in R&D encourages firms to relocate.;Univ Basque Country, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 1, UPV EHU, Bilbao 48015, Spain;University of Basque Country;1617-982X;2014;WOS:000334515200002;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7', 'Total Times Cited:  7', 'Cited Reference Count:  22'];APR;13;10.1007/s10258-014-0096-4;;1;25;38;;;-1;Relocation and investment in R&D by firms;"10.1007/s10258-014-0096-4

In this paper, we analyze the VRPB literature with a sustainability perspective, which covers environmental and social objectives, collaborative networks and reverse logistics. First, to better understand and analyze the VRPB literature, all related works are characterized according to a common taxonomy provided for routing problems. This taxonomy is extended to differentiate between economic, environmental and social objectives. After identification of all VRPB papers that include sustainability issues, these are analyzed and discussed in more detail. The analysis reveals that research on VRPBs with sustainability concerns is recent and relatively scarce and the most popular aspects investigated are the minimization of fuel consumption andCO2 emissions. Future research lines driven by sustainability concerns are suggested for the VRPB as a promoter of green logistics.;Univ Porto, INESC TEC, FEUP Fac Engn, R Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal;Universidade do Porto;1134-5764;2020;WOS:000541854300006;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  16', 'Total Times Cited:  20', 'Cited Reference Count:  157'];JUL;28;10.1007/s11750-019-00534-0;;2;358;401;;;-1;The vehicle routing problem with backhauls towards a sustainability perspective: a review;"10.1007/s11750-019-00534-0

In order to facilitate governments to make emission reduction subsidy and recycling subsidy decisions and LC-CLSC members to formulate pricing, emission reduction investment and recycling investment decisions, this paper proposes multiple three-level differential game models of a LC-CLSC involving the manufacturer, retailer and government considering the dynamic characteristics of product goodwill and recycling rate. Under the four scenarios of three different power structures: manufacturer-led, retailer-led and non-led, and centralized decision-making, some critical equilibrium results are first solved and discussed, including government's optimal emission reduction subsidy and recycling subsidy rates, the manufacturer's wholesale price and emission reduction investment, the retailer's retail price and recycling investment, product goodwill and waste product recycling rate, profits of the manufacturer, retailer and government, etc. To further achieve the LC-CLSC coordination, the contracts under three different power structures are designed, and the conditions that the coordination parameters satisfy are given. Through mathematical derivation of equilibrium results and sensitivity analysis with the help of numerical examples, this paper finds that the government subsidy rates are dependent on the power status between manufacturers and retailers, and the weaker party will get higher subsidy rate. The government subsidy mechanism can significantly reduce the gaps between the manufacturer-led and retailer-led cases, such as manufacturer's emission reduction investment, the retailer's recycling investment, steady-state retail price, and product goodwill and recycling rate. Under the effect of the government subsidy mechanism, the non-led case is more conducive to the recycling of waste products and the improvement of social welfare than the unilateral domination cases. The findings can help manufacturers and retailers in the LC-CLSC formulate optimal strategies like pricing, emission reduction and recycling, and develop coordination contracts to further improve the overall performance of the supply chain according to their different power structures. More importantly, they can also help governments make optimal emission reduction and recycling subsidy decisions according to member companies' different power structures so as to improve subsidy efficiency.

This paper describes a novel New Rail System, ""NRS"" that achieves the stated objectives. The NRS utilizes existing rail rights-of-way and tracks. It has the capability to accommodate both freight and passenger movement. In its initial implementation it supports speeds of 85 mph. Although no invention is required, three modifications to the railroad infrastructure are required, (1) elimination of at-grade crossings, (2) electrification, and (3) transition from dieselelectric locomotive powered trains to individual electrical powered pallets to allow flexible routing and sorting in the network. The four elements defining NRS are; (1) self-powered 70-foot pallets, (2) freight and passenger payload modules (loadable and unloadable from the pallets), (3) pallet yards, accumulators and transfer stations, and (4) a pallet control system. An initial cost-benefits analysis shows that if BNSF implemented the NRS on its Southern Transcon route between Los Angeles and Chicago a payback of the initial $21.2 billion investment can be achieved in under four-years.";Greybeards Res Grp, 7528 S Tanglewild Dr, Raleigh, NC 27613 USA;;978-0-7918-5755-7;2016;WOS:000377420000018;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0', 'Total Times Cited:  0', 'Cited Reference Count:  13'];;;;V012T15A018;;;;;"['[', ""'"", '[', ""'"", ',', '', '""', ""'"", '""', ',', '', ""'"", 'A', ""'"", ',', '', ""'"", 'S', ""'"", ',', '', ""'"", 'M', ""'"", ',', '', ""'"", 'E', ""'"", ',', '', '""', ""'"", '""', ',', '', ""'"", ']', ""'"", ']']";-1;THE NEW RAIL SYSTEM;;"Rail Transportation; Rail System Concepts; Freight-Passenger Rail; Rail System Research"

As a starting point, for rail megaprojects, their scope may, at times, alter due to some risks and uncertainties. As many such projects exceed many years in development, their scope and formation will not be a linear trajectory. It is, therefore, the aim of this paper to evaluate the difficulties in determining the scope of rail megaprojects. This paper first introduces the theoretical framework via adaptive decision-making and policy setting when dealing with mega rail projects. Through sustainable development, carefully applied research is undertaken to highlight some of the key shortfalls of current practices when dealing with mega rail projects. This includes categorizing sustainability into four dimensions: social, economic, environmental, and engineering for rail infrastructure. To address the existing gap in the literature, including the appropriate alignment of policy planning and design, this paper will carefully review the complex science of rail megaprojects. This can be seen as a conceptual framework, which combines complex theory and practice to develop a theoretical perspective to initiate, plan, execute, and commission mega rail projects. Particularly with an international focus, this paper will review global development, targeting rail infrastructures. For rail megaprojects, strategically integrated objectives are traditionally key functions within the regional land transport network along with the national network and are necessary to (i) improve connectivity, both nationally and inter-regionally for people, communities, regions, and industry via effectively linking the existing broad-based transport network; (ii) enhance logistical systems and trade; (iii) provide a consistent framework for continuous sustainable development; and (iv) provide a consistent framework for long-term economic and social benefits.";RMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, Melbourne 3000, Australia;Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT);2673-4109;2023;WOS:001199304600001;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2', 'Total Times Cited:  2', 'Cited Reference Count:  58'];JUN;4;10.3390/civileng4020031;;2;538;550;;;-1;Challenges in Determining the Scope of Rail Megaprojects: Responding to Ever-Increasing Infrastructure Demand;"10.3390/civileng4020031

This study also evaluates the impact of SC resilience strategies' implementation on the triple bottom line of SC sustainability. Design/methodology/approachA hybrid three-phased method is proposed to meet the research objectives of this study. In the first phase, this study uses the Delphi technique to select SC resilience strategies and SC sustainability dimensions. In the second phase, the best-worst method is used to assess the relative weights of resilience strategies. Finally, in the third stage, summative Likert scoring is used to understand the impact of SC resilience strategies on the SC sustainability triple bottom line. FindingsThe outcomes reveal that firms give due importance to inter-organizational relationships and supplier nearness for supply continuity. In the sustainability context, the obtained scores proved that resilience strategies have the maximum impact on economic sustainability, followed by environmental sustainability. Research limitations/implicationsTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that examines aspects of SC resilience strategies and quantifies their impact on the triple bottom line of SC sustainability. This study is specific to the automobile sector; sectoral diversity may expose similarities and dissimilarities in the approach. Practical implicationsThe outcome establishes that supplier-manufacturer relationships need to be strengthened further to tackle any future uncertainties. Besides, supplier location decisions may also be revisited. The strategies proposed will aid SC managers to make informed decisions to prepare for uncertain events. Originality/valueIn the face of uncertain events, often SCs trade-off sustainability in pursuit of resilience. It manifests that resilience is a prerequisite for SC sustainability. While planning SCs, organizations often choose either sustainability or resilience.

The state of Oregon has adopted climate policies to reduce transportation fuel carbon intensity (CI). These climate policies have the potential co-benefit of reducing air pollution exposure disparities for different socio-economic groups. Here we analyze the emissions and air quality outcomes of three future year (2035) scenarios for transportation fuels in Oregon: (i) a Business as usual (BAU) scenario, (ii) a Clean Fuels Program (CFP) scenario that represents adoption and successful achievement of a proposed 25% reduction in carbon intensity in 2035; and (iii) a maximum ambition scenario (CFP MAX) that builds on the CFP scenario to achieve a 37% CI reduction by adopting low carbon fuels more aggressively, especially for heavy duty vehicles. Transportation emissions under all scenarios were estimated using the MOVES model for every county in Oregon. Detailed emissions with 4 km spatial resolution were then developed for each scenario by scaling the National Emissions Inventory (NEI) for the year 2017 based on the emissions derived from the MOVES analysis. Air quality in 2035 was simulated using the UCD/CIT chemical transport model that enables a detailed analysis of PM2.5 and PM0.1 components and sources. Exposure fields were analyzed using the BenMAP model to predict public health outcomes. Environmental justice analysis was conducted by race/ethnicity categories and income categories obtained from the American Community Survey (ACS). Results suggest that adoption of low-carbon transportation fuels will improve air quality in Oregon, yielding public health benefits equivalent to approximately $80M/yr. Adoption of low carbon transportation fuels will also reduce disparities in exposure to transportation-related air pollution between residents in different race/ethnicity categories by -14% in Portland and -20% in Salem. Adoption of low-carbon fuels reduces PM2.5 mass disparity by 10% in Salem, but does not have a significant effect in Portland, because on-road mobile sources contribute to less than 3% of the total PM2.5 mass disparity in this city. The analysis reveals that the spatial distribution of each race/ethnicity group in each city is the primary factor that determines the impact of low carbon fuel adoption on exposure disparity.";Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, Davis, CA USA;University of California System;1352-2310;2023;WOS:000925129900001;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4', 'Total Times Cited:  5', 'Cited Reference Count:  62'];MAR 1;296;10.1016/j.atmosenv.2023.119582;119582;;;;JAN 2023;;-1;Modeling expected air quality impacts of Oregon?s proposed expanded clean fuels program;"10.1016/j.atmosenv.2023.119582

Short product life cycle, intricate supply chain, unpredictable demand, tight profit margins are major challenges for FMEG industries. Scarcity of rawmaterial, unpredictable delay in transportation from foreign suppliers, non-availability of affordable skilled labor, changing customer demand have completely transformed the electric goods industries. Increasing demand for good-quality low-cost products is giving abundant opportunities of growth to FMEG industries if they manage issues and challenges of supply chain management (SCM). In this research paper, authors have studied the issues and challenges of FMEG supply chain using situation actor process-learning action performance (SAP-LAP) methodology. Authors have observed that Indian FMEG are facing challenges like supply chain collaboration (outsourcing of non-core operations, vertically integrating core competencies), retail integration, supply risk management (natural, terrorism, demand and supply), supply chain planning (demand-driven supply chains), reverse logistic, sustainability, and green supply chain and digital supply chain.;Amity Univ, Dept Mech & Automat, Noida 201303, India;Amity University Noida;2195-4356;2019;WOS:000493511600029;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2', 'Total Times Cited:  2', 'Cited Reference Count:  7'];;;10.1007/978-981-13-6412-9_29;;;309;313;;;-1;Challenges for Effective and Efficient Supply Chain Management for Fast Moving Electrical Goods (FMEG): A Case Study;"10.1007/978-981-13-6412-9_29

Based on a survey of planners in 32 communities, this article examines initiatives to encourage grocery retail investment, reasons for the existence or absence of initiatives, and factors in successful developments. This research shows that systematic, citywide grocery initiatives are rare, with such efforts limited to particular sites or developments. Reliance on private initiatives, absence of grassroots requests for action, and assignment of lower priority to grocery stores in commercial revitalization programs explain planner inaction. Successful initiatives are characterized by political leadership, competent public agency participation, and, often, partnerships with nonprofit agencies. This article also presents recommendations for community and economic development planners to increase grocery investment in underserved areas.;Wayne State Univ, Detroit, MI 48202 USA;Wayne State University;0891-2424;2005;WOS:000230444700003;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  94', 'Total Times Cited:  130', 'Cited Reference Count:  30'];AUG;19;10.1177/0891242404273517;;3;232;244;;;-1;Attracting supermarkets to inner-city neighborhoods: Economic development outside the box;"10.1177/0891242404273517

This paper interrogates promotional visualizations about CAVs as they imagine future automated mobilities and the scaling up of the technologies from small trials to mass roll-out. It analyses a wide range of images from a CAV trial in a UK city and demonstrates that these images reinforce rather than disrupt traditional gendered associations of automobility. This study further develops this work and notes other ways in which visualizations of CAV-enabled network mobility reiterate existing network capital inequalities. It also pays careful attention to the background urban environment in which CAVS are pictured. The paper argues that an absence of people and place specificity enable CAV technologies to be imagined as being used in other locations and contexts. Hence the visualizations of CAV that picture only specific forms corporeal mobility also work to envision the mobility of entrepreneurial capital, as the software and hardware behind the driverless vehicle is shown as transferable to, and profitable in, different contexts and situations.;Open Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Dept Geog, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England;Open University - UK;0435-3684;2020;WOS:000528363800001;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  20', 'Total Times Cited:  20', 'Cited Reference Count:  67'];APR 2;102;10.1080/04353684.2020.1747943;;2;155;171;APR 2020;;-1;Who's behind the wheel?

Drawing on technology, organisation and environment (TOE) perspective, the objective of this study is to empirically investigate the hierarchical effects of smart logistics on smart city sustainable dimensions (i.e. environmental, social and economic). Design/methodology/approach The study used cross-sectional survey to collect data from urban transporters, warehouse managers, retailers and information technology (IT) managers in Australia. Data were analysed using structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the hypothesised relationship between constructs of smart logistics and smart city sustainable performance. Findings The findings reveal that information and communications technologies (ICTs) use and IT capability (ITC) have positive and significant effects on smart logistics. Technology-enabled smart logistics have an immediate positive effect on smart city environment, which in turn has positive impacts on social and economic performance. Practical implications The study informs managers that smart logistics equipped with freight transport telematics can improve smart city environment through enhanced tracking and tracing of goods movement. The improved environmental stewardship is likely to support social and economic performance. Originality/value Smart city research remains primarily theoretical and focussed on concerns surrounding sustainable growth amid urbanisation and digitalisation.

We found that when manufacturer does not (does) implement online recycling channel intrusion, government subsidies have (have not) a transmission effect. However, when the government subsidizes manufacturer (recycling platform), channel intrusion will increase (decrease) the digital technology empowerment level of recycling platform. Meanwhile, excessive subsidies for recycling platform are not conducive to remanufacturing.

The system consists of one supplier, one leader retailer 1, one follower retailer 2, and the government. In this system, the government subsidizes each retailer based on the selling price of the product. The supplier is subject to a yield uncertainty process. The suppler decides whether to leak leader retailer 1 ' s order quantity to follower retailer 2 or not. In this study, we first built a Stackelberg game to address the equilibrium green operation decisions, when the supplier has and has not information leakage behavior, respectively. Subsequently, we identify the supplier's information leakage equilibrium and how such behavior affects retailers' ex ante profits, consumer surplus, and social welfare through a numerical study. Interestingly, we obtained the following results: (1) Supplier leaks are the unique equilibrium of the supplier. The product's green degree and wholesale price at supplier's equilibrium are higher under information leakage than under no information leakage. (2) The supplier's information leakage behavior is good for leader retailer 1 and bad for follower retailer 2. (3) Information leakage behavior increases both consumer surplus and social welfare under certain conditions. (4) In general, key system parameters (e.g., the subsidy rate, supply uncertainty, supply correlation, and forecast accuracies) positively correlate with consumer surplus and social welfare in the same direction, while they affect retailer 1 ' s and retailer 2 ' s ex ante profit in the opposite direction.

This issue profoundly affects collectors' capacity to recover materials. In a two-period CLSC with remanufacturing, including a manufacturer and a retailer, we develop game-theoretical models in the centralized and decentralized scenarios and compare the optimal solutions, consumer surplus, social welfare and environmental impact of different models through analytical and numerical analysis. Our aim is to examine firms' dynamic pricing strategies and collection investment decisions by considering customers' perception of channel inconvenience. There are four main findings. Firstly, in the centralized model and the retailer collection model, the decision-maker lowers the retail price in the first period. However, in the competitive collection model, the manufacturer and the retailer raise the wholesale and retail prices in the first period, respectively. Secondly, in the retailer collection model, as the recycling revenue increases, the manufacturer, although not involved in collecting, the profit also increases due to the free-rider behavior. Thirdly, in the competitive collection model, when the remanufacturing cost savings is relatively high, the collection investment of the manufacturer is much larger than that of the retailer, resulting in the retailer failing to collect any product and giving up collecting. Finally, the collection competition improves the total collection rate and environmental performance but reduces the profit of the manufacturer and the retailer, as well as the consumer surplus and social welfare. Therefore, we design a two-part tariff contract to coordinate the decentralized model and effectively improve the performance of the supply chain.;Xiamen Univ, Sch Management, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China;Xiamen University;1366-5545;2025;WOS:001372615000001;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0', 'Total Times Cited:  0', 'Cited Reference Count:  47'];FEB;194;10.1016/j.tre.2024.103869;103869;;;;DEC 2024;;-1;Optimal pricing and collection decisions in a two-period closed-loop supply chain considering channel inconvenience;"10.1016/j.tre.2024.103869

Adopting green supply chain management in the construction process is an important way to realize the goal of sustainable development of mega projects. Because the green supply chain behavior during construction is mainly demonstrated by contractors, it is especially important to study the evolutionary trend of their behavior. Thus, to explore the cooperative relationship among contractors, this paper considers a lengthy construction period, multi-agent participation dynamics, and opportunistic behaviorall are key features of mega projectsand establishes an evolutionary game model. Specifically, a replicator dynamic equation is used to describe the long-term effects of the contractor's decisions. Equilibrium determinants are then analyzed and simulated. The results show that the initial probabilities of the two types of contractors (main contractor and subcontractor) demonstrating opportunistic behaviors have a significant effect on the direction of evolution of the mega project. The main contractor, who dominates the subsidy allocation by the government and project owner, should pay attention to maintaining a balance in the income distribution between him or her and the subcontractor. Additionally, there is an optimal distribution coefficient for the subsidy that minimizes the overall probability of opportunistic behavior.

The implementation of these policies has changed the operating environment of traditional closed-loop supply chains, while the privacy of relevant information increases the difficulty of decision-making. Under the background, this paper considers the green closed-loop supply chain (GCLSC) under the hybrid policy of recycling subsidy and carbon tax where the manufacturer is in charge of recycling and the retailer invests in green marketing. Taking green marketing cost coefficient as the retailer's private information, this paper explores the influence of information asymmetry on optimal decisions and performance of the GCLSC. By constructing game models of information symmetry and asymmetry, the optimal decisions, economic and environmental performance, and social welfare are provided. Combined with numerical analysis, the influence of uncertainty of the manufacturer's estimation, subsidies and carbon tax on the GCLSC is proposed. The results indicate that the uncertainty in the manufacturer's estimation can improve the social welfare under certain conditions, but it cannot reduce carbon emissions. Recycling subsidy and carbon tax policies oppositely affect the manufacturer's optimal decisions and carbon emissions. Information asymmetry is beneficial to the retailer. However, less uncertainty in estimation is not always better for the manufacturer. The manufacturer needs to proactively adopt strategies to stimulate the retailer's information sharing.;Qufu Normal Univ, Sch Management, Rizhao 276826, Peoples R China;Qufu Normal University;2071-1050;2022;WOS:000824225900001;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9', 'Total Times Cited:  9', 'Cited Reference Count:  48'];JUL;14;10.3390/su14137999;7999;13;;;;;-1;Impact of Information Asymmetry on the Operation of Green Closed-Loop Supply Chain under Government Regulation;"10.3390/su14137999

Furthermore, it tests whether the organizational context strengthens these relationships. Design/methodology/approach The authors used regression models to analyze data collected through an international survey carried out within the scope of a European project involving six Central European regions. Findings Results show that small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) having stronger internal and external SC have a higher propensity to adopt I4.0 technologies, and both management support and absorptive capacity (AC) strengthen these relationships, whereas investments in AMTs within the manufacturing area and internal SC have a positive association with the intensity of I4.0 adoption. However, in presence of a high level of management support and AC, the relationship between external SC and I4.0 adoption becomes positive and significant. Management support also moderates the impact that investments in AMTs in the manufacturing area and internal SC have on the intensity of adoption of I4.0 technologies.

In particular, although the new EU WEEE collection target has not been reached by many EU countries, several studies show that an optimized WEEE wastes management processes could represent a relevant way to achieve economic, environmental and social benefits expected by the adoption of circular economy approaches. According to this, the paper aims to evaluate the extent to which the current Italian organization of the WEEE management system and the related legislation are able to support the achievement of the targets defined by EU with a specific focus on the collection centers (CCs) which play a key role being the initial point of the WEEE reverse logistic cycle. An illustrative analysis based on the transition probability matrix regarding both the e-waste collecting performance and the distribution of collecting centers in the Italian provinces is illustrated. Furthermore, we have analyzed the presence of a correlation between the WEEE collection rate and the presence of the CCs in different provinces in order to better comprehend the role that can play both the investments in CC system and other soft measures in achieving the WEEE collection targets. Results show that the current Italian organization of the WEEE management system and the related legislations are not so effective in supporting the achievement of EU WEEE collection targets at the national level, although some geographical areas and provinces outperform the EU targets.;Engn Ingn Informat SPA, Energy & Util Div, Ctr Direz Milanofiori, Palazzo D3, I-20090 Assago, MI, Italy;Telecom Italia;2071-1050;2019;WOS:000467752200243;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  65', 'Total Times Cited:  66', 'Cited Reference Count:  53'];APR 2;11;10.3390/su11082430;2430;8;;;;;-1;The Reverse Supply Chain of the E-Waste Management Processes in a Circular Economy Framework: Evidence from Italy;"10.3390/su11082430

977;977;JOUR;Enhancing Fastener Standardization for Disassembly: A Path to Sustainable Laptop Design;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED ENGINEERING;English;['Design for disassembly', 'disassembly time', 'laptop design', 'standardized fasteners', 'sustainability', 'sustainability'];This project aims to design a laptop for easy of disassembly, thereby reducing disassembly time. The challenges associated with product disassembly include the complexity of replacing worn-out components, managing various types of fasteners, and finding solutions for end-of- life products. This paper focuses on the design for disassembly of laptops by standardizing fasteners to minimize disassembly time. A modified design is proposed to decrease the disassembly time of the laptop compared to the reference design. The laptop components and fasteners are designed using Autodesk Inventor, and the disassembly time is calculated accordingly. The comparison between the new design and the reference design reveals significant improvements in disassembly time for both the laptop screen and keyboard. Specifically, the disassembly time is reduced by a factor of 4 for the laptop screen and 4.5 for the keyboard. Furthermore, the number of required disassembly tools is reduced from three different screwdrivers to just one. The primary objective of the new laptop design is to ensure easy disassembly and reassembly. By making product components easily accessible for repair, replacement, recycling, and reuse, this design not only saves time and resources for manufacturing and recycling companies but also reduces labor costs. It enhances customer satisfaction and minimizes the time and effort required for quick disassembly during product repair and refurbishment. In conclusion, Design for Disassembly is an effective approach for creating sustainable products that can be easily disassembled, facilitating simpler maintenance, repair, recovery, and reuse of components and materials.;SEGi Univ, Fac Engn Built Environm & Informat Technol, Petaling Jaya 47810, Selangor, Malaysia;SEGi University;2229-838X;2024;WOS:001397801100001;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0', 'Total Times Cited:  0', 'Cited Reference Count:  17'];;16;10.30880/ijie.2024.16.09.016;;9;209;217;;;-1;Enhancing Fastener Standardization for Disassembly: A Path to Sustainable Laptop Design;"10.30880/ijie.2024.16.09.016

In particular, the work seeks to uncover the initiatives developed directly or indirectly by manufacturing firms and the factors that enhance them. A systematic literature review is used to examine the breadth of the sustainable supply chain literature. The papers obtained are screened and analysed using established procedures to produce bibliometric and thematic analyses. The findings show the evolution of this young field around key research groups with few papers looking beyond focal firms to immediate suppliers and even fewer examining multiple tiers. Whilst numerous organisational factors are identified, few works consider most of them together and none capture their interrelationships at such breadth. Within this field lacking in theory, the originality of the work is the assembly of environmental and social practices into an integrated framework for their diffusion across supply chain tiers in the design and implementation of supplier development initiatives. There is recognition of where in the supply chain these practices are applied. The implications of this research are a framework around which supply chain diffusion theory can be tested and subsequent potential for its deployment in business to guide sustainable practice adoption.;Fed Inst Educ Sci & Technol Rio Grande do Norte, Res Nucleus Sustainable Enterprise NESE, Campus Natal Cent IFRN CNAT, Natal, RN, Brazil;Instituto Federal do Rio Grande do Norte;1535-3958;2021;WOS:000678095000001;['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  14', 'Total Times Cited:  15', 'Cited Reference Count:  124'];NOV;28;10.1002/csr.2165;;6;1870;1890;JUL 2021;;-1;Supply chain environmental and social sustainability practice diffusion: Bibliometrics, content analysis and conceptual framework;"10.1002/csr.2165
