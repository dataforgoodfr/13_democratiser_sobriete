AB  - New trends in the economy involve not only stable profit maximization and sustainable cost minimization, but also taking into account such factors as the natural, social and spiritual environment, which has become a fundamental basis that must withstand serious degradation. Global climate change, gender and social inequality lead to a revision of the world view and awareness of the importance of sustainable development, which is necessary to solve systemic crises and global challenges. The state of the environment is the basis of food security, which depends on the efficiency of agricultural production and the improvement of agro– and biotechnologies, these issues are based on the policy of sustainable development and are translated into the development strategies of regions and countries. Population growth, an increase in anthropogenic impact, and environmental degradation require each individual organization to choose a concept for achieving sustainable development goals, which should be reflected in the development strategy of the region. These new rules, uncharacteristic for the business turnover of many organizations, contain a sufficient number of debatable issues, primarily due to the lack of regulatory regulation of these issues. This article is intended to systematize the variety of sources of information on this issue and determine the requirements dictated by modern trends in the field of the ESG agenda for existing regional development strategies. An important part of the region's strategy is the creation of a carbon polygon, an experimental site for monitoring the circulation of carbon in nature, its presence in forests, cities, ecosystems, in order to be able to assess how much carbon is absorbed by domestic ecosystems, to be able to influence the trans-carbon tax and direct its funds to protection environment. The creation of carbon landfills should help determine how much of which tree species should be planted to offset harmful greenhouse gas emissions, which must necessarily be accompanied by monitoring of greenhouse gas fluxes in ecosystems. © E.A.

AB  - In 2020, the Chinese government set the objective of achieving carbon neutrality, making it essential to understand the urbanization process in order to effectively implement future sustainable development strategies. Here, we demonstrate the urbanization development of 31 provincial capitals in mainland China from 1985 to 2020, including changes in impervious surfaces, socio-economic development, carbon emissions, and population. Using elasticity coefficients and the carbon emissions causal equation for quantitative analysis, we explore the relationships among these factors. We found that the national urban expansion rate experienced rapid growth, followed by a slowdown, with the peak occurring between 2000 and 2005. In just 40 years, total urban area expanded from 11,280 km2 to 40,429 km2, with eastern cities growing faster than those in the west. Despite similar trends, different cities displayed four distinct spatial characteristics, shaped by factors such as topography, transportation, and policies. Moreover, urban economic development is gradually decoupling from carbon emissions, accompanied by a declining reliance on urban area expansion and a reduced growth rate of carbon emissions. A strong decoupling trend between economic growth and carbon emissions has already emerged in the South & Central and Northwest regions, offering a preliminary explanation for the observed slowdown in carbon emissions. The study provides a comprehensive overview of the urbanization process in mainland China, highlighting low-carbon urban transformations and revealing how government policies have significantly shaped the development patterns of Chinese cities. These findings offer valuable insights for policymakers to further promote sustainable development goals.

AB  - The multifunctionality of green infrastructure (GI) has become an important component of sustainable urban development, influenced by the pressures associated with climate extremes and agglomeration of populations. The protection and construction of urban GI is an essential way of adapting to the national policy of high-quality development at the current stage. However, how GI is developed needs to be further discussed. In this study, Zhengzhou City, a centre city in China, as a case. We proposed an analytical framework of "functional assessment - correlation analysis - corridor network" in this study. It specifically refers to the assessment and the trade-off and synergy analysis of the six GI functions, namely stormwater management, climate regulation, landscape recreation, air quality, biodiversity and social vulnerability. This is based on the bivariate local indicators of spatial association and circuit theory methods. We found that the urban GI construction areas do not match the built-up areas of the city. Moreover, most of the GI functions were found to show synergistic effects, except for the trade-off with air quality. In addition, we constructed a GI network containing 12 GI hubs and 24 GI corridors to address the inequality in geospatial distribution of GI due to spatial heterogeneity. This paper provides a reliable strategic foundation for the relevant decision makers to optimize GI planning in Zhengzhou. It also provides a scientific reference for GI planning in similar areas to support sustainable habitat development in metropolitan areas.

AB  - Introduction: Food waste is a significant global challenge, with critical implications for food security, ecosystem services, biodiversity, and human health. Despite growing attention to food waste in food service sectors, workplace buffet-style canteens—particularly in China—remain understudied. This research addresses this gap by quantifying food waste and evaluating its environmental impacts in workplace buffet-style canteens in Beijing, China. Methods: Field surveys were conducted in four workplace buffet-style canteens in Beijing during August and September 2021. Systematic sampling yielded 656 valid samples. Food waste was measured using a direct weighing method, categorized into eight food types, and analyzed for its environmental impacts using carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, water, and ecological footprint metrics. Conversion factors were applied to translate cooked food into raw agricultural equivalents for consistent impact assessment. Results: The study found an average daily per capita food waste of 158.4 g, with lunch contributing the highest waste (78.8 g) compared to breakfast and dinner. While vegetables were the largest contributors by weight, livestock products, though comprising only 29.9% of waste, accounted for the majority of environmental impacts, including 96.7% of the ecological footprint and 85.7% of the water footprint. Self-run canteens generated less waste across all meals compared to outsourced ones, and higher food and cuisine diversity were associated with increased food waste. Discussion: The findings underscore the influence of dietary habits, management models, and food diversity on food waste generation. Livestock product waste poses disproportionate environmental burdens, highlighting the need for targeted interventions such as portion control and educational campaigns on sustainable dining practices. These results provide valuable insights for policymakers aiming to align food waste reduction strategies with Sustainable Development Goal 12.3. Copyright © 2024 Zhang, Zhang, Xue and Wu.

AB  - With the progress of science and technology, humans’ ability to transform and create has been greatly enhanced, but so have the physical and mental ailments associated with environmental degradation and urbanization. Human survival and health are strongly linked to nature, and there is growing evidence that exposure to nature promotes health and well-being. However, there is currently a lack of synthesis among empirical studies on these aspects for the findings to be sufficient for informing public health strategies and social policy. Here, following basic guidelines for systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Scopus databases in January 2023. The results of our search and analysis show that nature can improve people’s health and well-being from two aspects: physical (reduces CVDs, increases immunity, improves autonomic nervous system function, and improves sleep quality) and psychological (restores attention, improves mood, reduces stress, and improves cognitive development). The ways in which people derive health from nature are varied, and tailored, personalized, symptom-specific exposure can further increase the health benefits. More importantly, it seems that people can gain the health benefits of nature by only being exposed to it for a short time. We incorporate the existing scientific evidence in our review and develop a new heuristic point of view on the necessity of exposure to natural environments for the health of individuals. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Reducing traffic energy consumption is crucial for smart cities, and vehicle carbon emissions are a key energy indicator. Traffic signal control (TSC) is a useful method because it can affect the energy consumption of vehicles on the road by controlling the stop-and-go of vehicles at traffic intersections. However, setting traffic signals to reduce energy consumption will affect traffic efficiency and this is not in line with traffic management objectives. Current studies adopt multi-objective optimization methods with high traffic efficiency and low carbon emissions to solve this problem. However, most methods use static weights, which cannot adapt to complex and dynamic traffic states, resulting in non-optimal performance. Current energy indicators for urban transportation often fail to consider passenger fairness. This fairness is significant because the purpose of urban transportation is to serve people’s mobility needs not vehicles. Therefore, this paper proposes Multi-objective Adaptive Meta-DQN TSC (MMD-TSC), which introduces a dynamic weight adaptation mechanism to simultaneously optimize traffic efficiency and energy saving, and incorporates the per capita carbon emissions as the energy indicator. Firstly, this paper integrates traffic state data such as vehicle positions, velocities, vehicle types, and the number of passengers and incorporates fairness into the energy indicators, using per capita carbon emissions as the target for reducing energy consumption. Then, it proposes MMD-TSC with dynamic weights between energy consumption and traffic efficiency as reward functions. The MMD-TSC model includes two agents, the TSC agent and the weight agent, which are responsible for traffic signal adjustment and weight calculation, respectively. The weights are calculated by a function of traffic states. Finally, the paper describes the design of the MMD-TSC model learning algorithm and uses a SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) v.1.20.0 for traffic simulation. The results show that in non-highly congested traffic states, the MMD-TSC model has higher traffic efficiency and lower energy consumption compared to static multi-objective TSC models and single-objective TSC models, and can adaptively achieve traffic management objectives. Compared with using vehicle average carbon emissions as the energy consumption indicator, using per capita carbon emissions achieves Pareto improvements in traffic efficiency and energy consumption indicators. The energy utilization efficiency of the MMD-TSC model is improved by 35% compared to the fixed-time TSC. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - With the growing demand for small urban green infrastructures (UGIs), knowing the public perception of small UGIs is important for future urban planning and decision-making. This study focusing on three small UGIs (a green roof, green wall, and small green lane in Guangzhou) explored residents' willingness to pay (WTP) for the maintenance of small UGIs and estimated their nonmarket value via travel cost method (TCM). Among 409 respondents from different neighborhoods, 80% were willing to pay for using and maintaining these UGIs. The aggregated annual WTP for investigated UGIs was approximately RMB 72.3 million per household, and the annual nonmarket value that the UGIs provided to human well-being was about RMB 74.5 million per household. Young respondents who might have lower incomes would like to pay more compared to elderly respondents. Among the five environmental issues investigated, people took air pollution as the most severe issue, and they preferred to pay more for air quality regulation services. To improve public understanding of small UGIs and their urban ecosystem services, education and publicity programs should be launched for various groups of people in the future. These findings will help city planners identify more effective designs for small UGIs, thus meeting societal preferences and demands.

AB  - Trees are a natural biofilitration approach to managing stormwater runoff for the development of green infrastructure that provides many community benefits as our urban areas expanding. These benefits include stormwater retention, erosion and pollution reduction, biodiversity and habitat restoration, esthetic and other environmental and social benefits. But growing a tree in the over-saturated soil (typical case during storm time) could kill a tree, too. On the other hand, 80% of the U.S. territory suffers at least a seasonal drought annually according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Trees and plants typically suffer much during droughts. This presentation will review the new irrigation technologies that are suitable for urban landscaping, which are quite different from farm fields. Conventionally, development of irrigation technologies is driven by agriculture industry so that these technologies are more suitable for farm use than for typical urban settings. For example, road median plantings are too difficult to use drip irrigation system because of legislation and logistics reasons. Irrigation systems can also be very cost inefficient compared to farm fields where acres of plants can share a system, while road median is the opposite in terms density of plantings. In addition, harsher environment and vandalism may cause damages. Novel irrigation technologies that are best for urban plantings and cope with the harsher growing urban environment will be discussed with case studies. The goal of this session is to educate and to recommend the best technologies for urban environments. The criteria include making best usage of natural precipitation water, stormwater holding and slow releasing capability, reducing labor cost, saving water, suppressing invasive species, and protecting plantings against harsher growing conditions than farms: heat island effect, excessive sunlight from reflections from buildings and road surfaces, limited soil volume, compacted soil, pollution from road maintenance and emission, vandalism, more flooding (within in the concrete forest), etc. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Understanding the impacts of urban expansion on ecosystem services (ESs) is important for sustainable development on regional and global scales. However, due to the uncertainty of future socioeconomic development and the complexity of urban expansion, assessing the impacts of future urban expansion on ESs remains challenging. In this study, we simulated the urban expansion in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) urban agglomeration in China from 2013 to 2040, and assessed its potential impacts on ESs based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and the Land Use Scenario Dynamics-urban (LUSD-urban) model. We found that urban land in the BTH urban agglomeration is expected to increase from 7605.25 km2 in 2013 to 9401.75–11,936.00 km2 in 2040. With continuing urban expansion, food production (FP), carbon storage (CS), water retention (WR), and air purification (AP) will decrease by 1.34–3.16%, 0.68–1.60%, 0.80–1.89%, and 0.37–0.87%, respectively. The conversion of cropland to urban land will be the main cause of ES losses. During 2013–2040, the losses of ESs caused by this conversion will account for 83.66–97.11% of the total losses in the whole region. Furthermore, the ES losses can cause considerable negative impacts on human well-being. The loss of FP will be equivalent to the food requirement of 3.68–8.61% of the total population in 2040, and the loss of CS will be 2.55–6.01% of the total standard coal consumption in 2013. To ensure sustainable development in the region, we suggest that effective policies and regulations should be implemented to protect cropland with high ES values from urban expansion. © 2017

AB  - Low impact development (LID) practices (e.g., green roofs, bioretention systems, and porous pavements) offer multiple benefits to urban eco-systems. They reduce the expenses associated with water treatment, grey infrastructure, and energy consumption and thus generate economic benefits. They also benefit the environment by mitigating air pollution and climate change, and they provide social benefits such as enhancing livability, urban green space, and educating and improving the health of the public. Many studies have attempted to calculate the monetary value of these benefits. However, few have considered all three types of benefits (i.e., economic, environmental, and social) or considered all of the different LID practices at a city-scale. This study develops a life cycle quantification framework to determine the monetary values of the three types of benefits and the life cycle net benefit of LID practices for a city. Applying the proposed framework to a case study of Hong Kong, the 30-year economic and environmental benefits are 5.3 billion USD and 1.2 billion USD, respectively. The mean and median social benefits are 35.1 billion USD and 49.6 billion USD, respectively. Subtracting the 30-year LID implementation cost (55.8 billion USD) produces a median positive net benefit of 2.3 billion USD with an annual unit value of 1.05 USD/m2 yr, and a mean negative net benefit of 12.2 billion USD with an annual unit value of −5.58 USD/m2 yr. Sensitivity analyses show that the net benefit is sensitive to the willingness to pay (WTP) of Hong Kong people, especially the WTP of the private sector, and the land cost of green roofs. Overall, this study provides a framework for quantifying and evaluating the life cycle cost, benefits, and net benefit of LID practices. The assumptions in the framework can be modified based on local information and applied to many other cities worldwide. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Following significant urban expansion, the ecological problems of resource-based cities are gradually exposed. It is of great significance to study the ecosystem services of resource-based cities to achieve their sustainable development goals and to alleviate the conflicts between environmental protection and the utilization of the surrounding resources. However, in the current research on resource-based cities, few scholars have combined multiple minerals and multiple ecosystem services to explore the impact of mineral resources on the ecosystem. In this study, based on the historical data spanning from 2002 to 2018, we used the CA–Markov model to project the land use of Panzhihua City to 2030. Based on future land use projection, we quantified four ecosystem services (ESs) variables, including water yield, carbon storage, habitat quality, and soil conservation, using the InVEST model from the perspective of land use evolution in Panzhihua City. In addition, we explored the trade-offs and synergies of different ecosystem services and the correlations between different mineral species and ecosystem services using Spearman’s correlation coefficient. Results showed the following: (1) During 2002–2018, water yield service, habitat quality service, and carbon storage service of Panzhihua City decreased year by year, and soil conservation service showed significant fluctuations; most of the low ESs areas were distributed in the central region of Panzhihua. On the contrary, most high ESs areas were located in the forest region. (2) The trade-offs and synergistic relationships among different ecosystem services showed significant spatial variations. There were synergistic relationships among ESs and weak trade-offs between water yield services, soil conservation, and habitat quality services. There was also significant spatial variability in the trade-offs and synergies among ecosystem services, with water production services showing “east trade-offs and west synergies” with soil conservation and habitat quality services, and most of the rest showing trade-offs in urban areas. (3) ESs in mining areas showed trade-offs in general, mainly between water production services and carbon storage services, with clay as the major negative factor of mineral species, and iron ore mines that have undergone ecological protection construction showed the lowest negative impact on ecology. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Fragmentation of natural landscapes during urbanization processes has been well-linked to biodiversity loss and changes in ecological and ecosystem function. Fragmentation can also have profound effects on provision of ecosystem services and on human social dynamics and well-being within cities. The ways in which ecological, ecosystem service, and social factors and the interactions among these are affected by fragmentation is not well-studied. Understanding these relationships is particularly important in cities where high densities of human population create intense and dynamic interactions within green spaces. Using the rapidly developing campus of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Mexico City as a case study, we examine the effects of natural area fragmentation over time on ecosystem services, human well-being, and biodiversity. We compare fragmentation of the campus natural areas between 1954 and 2015 to non-native plant species distribution maps, models of water infiltration, and mobility and citizen-science data. We found that the loss and fragmentation of the campus's natural areas has had varied effects on ecosystem services, and negative effects on human well-being and biodiversity. The relationships between fragmentation and ecosystem services depends on the ecosystem service being measured; water infiltration was negatively impacted by fragmentation but engagement with biodiversity was greatest in areas with a mix of natural and urban land covers. Our human well-being variable, mobility (the average travel time within the campus of walkers, bicyclists, and cars), was negatively affected by fragmentation. Walkers and cyclists spent significantly more time traveling across campus in 2015 compared to 1954. Finally, the most fragmented areas of the campus's natural areas support large populations of invasive exotic species, indicating negative effects of fragmentation on biodiversity. Although campus urban development is necessary for supporting the academic community at this growing university, we suggest a renewed focus on sustainable campus development in which land sparing in emphasized; connecting instructional, research, administrative, and other campus facilities within urban clusters and providing sustainable transport systems. Thus, eliminating further loss and fragmentation of the natural areas on campus, supporting both human well-being and the unique biodiversity of the region.

AB  - Quantifying and managing carbon (C) storage in urban green space (UGS) soils is associatedwith the ecosystem services necessary for human well-being and the national C inventory report ofthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Here, the soil C stocks at 30-cm depths indifferent types of UGS's (roadside, park, school forest, and riverside) were studied in three majorSouth Korean cities that have experienced recent, rapid development. The total C of 666 soil sampleswas analyzed, and these results were combined with the available UGS inventory data. Overall,the mean soil bulk density, C concentration, and C density at 30-cm depths were 1.22 g·cm-3,7.31 g·C· kg-1, and 2.13 kg·C·m-2, respectively. The UGS soil C stock (Gg· C) at 30-cm depths was105.6 for Seoul, 43.6 for Daegu, and 26.4 for Daejeon. The lower C storage of Korean UGS soilsthan those of other countries is due to the low soil C concentration and the smaller land area underUGS. Strategic management practices that augment the organic matter supply in soil are expected toenhance C storage in South Korean UGS soils. © 2016 by the authors.

AB  - The interplay between climate change and socio-economic activities has placed cities at the forefront of climate-related threats. Evaluating and enhancing urban climate resilience are widely regarded as effective strategies for mitigating and adapting to climate change. This study aims to develop a more logical, comprehensive, and replicable urban climate resilience assessment framework to accurately evaluate and enhance urban climate resilience, thereby supporting urban growth and development in climate change. Specifically, the study focused on the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration (YRDUA), a region with typical climate risks, using the driver-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) model to construct an urban climate resilience assessment framework and selecting evaluation indicators based on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including a new index: government climate policy concern. Subsequently, spatial autocorrelation, geographically and temporally weighted regression model, the coupling and coordination degree model, and the super-SBM model were applied. This approach revealed the spatial and temporal evolution trends, driving factors, coupling coordination degree, and construction efficiency of urban climate resilience in the YRDUA from 2013 to 2021. The results show that: (1) Urban climate resilience levels exhibited significant regional disparities, with a mean resilience score of 0.256 and an average annual growth rate of 1.21%. (2) A notable spatial correlation was observed in urban climate resilience, with the radius of the High-High cluster area expanding, while the radius of the Low-Low cluster area contracted. (3) The key factors driving urban climate resilience included water and forest coverage areas, climate policy concern, and investment in municipal public facilities construction. The impact of these factors displayed notable spatial heterogeneity. (4) The coupling coordination degree between resilience subsystems increased by 7.96%, yet remained on the verge of imbalance. Additionally, the average technical efficiency and scale efficiency of urban climate resilience construction rose by 7.43% and 5.44%, respectively, though significant room for improvement remains. Our research advocated for re-examining urban climate resilience through the lens of causality and sustainable development, offering valuable insights for policymakers in China and international initiatives. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The issue of ecosystem service (ES) decline due to the unfair consumption of natural capital in urban agglomerations (UAs) has been neglected. This study analysed the spatio-temporal differences characteristics of the three-dimensional ecological footprint and ES value. The Gini coefficient was used to construct a fairness evaluation framework based on physical and value accounting of natural capital consumption. Taking the Guanzhong Plain Urban Agglomeration (GPUA) as a case, the results show the GPUA consistently generated an ecological deficit. The natural capital stock is gradually being consumed. The natural capital consumption of a city matches its ecological carrying capacity and contributes to economic growth, the Gini coefficient of ES reached 0.4 in 2015 and 2017, indicating that the degree of unfairness is increasing. The ES-based evaluation more objectively reflects the fairness of natural capital consumption and ecological supply among cities. Using coefficient of ecological supply, ES value coefficient, economic contribution coefficient, and contribution coefficient of per capita income as the classification of city types helps to judge the fairness of the natural capital consumption of UAs. This framework helps deepen understanding of the coordinated relationship between UAs' socio-economic systems and ecosystems from the perspective of ecological supply and demand balance.

AB  - In addition to its benefits for air quality, climate protection and biodiversity, the potentials of urban green space for human health are also often highlighted in the literature. However, the empirical base concerning the impact of urban green space on well-being in Germany is still limited. This paper provides an empirical investigation of the effects of urban land use on well-being, and on mental and physical health, by merging data on the health status of residents from the Socioeconomic Panel (SOEP) for the years 2000 - 2012 and geo-coded land-use data from the European Urban Atlas (EUA). The results confirm a positive relation between improved access to urban green space and well-being and mental and physical health. In contrast, the presence of abandoned areas negatively affects residential well-being. Possible transmission channels for the positive effects of urban green spaces on health may be found in an increase in physical activities such as jogging and walking.

AB  - With the acceleration of global urbanization, the ecosystem services (ES) and ecological balance of nature reserves have been significantly impacted. However, quantitative assessments of the multiple contributions of nature reserves to urban ecological sustainability are still lacking. This study selects Panjin, a wetland city in China (3788 km2), as the study area, utilizing the InVEST model to quantify ES (water yield, carbon storage, soil retention, and habitat quality), and employing redundancy analysis to explore the influencing factors. Ecological source areas were identified, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) score was calculated to systematically evaluate the contribution of nature reserves. The results indicate that from 1990 to 2010, the built-up area of Panjin increased by approximately 159%, leading to a reduction in carbon storage, soil retention, and habitat quality by 20%, 4%, and 14%, respectively. From 2010 to 2020, ecological restoration policies resulted in a 63% increase in ES compared to 2010. Nature reserves played a crucial role in maintaining ecological stability, providing over 40% of the ecological source areas while occupying only 24% of the city’s area and contributing more than 30% to the overall urban ecological sustainability. This study is the first to systematically assess the multiple contributions of nature reserves to urban ecological sustainability, providing ecological management recommendations for policymakers based on innovative environmental indicators and methods to support sustainable urban development. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Given the interrelated problems of climate change, energy and resource scarcity, and the challenge of supporting critical natural systems in cities, urban dwellers may be exceptionally vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. While a number of programs and policies have been developed and implemented to help reduce the environmental and social impacts of climate change on communities, we argue that effective and sustainable programs must not only consider how the changing environment impacts communities, but also how communities interact with and impact the environment. Specifically, drawing on a case study of the needs assessment of the Healthy Soils for Healthy Communities Initiative conducted in Los Angeles (LA) County, CA as a model for a Virtuous Cycle Framework, we attempted to better understand how urban residents interact with land, green spaces, and soil as a means of finding ways to address some of the environmental and health disparities that many urban residents experience, while also exploring ways to improve soil health to support its capacity to provide essential ecosystem services (e.g., carbon sequestration, water filtration, food and biomass production). A unique feature of our approach is that it involved an interdisciplinary and multi-level partnership composed of a well-established environmental organization dedicated to urban forestry, environmental justice, and climate resilience, university faculty researchers who study human behavior and human-nature relationships, government partners, and, most importantly, community members, among others. The first step in understanding how community members interact with their environment involved collecting survey and focus group data from residents of LA County to assess attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors around land and soil. Results were used to explore strategies for deepening community engagement, addressing knowledge gaps, and shaping policies that would benefit not just people who live/work in LA, but also the soil and other natural systems that rely on soil. This article integrates our previously published survey and focus group findings with new results that pertain specifically to the Virtuous Cycle Framework, and demonstrates how the data are being used to inform our community-based interventions (e.g., policy change, public education and community engagement, and demonstration projects).

AB  - Green stormwater infrastructure has been demonstrated as an innovative water resources management approach that addresses multiple challenges facing urban environments. However, there is little consensus on what policy strategies can be used to best incentivize green infrastructure adoption by private landowners. Game theory, an analysis framework that has historically been under-utilized within the context of stormwater management, is uniquely suited to address this policy question. We used a cooperative game theory framework to investigate the potential impacts of different policy strategies used to incentivize green infrastructure installation. The results indicate that municipal regulation leads to the greatest reduction in pollutant loading. However, the choice of the "best" regulatory approach will depend on a variety of different factors including politics and financial considerations. Large, downstream agents have a disproportionate share of bargaining power. Results also reveal that policy impacts are highly dependent on agents' spatial position within the stormwater network, leading to important questions of social equity and environmental justice.

AB  - Promoting energy conservation and emission reduction and achieving carbon peak and carbon neutrality is a systematic project that requires the joint efforts of the whole society. Accurate measurement and analysis of the basic state and spatial correlation of urban -rural carbon emissions is the basic prerequisite for formulating the "double carbon" policy. This study aims to analyze the regional disparities in urban -rural carbon emissions in China from 2005 to 2021 and to assess the degree of inequality in such emissions. The IPCC methodology was employed to calculate the carbon emissions of urban and rural areas in each province. The Theil coefficient was utilized to delineate the spatial evolution of urban -rural carbon emission disparities in China. The decomposition of the Theil index was adopted to investigate the sources and shifts in spatial disparities. The local Moran's I was applied to analyze the spatial correlation of urban and rural carbon emissions in China. Additionally, the Theil index was employed to measure the degree of urban -rural carbon emission inequality in each province. Based on the natural breakpoint grading method, the spatial heterogeneity of the urban -rural carbon emission inequality across various Chinese provinces was scrutinized. Findings: China's urban -rural carbon emission inequality exhibited a three-phase transformation, predominantly influenced by intraregional factors, with the Northeast region making a significant contribution. Spatially, eastern coastal and inland provinces like Hebei and Shandong exhibited higher carbon emissions, whereas western provinces such as Gansu and Qinghai showed lower levels. The majority of regions witnessed their emission disparities transition from mid -low to mid -high. However, challenges related to insufficient and imbalanced development remained prominent. Specifically, economically advanced regions like Guangdong and Jiangsu manifested substantial emission disparities, while western provinces like Sichuan displayed smaller disparities.

AB  - Ecologically fragile areas, which are vulnerable to human disturbances, are facing development dilemmas due to the contradiction between economic development and environmental degradation. Examining the driving mechanism and future trends of land use transitions can inform territorial planning and land use policies to address the contradiction. However, research into the mechanisms governing the interaction between ecological and social factors driving land use transitions in ecologically fragile areas is currently limited. Considering the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River Economic Belt (URYREB), a typical ecologically fragile area in China, as an example, this study discussed the spatio-temporal evolution characteristics and driving mechanisms of UrbanAgricultural-Ecological Space. The results indicated that ecological factors influence the direction, location, and scale of spatial evolution, while social factors dominate the direction and scale of spatial evolution. The interaction between ecological and social elements drives spatial evolution due to the endogenous development needs of the social-ecological system (SES), in conjunction with external policy guidance and economic development. In the future, urban function space may continue to expand and threaten surrounding agricultural function space, thus, corresponding land use policies are necessary to ensure food security. This study unveils the impact of multifactor interactions on land use transitions and offers insights for optimizing territorial space planning in ecologically fragile areas.

AB  - The paper has comprehensively studied and evaluated urban garden afforestation, which integrated a comprehensive index-system to evaluate including ecological environment benefit, economic benefit, and social benefit, as well as deduced the Algorithm of PLS-SEM (Partial least squares – structural equation modeling) path evaluation model about comprehensive assessment. Afforestation in urban areas results in the reduction of local biodiversity, the potentially invasive species, and lost revenue from agriculture. Advanced planning and management could allow the coexistence of urban forestry and nature. The paper took the urban garden afforestation in Harbin as a case study and conducted a single-dimensional test and reliability and validity test on the construction of evaluation index system, and also verified its scientificity. On this basis, we obtained relevant parameters of middle-external structure and internal structure in the PLS-SEM path model, as well as the integrated level of urban garden afforestation in Harbin. The observational outcomes study the comprehensive evaluation of urban garden afforestation and the evaluation index system of urban garden afforestation is constructed. © 2022

AB  - Historically, environmental degradationEnvironmental degradation has often been the cost of concomitant urbanisation and industrialisationIndustrialisation. China is no exception. Although China’s GDPGross Domestic Product (GDP) has maintained the fastest average growth worldwide over the past four decades, the country has encountered multifaceted environmental challenges, with its ecosystemsEcosystem and biodiversity undergoing large-scale disruption. Since the 1990s, the central government has ushered in a series of campaignsCampaign, policies, and regulations focusing on an environmental agendaEnvironmental agenda at different levels. This chapter tracks the shifting propositions of green infrastructure in China’s efforts during the eco-cities movement at the beginning of the 2000s and under the most recent Sustainable Development ZonesSustainable Development Zone (SDZ) (SDZs) initiative in 2016. This chapter analyzes the various planning principles, design approaches, and environmental, economic, and social considerations involved in the development of green infrastructure, both conceptually and through the lens of practice, in China’s search for a sustainable urban development model. Case analyses, comparative studies, and data analytics from social media are employed as research methods to examine how the concepts of environmental sustainability and green infrastructure have been evolving under the influence of locational dynamics and temporal characteristics in China. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.

AB  - Urbanization has often been considered a threat to food security since it is likely to reduce the availability of croplands. Using spatial statistics and scenario analysis, we show that an increase in China's urbanization level from 56% in 2015 to 80% in 2050 would actually release 5.8 million hectares of rural land for agricultural production-equivalent to 4.1% of China's total cropland area in 2015. Even considering the relatively lower land fertility of these new croplands, crop production in 2050 would still be 3.1-4.2% higher than in 2015. In addition, cropland fragmentation could be reduced with rural land release and a decrease in rural population, benefiting large-scale farming and environmental protection. To ensure this, it is necessary to adopt an integrated urban-rural development model, with reclamation of lands previously used as residential lots. These insights into the urbanization and food security debate have important policy implications for global regions undergoing rapid urbanization. Using spatial statistics and scenario analysis, Wang et al. identify the rural land most suitable for crop production in more than 2,800 Chinese counties. They estimate that a targeted increase in China's urbanization level could release almost 6 million hectares of rural land for agriculture.

AB  - Urbanization processes spur the need for urban green infrastructure (GI) to support the well-being of urban dwellers and underpin a sustainable planning strategy. It is a challenge for urban planning to make cities equitable in a socio-spatial way for which strategic planning are demanded based on measured gradients of spatial equity for GI. Strategically, urban GI planning should pay tribute to the inherent spatial patterns and foster a fair distribution of GI towards spatial equity. Our aim is hence to investigate the spatial patterns of urban GI and disclose how spatial patterns affect spatial equity of GI in typical residential areas. The sample sites are in a central European city, Leipzig, the fastest growing city in Germany at present, with high pressure on urban growth. To elaborate an innovative approach, this study draws up a cascade of three methodological stages: 1) deploy the approach of an urban Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) to compare urban GI patterns in three typical residential local districts, 2) use the GI-adapted Gini coefficient to measure spatial equity of GI distributions, and 3) explore the relationships between GI spatial patterns and spatial equity of GI for each residential type. In the context of three typical residential areas in Leipzig (i.e. (semi-)detached houses, linear multistorey housing estates, and perimeter blocks), a combination of the MSPA and a spatial equity measurement assists our novel exploration to disclose the relationships between the spatial patterns and the equity of GI distributions. Thus, we can prove strong similarities on the characteristics of spatial patterns in each residential type and observe a tendency of increasing equity from (semi-)detached houses to linear housing and further to perimeter blocks. As significant findings for the support of strategic urban GI planning, we discover that GI cores provide a restricted increase of spatial equity that limited to the lack of space. Furthermore, we suggest more GI bridges to enhance structural connectivity as well as spatial equity. This paper depicts the spatial equity of GI distributions in typical residential areas from morphological perspective, and thus further underpins urban GI planning for strategic networks as a key principle of the urban GI concept.

AB  - Coastal rural communities worldwide face many challenges not only related to climate change but also extreme events, environmental degradation, population growth or aging, and conflict usage of the ecosystem. Historically, the economies of coastal communities have been based on the exploitation of natural resources, thus shaping its socioeconomic development. This has led to some limitations in the way these communities can now adapt to climate change. In Canada, coastal communities are increasingly dealing with climate change consequences. Sea level rise, coastal erosion, and increasing frequency in storm surges threaten the fragility of both natural and human systems. Various approaches have been used to try to reduce the vulnerability and improve adaptive capacity of communities. One approach, promoted by many organizations including the United Nations, is ecosystem-based adaptation. This approach is part of the series of nature-based solutions that help social-ecological systems become more resilient; by promoting biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services, this approach also relates to principles of community engagement and supports adaptive governance and social inclusion. This paper describes and analyzes these principles and considers strategies for ensuring community engagement. Combining ecosystem-based adaptation with a strong community engagement can enhance the long-term sustainability of the social-ecological system.

AB  - This paper has the aim to analyze the implications that urban sustainability, socio-ecosystems, and ecosystem services have as the bases to design the urban green growth strategies. The method used is the analytic based on the theoretical and conceptual literature reviews on the topics described. A qualitative analysis offers better knowledge outcomes than a quantitative analysis using models that are based on a limited subset of implications between sustainability, socio-ecosystems, and ecosystem services with strong limitations because uncertainties and ambiguities are difficult to quantify if not impossible. Urban sustainability and environmental performance integrates biodiversity and socio-ecosystems for the provision of better quality ecosystem services supported by green infrastructure design into the green projects aimed to achieve economic and environmental benefits. It is concluded that the ecosystem services and human well-being may suffer irreversible severe declines if sustainability is not built based on biodiversity of socio-ecosystems, green infrastructure, and natural capital. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Impact assessment is a key step in mainstreaming urban nature-based solutions (NBS). Yet, it remains unclear if and how assessment frameworks influence urban planning, design and management. We contend that the potential of current NBS assessment frameworks is not fully exploited due to: (1) limited contextualisation of monitoring and assessment to place-specific contexts and (2) the depoliticisation of co-production. To address this, we present a practical five-step action framework to guide inclusive participation across different stages of monitoring and assessment of urban NBS, including indicator selection. Unlike previous approaches, applying selection criteria at the level of individual indicators, we also use criteria at the aggregate level of the indicator set. We conclude that participatory assessment contributes to mainstreaming urban NBS for sustainable and just cities, provided data is contextualised to local decision-making contexts and the process is designed to amplify marginalised voices.

AB  - This study examines the over 7500 urban heat island (UHI) mitigation actions that cities and local authorities included in their action plans as signatories of the Global Covenant of Mayors. The analysis reveals that the majority of the actions deal with greenery and water-based technologies, with very limited use of combinatorial approaches that may deliver higher and longer lasting positive effects by tackling different sources of urban heat. Costs vary according to the category of action, while the timeline for implementation is typically between 4 and 10 years. A number of cities that indicate extreme heat as a hazard of growing intensity and/or frequency are not reporting any precaution against UHI which calls for prioritization in the near future. The analysis further unveils that, while UHI actions typically target a variety of hazards (e.g. extreme heat, droughts, wildfires) and sectors (e.g. buildings, biodiversity, land use planning), limited is the attention to specific vulnerable population groups. We argue that, in light of a just transition to climate resiliency, specific and consistent adaptation plans are of utmost importance.

AB  - Europe is a highly urbanised continent. The consequent loss and degradation of urban and peri-urban green space could adversely affect ecosystems as well as human health and well-being. The aim of this paper is to formulate a conceptual framework of associations between urban green space, and ecosystem and human health. Through an interdisciplinary literature review the concepts of Green Infrastructure, ecosystem health, and human health and well-being are discussed. The possible contributions of urban and peri-urban green space systems, or Green Infrastructure, on both ecosystem and human health are critically reviewed. Finally, based on a synthesis of the literature a conceptual framework is presented. The proposed conceptual framework highlights many dynamic factors, and their complex interactions, affecting ecosystem health and human health in urban areas. This framework forms the context into which extant and new research can be placed. In this way it forms the basis for a new interdisciplinary research agenda. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Urban greenspace (UGS) provides residents with various ecosystem services, which contribute to improving the quality of life and health of urban residents. Therefore, UGS plays an important role in urban livability and sustainability. We reviewed studies of UGS accessibility and the effects of UGS on the well-being of urban residents, focusing on the methods for evaluating UGS accessibility, major findings on the relationship between UGS accessibility and residents' PGS use, health, and socioeconomic status, and evaluations of greenspace provisioning in terms of meeting the demand of residents. We found that the major approaches for estimating UGS accessibility include methods based on administrative or census units, distance to the nearest UGS, service area, and gravity-based models. Numerous studies have confirmed the positive relations between accessibility of UGS and its use by residents and its effect on human health. However, the spatial distributions of UGS across a city, especially the urban-suburban gradient, are often uneven. Some studies have found that socioeconomically disadvantaged residents have a lower UGS accessibility, but this finding does not necessarily hold true across the world. We then put forward several suggestions to improve these studies. Future research should quantify the characteristics of UGS, including biodiversity and landscape patterns, and investigate the effects of these factors on the well-being of residents. Studies should include other types of UGS besides parks, and other aspects of human well-being besides health. Numerous case studies should be undertaken in different regions and at different scales to enable comparisons between different socioeconomic and cultural context. Longitudinal studies based on multi-temporal UGS patterns and cohort studies witll provide insights into the dynamic relationship between UGS and the well-being of residents. Furthermore, such studies will clarify how socioeconomic processes affect this relationship, which will support urban planning and management. © 2019 Shengtai Xuebao/ Acta Ecologica Sinica.

AB  - In a highly structured environment, as an urban centre, there are impacts for both humans and the environment. The urban heat island effect and energy poverty are impacts of this situation. A common way to deal with the last two impacts is to reduce the temperature by using bioclimatic design. This research is the subject of a project at the Technical University of Crete about the use of urban gardens as a way to reduce the air and surface temperature in Chania, and more specifically in the district of Chalepa. The threats to biodiversity and the idea of urban gardens are presented. In this research, a scenario with absence of vegetation, the current state and two scenarios with different vegetation in urban gardens are analyzed. The first scenario involves horticulture species and the second one the cultivation of aromatic and medicinal species. These scenarios were examined using the numerical model Envi-met after the collection of data needed such as the height of buildings, vegetation characteristics, the location of the area etc. Finally, the scenarios of urban gardens decreased the surface temperature by 10 degrees C from the scenario with absence of vegetation and 5 degrees C from the current state in days of high temperature. However, the differences between these two scenarios were not of great importance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Vegetated green infrastructure (GI) is used as a sustainable complement to traditional stormwater infrastructure in many cities and is reported to provide additional benefits such as heat island mediation, crime reduction, increased property values, improved air quality, improved human well-being, improved aesthetics, biodiversity conservation, and carbon sequestration. However, we hypothesize that the simultaneous provisioning of multiple benefits - multifunctionality - is not guaranteed yet may be achieved by planning two critical components of GI: the spatial placement of GI within a city and the traits of the plant species used to vegetate GI. We propose the Green Infrastructure Space and Traits (GIST) model, a new planning tool for evaluating and maximizing GI multifunctionality based on optimizing both site selection and plant traits in GI design to promote urban planning with higher sustainability and benefits to humans. GIST involves identifying priority areas for GI placement and using plant species with traits that maximize benefits and multifunctionality in priority areas. As a case study, we apply GIST to Philadelphia, USA, and identify new locations for GI and plant traits that would increase multifunctionally across the city. For the nine benefits we examined, GIST indicates high potential for multifunctionality for the Philadelphia GI system. An assessment of the GI planning in Philadelphia to date indicates that the actualization of this multifunctionality has not been fully realized and could be improved with strategic GI placement and plant species selection. Further, we identified a cluster of correlated benefits which may be a common pathway for multifunctionality across cities. Overall, our work supports the hypothesis that multifunctional GI is possible when proper planning tools that integrate spatial placement and plant traits are used.

AB  - Australia is one of the world’s most urbanised countries, with 90% of its population residing in cities and towns. Sydney and Melbourne alone have populations with over 4 million; and by 2030 this figure is expected to reach 6 million. Australia is vulnerable to food supply shortages and inequalities, especially in cities. Its ability to feed itself, alongside its share of the global population, is already challenged, and this is expected to become even more so given population growth trends. A 2010 Senate inquiry into food security and the Prime Minister’s Science, Engineering and Innovation Council (PMSEIC) have both drawn attention to these issues. These reports identified that Australia already imports much of its food supply, and a “just in time” supply chain from global producers to local supermarkets is vulnerable to global shocks in production and distribution. The combined impacts of global warming, soil erosion, desertification, drought and population increase are also significant challenges for securing Australia’s food system, leading to continued loss of arable land (Lawrence et al., 2012). © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Lynda Shevellar and Peter Westoby; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - Over 60% of the global population are expected to live in urban areas by 2050. Urban blue spaces are critical for biodiversity, provide a range of ecosystem services, and can promote human health and wellbeing. Despite this, access to blue space is often unequally distributed across socioeconomic gradients, and the availability of quality blue space could extend to environmental justice issues. Three stages of analysis were carried out in Mexico City, Mexico and Bristol, UK to (i) assess associations between blue space and socioeconomic metrics at a regional scale, (ii) apply a rapid assessment tool to assess amenity, access and environmental quality, (iii) consider local quality across socioeconomic gradients at a regional scale. Still water availability was indicative of higher socioeconomic status, but contrasting city evolutions underpinned differences. Locally, there were environmental gradients from more complex to disturbed habitats that influenced potential wellbeing and amenity benefits. In combination, this may exacerbate inequalities and risk increasing ecosystem disservices. If cities are to be socially, and environmentally resilient to higher levels of disturbance in the future, healthy ecosystems will be key. However, further research is needed to address various dimensions of injustice in urban areas beyond blue space distribution. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Creating sustainable urban landscapes in light of growing population pressures requires interdisciplinary multi-functional solutions. Alternative agro-ecosystems described as food forests, permaculture gardens, and/or edible landscapes among others could offer potential ways to address the social, economic, and ecological goals of various stakeholders simultaneously. Current research is lacking a comprehensive tool that can assess the performance of alternative agro-ecosystems that have both functional and aesthetic values. The present research uses a novel rubric, the Permaculture and Agro-ecosystems Sustainability Scorecard (PASS) that combines agricultural sustainability and ecosystem services (ES) indicators in order to assess alternative agro-ecosystems. The rubric evaluates provisioning, regulating, supporting, economic and cultural ES and includes benefits such as pollinator presence, increased biodiversity, alternative pesticides and fertilizer use, carbon sequestration, food security, and human interactions. Based on the concepts and principles drawn from four popular frameworks and sub-disciplines, namely, SAFE, SITES, permaculture, and agroecology, we identify sixteen broad ES indicators and 59 sub-indices and measure them using data collected through site observation, survey, interviews, and documentary research. For easy comparison across different urban agriculture sites, the above sub-indices are further aggregated into five ES criteria using stakeholder-informed weights. The weights are developed through pair-wise comparison of criteria by sample survey respondents. The PASS framework is used to score twelve sites in South Florida that meet specific criteria in the small farm, residential, and public space categories. Sample respondents place the highest weight on cultural services. Contrary to the popular notion of promoting urban agriculture for food security, the results show that the majority of the sites score highest in the supporting services provided, followed by regulating and cultural services, and lowest in the economic services category. The supporting service for most of the sample sites score consistently very high, close to the highest possible level of 5.0. There is a wide variation in provisioning and economic values across the study sites. The paper offers several ideas for mainstreaming the ES indicators into urban planning and decision-making and some of the practical difficulties one might face along the way. We conclude that in order to realize the broader ES benefits of urban agriculture in particular and agro-ecosystems in general, a multi-pronged policy and planning approach is necessary.

AB  - With increasing urbanization and environmental degradation, urban landscapes are increasingly expected to provide a wide range of ecosystem services typically associated with rural areas, including biodiversity conservation and food production. Because residential landscapes constitute the largest single urban land use, domestic gardens have emerged as a topic of research interest and planning concern. The ecosystem services (or disservices) these landscapes provide, however, have not been rigorously measured, nor have tradeoffs between the services they provide been assessed. In this study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 59 African American, Chinese-origin or Mexican-origin households with on-lot or vacant lot food gardens in Chicago. Crop plants and cultivated ornamental plants on the lot were inventoried and mapped at the species level. A total of 123 edible plant taxa from 25 families and 288 ornamental plant species from 85 families were identified, for a combined total of 387 species from 90 families. Cumulatively, the gardens of African American households were relatively rich in ornamental plant species and families, while those of Chinese-origin households had a depauperate flora. Crop plant richness was more even across sample types. Shade trees and a developed shrub layer were absent from most gardens, possibly representing a trade off in ecosystem services in favor of food production. The richness of the aggregate 2.1 ha of residential property inventoried in this study was comparable with or exceeded that of a 34 ha prairie remnant west of Chicago. However, only 35 (9.6%) of the inventoried species were native to the Chicago area.

AB  - Ecosystem services (ESs) are closely related to human well-being (HWB). Recently, urbanization has increased worldwide, which has had a significant impact on the ecosystem service supply-demand (ESSD) and HWB. However, previous studies have primarily focused on the spatiotemporal pattern of ESSD and HWB, while ignoring their evolutionary pathways, especially in karst areas. We aimed to quantify the optimal trade-offs of ESSD under the constraints of urbanization and the nonlinear relationship between ESSD and HWB, further constructing a tree-like framework to explore the evolutionary pathways of urbanization, ESSD, and HWB from a landscape evolution perspective. We used the production possibility frontier (PPF) to quantify the optimal trade-offs of three ESSDs, the generalized additive model (GAM) to fit the nonlinear relationship between ESSD and HWB, and the geographic evolution tree model (Geotree) to construct the tree-like structure of urbanization levels, comprehensive ecosystem service supply-demand (CESD), and HWB. There is a trade-off between the deficit of carbon storage services (CS) and water yield services (WY), but a synergy between the deficit of WY and the surplus of FS. Further, there is a synergy between the deficit of CSs and the surplus of food supply services (FS). The response of HWB to the ESSD of CS is not obvious, but the response to the ESSD of WY and FS is obvious. Based on the Geotree model, the urbanization, CESD, and HWB present strong coupling relationships, which show the characteristics of clustering, stratified heterogeneity, and evolution.

AB  - With global warming forecast to continue into the foreseeable future, heat waves are very likely to increase in both frequency and intensity. In urban regions, these future heat waves will be exacerbated by the urban heat island effect, and will have the potential to negatively influence the health and welfare of urban residents. In order to investigate the health effects of the urban heat island (UHI) in Shanghai, China, 30 years of meteorological records (1975-2004) were examined for 11 first- and second-order weather stations in and around Shanghai. Additionally, automatic weather observation data recorded in recent years as well as daily all-cause summer mortality counts in 11 urban, suburban, and exurban regions (1998-2004) in Shanghai have been used. The results show that different sites (city center or surroundings) have experienced different degrees of warming as a result of increasing urbanization. In turn, this has resulted in a more extensive urban heat island effect, causing additional hot days and heat waves in urban regions compared to rural locales. An examination of summer mortality rates in and around Shanghai yields heightened heat-related mortality in urban regions, and we conclude that the UHI is directly responsible, acting to worsen the adverse health effects from exposure to extreme thermal conditions. © ISB 2009.

AB  - Urban trees provide a range of ecosystem services, including air purification. This specific ecosystem service can be quantified using i-Tree Eco software, but the software has some limitations. One limitation is that the pollution model used in the software cannot take into account spatial differences in pollutant concentrations, which occur in every city due to the diversity of polluters. This study aimed to investigate to what extent this limitation of the i-Tree Eco pollution model can influence the results obtained. The study was conducted in such a way that the i-Tree Eco project was broken down into four sub-projects, in which data on the concentration of selected pollutants from different air quality monitoring stations were analyzed using the coefficient of variation (CV). Three stations were designated as "urban background" type stations and one was a "traffic" type station. The study revealed relatively low variation (0.05 < CV < 0.23) in estimated quantities obtained based on concentrations of pollutants retrieved from different air quality monitoring stations of the same type ("urban background" type stations) and relatively high variation (0.24 < CV < 0.57) in estimated quantities obtained on data retrieved from different types of stations ("urban background" versus "traffic"). When data on air pollutant concentrations used in the model is from the "traffic" station type, trees provide air purification ecosystem services with an annual value almost twice as high (EUR 310 000) as when the data used is from "urban background" stations type (EUR 165 000). The results highlight the importance of ensuring that appropriate air pollution data for running a particular type of i-Tree Eco project is used.

AB  - Home gardens are traditional agroforestry systems that promote plant diversity and ecosystem services while also having direct and positive impacts on human livelihoods. Even though home gardens are considered biodiversity hotspots and have recently been recognised as essential for their role in tropical biodiversity conservation, the benefits of ecosystem services provided by home gardens are understudied. This study investigated plant diversity and ecosystem services in tropical home gardens in the Aceh Timur region of Indonesia. Data was collected from 180 home gardens in 12 villages and recorded 173 plant species associated with 16 ecosystem services. The majority of the cultivated plants were fruit and vegetable plants, which played an important role in supporting food security and household income. Home gardens, with their plant species diversity and ecosystem services, played an important role in biodiversity conservation. Home gardens were important not only for improving household livelihoods, but also for the conservation of plant genetic resources and nearby protected forests. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Green roofs have been heralded as a "sustainable building practice" in cities throughout the world as one response to mounting environmental stresses. A range of stressors plus erosion of aesthetics and human well being in urban areas have initiated policies and practices often with incentives to develop green infrastructure such as green roofs. They provide a suite of public and private benefits most of which map onto services generally provided by the ecosystem. Green roof development imbeds in environmental design processes and is constrained by both human and environmental factors. As relatively small, simple, anthropogenic ecosystems, green roofs relate to several existing conceptual and applied ecological ideas. Understanding and applying from ecology and ecosystem studies, ecological engineering, managed ecosystems, construction ecology, urban ecology, landscape ecology, restoration ecology, reconciliation ecology, soil ecology and community ecology show green roof ecosystems can be created to cycle energy and nutrients. Furthermore, green roofs can be constructed to model an ecosystem and may provide a setting for testing ecological concepts. This book takes an ecosystems approach to describing a large number of interactions on green roofs placing them in the total human ecosystem.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NbS) can synergistically improve human well-being and biodiversity in urban areas by enhancing ecosystem functions and services. Scaling out NbS, understood as the widespread application of NbS in multiple contexts, is an important policy ambition to increase the number of people and regions benefiting from NbS. However, designing scaling-out strategies requires considering critical aspects of the nexus between NbS and ecosystem services (ES) supply to yield large-scale benefits effectively. The aim of the study is twofold: (i) to simulate the stepwise implementation of multiple NbS and (ii) to quantify their cumulative impacts on ES supply and beneficiaries. The NbS implementation was guided by a method that prioritizes different NbS types in multiple sites, by combining spatial information on ES demand and land suitability with a qualitative description of ES supply by NbS type. The cumulative impacts were computed stepwise using GIS modeling. The study was conducted in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Spain), focusing on five types of NbS (urban forests, urban parks, community gardens, infiltration ponds), and five ES (runoff mitigation, stormwater treatment, soil erosion control, recreation, and food supply). Overall, 179 NbS were simulated in 130 sites distributed in the city. The findings showed an improvement in all services, albeit significant increments occurred only for certain services. We observed a non-linear relationship between NbS and impacts, including constant, positive, and negative trends. We discussed several factors that were determinants of impacts, providing insights on how to design scaling-out strategies from the biophysical perspective. Moreover, we reflected on the role of multifunctionality, social preferences, and economic feasibility as prioritization criteria for NbS. Finally, we addressed the imple-mentation of NbS scaling-out strategies from a broader perspective, deepening governance, economic and planning challenges, and potential actions for the case study.

AB  - Urban farming activities is markedly increasing with expectation to strengthen the food security in the cities, however, the crop safety and the environmental sustainability of farming activities is questioned. To address environmental sustainability, examination of river water quality and pesticide residue both in the water and crop production in periurban areas of Great Bandung were carried out. STORET index were used to identify the quality of water source with reference to Indonesia Ministry of Environment as well as the biodiversity index to ensure the health of aquatic ecosystem. The results showed that the urban farming practices had utilized clean and uncontaminated water sources to irrigate the land. The good quality of water sources could be maintained even after urban farming activities. The diversity of plankton and macrozoobenthos were relatively increasing, with low-medium level of diversity (H' index = 0.3 - 2.9), even in the downstream areas after farming land. None of pesticide residues were found in the crop products. The crops from peri-urban farming of the Great Bandung were safely consumed. Meanwhile, the sustainability of urban farming in the peripheral areas of Great Bandung might be lasted so far as the upstream river pollution from the city could be well-maintained. © 2023 WITPress.

AB  - Cities are at the forefront of the battle against climate change. However, intercity comparisons and responsibility allocations among cities are hindered because cost- and time-effective methods to calculate the carbon footprints of global cities have yet to be developed. Here, we establish a hybrid method integrating top-down input–output analysis and bottom-up crowdsourced data to estimate the carbon footprints of global cities. Using city purchasing power as the main predictor of the carbon footprint, we estimate the carbon footprints of 465 global cities in 2020. Those cities comprise 10% of the global population but account for 18% of the global carbon emissions showing a significant concentration of carbon emissions. The Gini coefficients are applied to show that global carbon inequality is less than income inequality. In addition, the increased carbon emissions that come from high consumption lifestyles offset the carbon reduction by efficiency gains that could result from compact city design and large city scale. Large climate benefits could be obtained by achieving a low-carbon transition in a small number of global cities, emphasizing the need for leadership from globally important urban centres. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Areas of high tree canopy cover, especially connected tree canopy cover, provide habitat to support biodiversity and cooling to ameliorate the urban heat island effect. However, the nature-based solutions provided by trees are not distributed equally; land use contributes to this systematic inequality because the places where it is easiest to plant trees are often not where trees are needed most. To better understand the gaps and opportunities for tree planting across the urban landscape, we examine the distribution of tree canopy cover and connectivity by land use in 10 U.S. cities. We find that parks have the greatest tree canopy coverage followed by single-family residential areas, multi-family residential areas, and industrial land uses. On average, single-family neighborhoods had 8.5 % points more tree canopy coverage than multi-family neighborhoods, with gaps as high as 18.6 % points. Looking at the size of connected tree canopy, we find that residential land uses are home to more small contiguous tree canopy patches (>1 ha in area), while parks have more large contiguous tree canopy (>12 ha in area). We compare the contiguous tree canopy findings to tree planting policy in each city to examine the influence of intentional planning for tree connectivity, and close with policy-oriented implications of our results. Namely, we suggest: 1) closing the gap between single-family and multi-family tree canopy cover, 2) factoring connectivity into tree planting and preservation, and 3) taking a context-specific approach to increase tree cover in industrial areas in order to more equitably distribute the climate, ecological, and health benefits of trees. © 2024 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Urban water systems are increasingly vulnerable to climate change. Traditional planning, often based on past conditions, fails to address these new challenges. We suggest policy options for integrating climate scenarios into urban water planning, which will enhance the resilience of drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater systems. The policy options are (1) requiring climate scenario analysis in planning processes, (2) developing climate-resilient infrastructure standards, (3) promoting low-impact development and nature-based solutions, (4) creating regional planning bodies, (5) educating professionals for climate-responsive planning, and (6) securing funding for climate adaptation. We discuss our experience in the state of Utah, USA, and summarize case studies in Copenhagen, New York, and Melbourne. The policy options align with Sustainable Development Goals and offer a roadmap for building adaptable, sustainable urban water systems.

AB  - Urban wetlands provide vital ecological services, yet their hydrogeochemical dynamics and associated risks remain insufficiently explored, especially within urban contexts. This study aims to evaluate the Inciralti-Cakalburnu Urban Wetland (ICUW) in Izmir, Turkey, as a case study for understanding the complex interactions between water quality, contamination risks, and urban development. The ICUW, a unique example of a natural coastal urban wetland, offers critical services such as flood regulation, water purification, and carbon sequestration, while also being vulnerable to contamination from agricultural runoff, seawater and geothermal water intrusion. Key findings include significant variations in water quality parameters: pH values range from 6.73 to 9.00, electrical conductivity (EC) from 911 to 61,700 μS/cm, and total dissolved solids (TDS) from 631 to 42,935 mg/L. Notably, concentrations of heavy metals such as arsenic (0.002–0.0048 mg/L), boron (0.060–39.6 mg/L), bromide (0.100–80.8 mg/L), fluoride (0.130–4.2 mg/L) and nitrate (0.5–193 mg/L) exceed recommended levels, posing health risks. The Water Quality Index (WQI) classification shows a wide range from "excellent" to "unsuitable for drinking," indicating significant spatial variability. Health Risk Assessments (HRA) identify B, Br, F, and NO3 as the primary contaminants of concern, especially in areas impacted by seawater intrusion, agricultural activities and natural geothermal fluids mixing. The use of stable isotope analysis reveals marine and freshwater interactions, which influence the water's chemical composition. This study underscores the importance of sustainable management practices to mitigate contamination risks, safeguard public health, and preserve the multifunctional role of urban wetlands in enhancing urban resilience and climate adaptation. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Enhancing pro-nature behavior across societies is a key sustainability challenge, with people's connection to nature recognized as a primary driver. Understanding how this connection varies across countries and regions and the factors influencing it is, therefore, a crucial step in addressing this challenge. However, this remains poorly understood due to the scarcity of cross-country studies, particularly outside the Global North. Using data from a survey spanning 23 countries worldwide, we identified substantial variations in individuals’ psychological (cognitive) and physical (experiential) connections to nature. These differences are influenced by several country-level factors, such as socioeconomic development and the extent of cultivated land, alongside individual-level factors like education level and social status. The broad variation in connection to nature revealed by our study provides valuable insights for predicting large-scale spatial patterns of this connection and identifying regions where targeted efforts are most needed to strengthen it effectively. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Research on living green walls highlighted the potential for urban heat reduction, increased biodiversity and social benefits. A trial of living green walls was undertaken in two challenging (both socially and environmentally) inner-city locations. Environmental data was collected plus a social survey of peoples’ responses was conducted. The survey revealed a willingness and desire to have more nature in the city. Appreciation for the beauty of nature received a slightly higher positive response than stress reduction or increasing happiness. Due to correct installation and species selection the living walls thrived. It was a collaborative project between a university and a local government with unanticipated benefits encountered throughout the project. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This paper presents two key data sets derived from the Pomar Urbano project. The first data set is a comprehensive catalog of edible fruit-bearing plant species, native or introduced to Brazil. The second data set, sourced from the iNaturalist platform, tracks the distribution and monitoring of these plants within urban landscapes across Brazil. The study includes data from the capitals of all 27 federative units of Brazil, focusing on the ten cities that contributed the most observations as of August 2023. The research emphasizes the significance of citizen science in urban biodiversity monitoring and its potential to contribute to various fields, including food and nutrition, creative industry, study of plant phenology, and machine learning applications. We expect the data sets presented in this paper to serve as resources for further studies in urban foraging, food security, cultural ecosystem services, and environmental sustainability. © 2024 GigaScience Press.

AB  - Many lower-income countries are highly vulnerable to the impacts of natural disasters and climate change, due to their geographical location and high levels of poverty. In response, they are developing climate action plans that also support their sustainable development goals, but conventional adaptation approaches such as hard flood defenses can be expensive and unsustainable. Nature-based solutions (NbS) could provide cost-effective options to address these challenges but policymakers lack evidence on their effectiveness. To address this knowledge gap, we focused on Bangladesh, which is exceptionally vulnerable to cyclones, relative sea-level rise, saline intrusion, floods, landslides, heat waves and droughts, exacerbated by environmental degradation. NbS have been implemented in Bangladesh, but there is no synthesis of the outcomes in a form accessible to policymakers. We therefore conducted a systematic review on the effectiveness of NbS for addressing climate and natural hazards, and the outcomes for other sustainable development goals. Research encompasses protection, restoration and participatory management of mangroves, terrestrial forests and wetlands, as well as conservation agriculture and agro-forestry, but there is an evidence gap for urban green infrastructure. There is robust evidence that, if well-designed, these NbS can be effective in reducing exposure to natural disasters, adapting to climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions while empowering marginalized groups, reducing poverty, supporting local economies and enhancing biodiversity. However, we found short-term trade-offs with local needs, e.g. through over-harvesting and conversion of ecosystems to aquaculture or agriculture. To maximize NbS benefits while managing trade-offs, we identified four enabling factors: support for NbS in government policies; participatory delivery involving all stakeholders; strong and transparent governance; and provision of secure finance and land tenure, in line with international guidelines. More systematic monitoring of NbS project outcomes is also needed. Bangladesh has an opportunity to lead the way in showing how high quality NbS can be deployed at landscape scale to tackle sustainable development challenges in low to middle income countries, supporting a Green Economic Recovery. Our evidence base highlights the value of protecting irreplaceable natural assets such as mangroves, terrestrial forests and wetlands, and the non-market benefits they deliver, in national planning policies.

AB  - Biodiversity provides many ecosystem services in cities that are beneficial to human well-being including adaptation to the effects of climate change and positive effects of nature on human health. Rapid urbanization however is causing an adverse impact on biodiversity and the ecosystem services they provide. Protecting and restoring urban biodiversity and ecosystem services can increase human well-being of the rapidly increasing urban population. Today, however, the international biodiversity conservation practice mainly focuses on rural areas, and not on urban conservation and restoration. Within city scale, there are several opportunities to green urban living, such as green infrastructure and urban parks and nature reserves. This paper investigates the current scientific practices for promoting and protecting ecosystem services in urban areas. Secondly, the authors review and assess the legally binding instruments on biodiversity at the international and EU level in order to see if there are sufficient existing mechanisms for protection of ecosystem services in urban areas. Thirdly, the paper elaborates on the Aichi Targets in order to explore whether or not these targets are enough to facilitate the protection and enhancement of ecosystem services in urban areas as swiftly as they are needed.

AB  - Urbanization has rapidly increased in recent decades and the negative effects on biodiversity have been widely reported. Urban green areas can contribute to improving human well-being, maintaining biodiversity, and ecosystem services (e.g. pollination). Here we examine the evolution of studies on plant-pollinator interactions in urban ecosystems worldwide, reviewing also research funding and policy actions. We documented a significant increase in the scientific production on the theme in recent years, especially in the temperate region; tropical urban ecosystems are still neglected. Plant-pollinator interactions are threatened by urbanization in complex ways, depending on the studied group (plant or pollinator [generalist or specialist]) and landscape characteristics. Several research opportunities emerge from our review. Research funding and policy actions to pollination/pollinator in urban ecosystems are still scarce and concentrated in developed countries/temperate regions. To make urban green spaces contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services, transdisciplinary approaches (ecological-social-economic-cultural) are needed.

AB  - The rapid loss of biological diversity due to human activities has increased interest in understanding the interdependencies between humans and biodiversity. The evidence base for the health and well-being effects of nature-based recreation is strong, but less is known about the role of biodiversity. This qualitative study explores the complex relationship between perceived biodiversity and well-being through the following questions: 1) how do visitors of an urban forest perceive different aspects of biodiversity, and 2) how do the different aspects of biodiversity affect their perceived well-being? These biodiversity aspects applied are species encountering, diversity and abundance, interactions between species, natural processes, sounds, colors, shapes, textures, smells, and seasonal changes. The data consists of semi-structured interviews of participants (n = 12) on two guided visits in the Lahti Health Forest, Finland. The participants paid effortlessly attention to sounds, colors, and strong natural smells, whereas processes, textures, and shapes required more focus. Perceptions were affected by intentionality, activity, mindset, ecological knowledge, quality, and familiarity with a forest. The findings indicate that the multisensory experience of biodiversity is significant for the restorative and stress reduction potential of a recreational forest. At the same time, processes, seasonal changes, and textures are meaningful regarding spiritual well-being. The findings emphasize the potential of biodiverse nature to improve well-being comprehensively. By paying attention to the perceivable attributes of biodiversity in urban areas and promoting the recreational use of biodiverse natural environments, mutual benefits could be achieved for both biodiversity protection and human well-being. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Ecosystem benefits and services assessments are widely used in the current urban ecological management strategies to enhance benefits of ecosystems to urban residents, but ecosystems are not benign entities that exist solely for human benefit. Plagues, diseases, and other ecosystem-generated health risks (EHRs) have caused huge losses of life and property. In promoting systematic and comprehensive urban development and the quality of life for residents, Risk reduction for EHRs cannot be ignored. As existing studies of EHRs mapping remain relatively few. This paper proposed a mapping method based on vegetation census data for two EHRs: human-bat contact infection risk (HBCIR) and human-pollen contact sensitization risk (HPCSR). Results showed that: (1) The bat distribution risk (SBR) and the pollen sensitizing plant distribution risk (ROSDmean) were higher in woodlands and areas around reservoirs where habitat conditions are better across the city. (2) The areas with higher HBCIR and HPCSR were mainly located in the central and western parts of Shenzhen, especially in the surrounding densely populated areas with better habitat conditions. (3) All streets differed significantly from each other in HBCIR and HPCSR distribution characteristics, three streets, Huafu, Meilin and Donghu, had higher risk values. The results can provide guidance to policymaker in their work on biodiversity conservation, health risk control, and tree species application. Additionally, the methodology adopted in this study may inspire future researches on the spatialization of other EHRs. © 2024

AB  - Rapid urbanization and climate change have intensified water-related challenges in urban areas, requiring innovative solutions for sustainable water management. This study critically examines China’s sponge city initiative, which integrates green infrastructure and ecological principles to enhance urban water resilience. The research identifies key challenges, including inadequate planning, design inconsistencies, and financial sustainability issues, which hinder the full realization of ecosystem service benefits. To address these gaps, we propose a novel ecological compensation framework that integrates the ecosystem services framework with urban planning and public payment mechanisms. Our four-step methodology leverages low impact development practices to enhance policy efficacy, aligning urban development with ecological integrity and sustainability. By transitioning from ecosystem service recognition to a publicly funded compensation model, this approach ensures the financial viability of sponge city projects, fosters broad societal participation, and supports resilient urban development. Importantly, the developed framework is adaptable, making it applicable to sponge city initiatives worldwide. It offers a flexible, evidence-based strategy for cities facing similar water management challenges, promoting ecological resilience while ensuring long-term financial sustainability. This study contributes to global urban water management discourse, providing a scalable model that supports integrated, community-backed urban planning and sets a new standard for sponge city development. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Flowers, as integral elements of urban landscapes, are critical not only for aesthetic purposes but also for fostering human-nature interactions in green spaces. However, research on flower color preferences has largely been descriptive, and there is a lack of exploration of potential mechanisms influencing flower color preferences, such as economic and social factors. This study created visual samples through precise color adjustment techniques and introduced the L*, a*, and b* parameters from the CIELAB color system to quantify the flower colors of the survey samples, conducting an online survey with 354 Chinese residents. The complex aesthetic process's driving factors were unveiled through a comprehensive analysis using a Generalized Additive Model (GAM), a piecewise Structural Equation Model (SEM), and linear regression models. The results show that the public's flower color preference is primarily related to the a* and b* parameters, which represent color dimensions in the CIELAB color space, and it is not significantly related to L* (lightness). Factors such as age, annual household income level (AI), personal income sources (PI), nature experience, and emotional state (TMD) significantly influence color preferences, with emotional state identified as the most critical factor. Lastly, linear regression models further explain the potential mechanism of the influencing factors. This study proposes a framework to assist urban planners in selecting flower colors that resonate with diverse populations, enhancing both the attractiveness of urban green spaces and their potential to promote pro-environmental behavior. By aligning flower color design with public preferences, this study contributes to sustainable urban planning practices aimed at improving human well-being and fostering deeper connections with nature.

AB  - Natural habitats and their biodiversity are usually associated with protected areas, incompatible with direct anthropogenic influence. Is there a biodiversity in urban environment, what is the role of peri-urban areas to the provision of species richness and is their potential being properly utilized? These are current issues that deserve the attention of decision-makers because the human's need of natural environment in cities is expressed more intensely than in any previous period in history. Green and blue infrastructure elements, being part of the larger system of urban ecosystems, provide an essential and proven benefits to the city dwellers, like health improvement, opportunities for nature-based daily outdoor recreation, strengthening sense of place etc. The main objective of this research is to assess this part of the landscape elements in urban and peri-urban environment, which are most supportive to the maintenance of habitats and their biodiversity. Selected Functional urban area with center city of Burgas is choosen for a case study. The urban ecosystems are assessed in GIS environment with unified indicator (based on City Biodiversity Index approach) according to 5 criteria: hemeroby index, share of protected areas, fragmentation index, presence of water and species richness. The assessment is performed on two spatial levels: within Functional urban area by Urban Atlas spatial units and within urban core – by grid cells (local climate zones). The final higher scores identify areas that provide the greatest extent the maintenance of habitats and their biodiversity. The results could support the urban planning and help to optimize the link between the natural elements within the Functional urban areas, providing ecological, economic and social benefits to the regions through the enhancement of the urban ecosystem’s functions and their services. © L.

AB  - The amelioration of air quality represents one of the most complex challenges that the European Union is facing today. Although a successful strategy to improve air quality should decisively act on pollution sources, Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) may provide a huge contribution to tackle air pollution, while delivering a wide range of Ecosystem Services and enhancing the Natural Capital. In this paper, we analyzed, in both biophysical and monetary terms, the role of the Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) in improving air quality in the Metropolitan City of Naples (Southern Italy) by implementing an accounting model of PM10 removal. Our findings indicate that about 1,148 Mg of PM10 were annually removed by the UGI, for a monetary value of 36 million euros per year. We also assessed the impact of a devastating wildfire that occurred in 2017 in the study area, which resulted in a loss of PM10 removal of about 97 Mg and led to an estimated monetary loss of 3 million euros per year. The results also showed that PM10 removal efficiency largely varies seasonally and across different functional groups of vegetation, highlighting the role of functional biodiversity in the provision of Ecosystem Services under Mediterranean climate conditions. In conclusion, we maintain that the biophysical and economic assessment of Ecosystem Services can support local managers and policymakers in charge of developing urban planning strategies aimed at ensuring sustainable development and human well-being in metropolitan cities.

AB  - Environmental policy increasingly emphasizes involvement of local users and land owners in ecosystem management, but conservation planning is still largely a bureaucratic-scientific endeavour of identifying biological values for protection. Neither biological inventories nor stakeholder analyses, that tend to focus on conflicting interests, capture human resources in the landscape or the social structures and processes underlying biological conservation values. Social-ecological inventories are therefore proposed during the preparation phase of conservation projects as a means to identify people with ecosystem knowledge that practise ecosystem management. The method presented here focuses on local steward groups acting outside official management plans. In a social-ecological inventory of a river basin of southern Sweden, local steward groups, their ecosystem management activities, motives and links to other actors involved in ecosystem management were identified through interviews, participatory observations and a review of documents and other written material. Several hundred active local stewards were organized in 10 local steward groups that managed and monitored a range of ecosystem services at different spatial scales. Contributions of local stewards included on-site ecosystem management, long-term and detailed monitoring of species and ecosystem dynamics, local ecological knowledge, public support for ecosystem management and specialized networks. Two conservation projects are used to illustrate how local steward groups came together in multi-level networks and collaborated around specific conservation issues. The projects have been linked to ecosystem management at the landscape level through a flexible municipality organization, the Ecomuseum Kristianstads Vattenrike (EKV). EKV has acted as a 'bridging organization', coordinating and connecting many of the local steward groups to organizations and institutions at other levels. The process has been guided by social capital and shared visions for the whole landscape. The study shows that ecosystem management likely relies on multi-level collaboration and social-ecological inventories may help identify actors that are fundamental in such management systems. Social-ecological inventories should be employed in any attempt to develop and implement ecosystem management. © 2007 Foundation for Environmental Conservation.

AB  - Natural-based Solutions (NbS) allow us to face socio-environmental challenges and risks through the protection, restoration and sustainable management of ecosystems, providing human well-being and increasing biodiversity. In the last decade, the Mediterranean Ecoregion of Chile (EMC, 29-37oS) has experienced a continuous drought and numerous water conflicts associated with the development of industrial activities in areas that provide ecosystem services of water supply and regulation. In this context, the use of NBS in water scarcity conflicts in the CME was evaluated as a way to support the design of public policies that incorporate this approach. For this, conflicts associated with water scarcity in the CME were collected and NBS were identified to face similar conflicts in other regions of the world. Three categories of NBS were identified: (i) watershed restoration and green infrastructure, (ii) ancestral and natural infrastructure, and (iii) integrated agricultural practices. This analysis indicates that the simultaneous use of these three strategies can contribute to the resolution of water conflicts in CME. NBS are projected as an efficient and integrating option to face the problems of water scarcity, since they are considered within national policies and designed according to the environmental conditions and social context of each sector in conflict.

AB  - In the expanding urban agriculture phenomenon in Europe, home gardens are a traditional form that have kept agriculture within cities, even becoming crucial in certain historical periods (e.g., war periods). However, horticultural practices in home gardens can also have negative consequences. The goal of this paper is to assess the eco-efficiency of home gardens as a type of urban agriculture. To do so, a case study in Padua (Italy) was evaluated following life cycle assessment and life cycle costing methods. A home garden of 30.6 m(2) and 21 crop cycles were evaluated. The functional unit of the assessment was 1 kg of harvested fresh vegetable at the consumption point, and the ReCiPe method was employed for impact assessment. Environmental assessment indicated that organic fertilization, use of tap water, mineral fertilization and pesticides were the most contributing elements of the entire life cycle. Furthermore, the relevance of garden design and crop selection was a determinant in the eco-efficiency results. The assessed home garden could satisfy the food requirements of between 1 and 2 members of the household. Crop management and design recommendations are provided to improve eco-efficiency and food security potential of home gardens.

AB  - Home gardening has a long history that started when humans became sedentary, being traditionally considered an accessible source of food and medicinal plants to treat common illnesses. With trends towards urbanization and industrialization, particularly in the post-World War II period, the importance of home gardens as important spaces for growing food and medicinal plants reduced and they began to be increasingly seen as decorative and leisure spaces. However, the growing awareness of the negative impacts of agricultural intensification and urbanization for human health, food quality, ecosystem resilience, and biodiversity conservation motivated the emergence of new approaches concerning home gardens. Societies began to question the potential of nearby green infrastructures to human wellbeing, food provisioning, and the conservation of traditional varieties, as well as providers of important services, such as ecological corridors for wild species and carbon sinks. In this context. and to foster adaptive and resilient social–ecological systems, our supported viewpoint intends to be more than an exhaustive set of perceptions, but a reflection of ideas about the important contribution of home gardens to sustainable development. We envision these humble spaces strengthening social and ecological components, by providing a set of diversified and intermingled goods and services for an increasingly urban population. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - We are at a key juncture in history where biodiversity loss is occurring daily and accelerating in the face of population growth, climate change, and rampant development. Simultaneously, we are just beginning to appreciate the wealth of human health benefits that stem from experiencing nature and biodiversity. Here we assessed the state of knowledge on relationships between human health and nature and biocliversity, and prepared a comprehensive listing of reported health effects. We found strong evidence linking biodiversity with production of ecosystem services and between nature exposure and human health, but many of these studies were limited in rigor and often only correlative. Much less information is available to link biodiversity and health. However, some robust studies indicate that exposure to microbial biodiversity can improve health, specifically in reducing certain allergic and respiratory diseases. Overall, much more research is needed on mechanisms of causation. Also needed are a re envisioning of land use planning that places human well-being at the center and a new coalition of ecologists, health and social scientists and planners to conduct research and develop policies that promote human interaction with nature and biodiversity. Improvements in these areas should enhance human health and ecosystem, community, as well as human resilience. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We report the alpha diversity of the butterflies (Lepidoptera: Papilionoidea and Hesperioidea sensu Llorente-Bousquets et al., 2006 and Warren, 2009) of the Metepec Municipality, State of México, Mexico, whose human development index has caused, in a short time, the transformation from a natural landscape to an urban landscape. The field work included 23 samplings, carried out from May 2015 to September 2016. Eighteen sampling sites were divided into 3 main zones: urban (U), urban parks (PU) and marshes (L). A total of 41 species were identified, which are the first records for the municipality of Metepec. Of these, 4 species are endemic to Mexico and 1 is classified as a special protected species by NOM-059-Semarnat-2010. Also, 2 new state records are reported. The richness of Lepidoptera of the municipality of Metepec constitutes 11.45% of the total of the species registered for the State of México. The urban zone had the highest number of species (36); followed by urban parks (17) and the marshes zone (16). Due to the accelerated urbanization of the municipality, it is essential to propose urban landscapes management strategies that protect local biodiversity. © 2019 Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.

AB  - Climate change will further induce a generalized rise in temperature, heat waves, exacerbation of heat island effect, alteration of the precipitation regime variability with higher occurrence of high precipitation and flood events, reduction of quantity and quality of freshwater resources, disruption of agricultural production, leading to food security risk, degradation of recreational and aesthetic amenities, and loss of biodiversity. On other hand, Green Infrastructure, that is, the network of natural and semi-natural spaces within and around urban spaces, brings a constructive and protecting element that may mitigate and adapt to the local level impacts of climate change, strengthening local resilience. This paper presents a comparative study of various green infrastructures' implementation based on analytics in the United States of America, United Kingdom and Portugal, and focuses on the degree of its alignment with the public policies of mitigation and adaptation to the impacts of climate change. Pursuant to the identification of successes and failures, this paper infers common strategies, goals and benchmarking on outcomes for more adequate decision implementation and sustainable spatial planning, considering the importance of green infrastructure.

AB  - Urban waterfronts form part of cities' critical intersection between the natural and man-made environment, linking the city and its inhabitants with water. In the context of high density urban environments, they are integral to the network of green and public spaces and have the potential to encompass a range of uses including residential, commercial, leisure, recreational, heritage and art offering a multitude of economic, social, environmental benefits. The cases of HafenCity Hamburg and Waterfront Toronto discussed in this paper demonstrate successful approaches to achieving social and environmental sustainability at the waterfronts, highlighting the importance of ensuring mixed uses, public access, sustainable design and construction of buildings and infrastructure including climate change adaptations. Integrated and incremental planning of waterfronts in conjunction with citywide planning alongside careful consideration for greening, urban ecology, biodiversity, and aquatic ecosystems is also critical. In an era of rapidly urbanizing and homogenized waterfront developments, distinctiveness and authenticity derived via meaningful engagement with the local context and via engaging in participatory design processes is of increasing relevance.

AB  - The integration of urban green spaces into modern city planning is seen as a promising tool to offset the drawbacks of ever-expanding cities. Urban agriculture is a common method to implement such strategies and to increase urban sustainability with a special focus on food security. Due to their location, urban farms are highly influenced by past and present anthropogenic activities which can threaten both soil health and food safety. This study includes 12 urban agriculture sites in the metropolitan area of Adelaide, Australia. It is the first of its kind to focus on soil health in urban agriculture systems with a further emphasis on mycorrhizal fungi. Descriptive information about each site, the biodiversity of the selected plots and soil samples from different depths and locations were collected and analysed for chemical and biological parameters. Seven metals, total and plant-available (Colwell) phosphorus and available nitrogen were measured in soils. A glasshouse bioassay was also conducted to determine the abundance of beneficial arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the soils and the change of root colonization after inoculation with the mycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus irregularis. Results showed a generally high biodiversity of plants that correlated with site activity (commercial or community garden) and which could potentially be used for urban biodiversity conservation. Metal concentrations in soils were below national guidelines levels for all samples, although sites with previous industrial history showed elevated levels when compared to sites without industrial history. The use of raised beds with introduced soils eliminated differences in previous land-use history, thereby providing a good option to support cleaner production. Gardening soils were considered highly fertile, with plant-available (Colwell) P concentrations exceeding recommended levels for most horticultural crops, while soils were adequately supplied with nitrogen. Most plant nutrients were derived from freely available urban waste streams and integrated via composting. Various urban waste streams could be used to counter-act imbalanced soil nutrients. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were present in all sites, indicating that the practiced soil management is sustainable from a microbial perspective. Given their important role in supporting plant nutrition, and potential to reduce the need for external nutrient inputs, they provide an important focal point for achieving clean and sustainable urban food production. The results were incorporated into a framework for the management of urban soil health. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Two-track thinking about climate change and related sustainability challenges reflects the tendency for people to express concern but, notwithstanding, continue life as usual, making no changes in lifestyles or political agendas. How to overcome this phenomenon has come to the fore as central to meeting energy, transport and other targets for limiting global warming enough to ensure human societies do not collapse. Mobilizing the right emotions, in the right socio-cultural contexts, has proven a major challenge, amidst the failure of conventional communications methods. These typically assume an information deficit: the erroneous belief that people will change if they have more facts. This study involved a practical application of current thinking about cultural trauma, using everyday walking as a vehicle for change. It contributes to current knowledge in three dimensions. It uses walking and walkability to examine the challenge of moving from knowledge to action in a highly urbanized, middle-income country, Chile, which is rapidly transitioning toward “development” but still has a long way to go. It focuses on how to connect theory with real streets, in a troubled but resilient neighborhood, Bellavista, in Metropolitan Santiago. And it innovated using a transdisciplinary, activism-based, action research methodology. Addressing crime, gender and childhood in walking-related strategies effectively encouraged more sustainable living, improving links with local food and community gardens, shared meals, and walking-cycling among older adults, families and children. Improving social solidarity and connection proved an essential first step to open up pathways with strong potential for improving sustainability.

AB  - Introduction: To explore the basis of ecotourism, we should look for the basis of literature concerning the tourism development and emersion of sustainability though it. Tourism planning has progressed over this period after the WWII, with a detonation of economic and marketing ideas coming to tourism planning. Thus, it is called "Boosterism" which we cannot consider it as a model of planning at all and model of "Mass tourism" with the belief of "the more is the better" was the best idea for its tourism development. Economic approach, with marketing techniques as its tolls is the next step in tourism development. During the 1970s, the results of tourism development proceeded, was an uneven distribution of benefits, and recognition of multitude of negative tourism's impacts became more evident, so the question of development raised up as "growth paradigm" which referred "cautionary perspective" to this school of thought which this perspective might be considered as the physical/spatial planning tradition. The summery of evolution in the Think/Idea, Model and Tools in Tourism development after WWII are mentioned in Table 1. (Table Presented) During the 80's decades there are a great discussion between the tourism planning literature and language of marketing to prolong the destination's growth stage. In late 1980, the theorizers described the model of "soft tourism" and considered it as the new development model instead of mass tourism. Also during this period "responsible tourism", "green tourism", and "appropriate tourism" introduced as new terms. The concept of sustainable tourism was bring together in the late 1980's by the tourism industry's reaction to the Brundtland report on sustainable development following the WCED in 1987. Some explains that conference report "Our Common Future" as "Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs". All above discussions and critics replaced by the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, that marked the beginning of a worldwide commitment which replaced Sustainable development (as a right in Agenda 21) must be applied in a way that respond to the social and environmental needs of current and future generation. But the problem was it is ignored on the working agenda and three pillars. In Barbados Conference it was for the first time that "sustainable tourism" and "nature based tourism" recognized as the branch of the sustainable development in final dissertation and action plans, and also ecotourism, economic growth and environmental preservation introduced as sustainable tourism development elements in all conference branches. Discussion and Results: The article, explore the discussion on ecotourism through an expansion of its meaning starts from the Hetzer states about "ecological tourism" and then other theorizers, and then explore discussion about "the concept of ecotourism" through the viewpoints of some critic. They all can be concluded as below items: • Sustainable use of biodiversity and natural resources; • Impact minimisation, both upon the natural and socio-cultural environment, especially in therms of climate change energy, energy consumption and traditional cultures; • Empowerment and fully informed participation of local stakeholders, particularly local communities and indigenous peoples; • Awarness-raising and environmental education of all stakeholders, especially travellers and hosts; • Lasting economic benefits for all actors. In comparison of the meaning and concept of ecotourism, we have one important question: why "small scale" and "the exact location-the location where action of ecotourism occurs" is not mentioned in above five elements? By literature review, it is obviously that although there is no great dissension between theorizers but there is not any common agreement on the discussion about that question too. There is a discussion about comparison of the mass tourism and soft tourism and he conclude that mass tourism ought to be useful for preserved areas, so it can be rejected the small scale. Also it can be drawn two polar of extremes for continuum of ecotourism paradigm. One pole is the view that all tourism (including ecotourism) has negative impacts on the nature. Conversely in the other pole, human are viewed as living creatures (as it called fauna) - whose behavior and activities is inevitably "natural"⋯ so therefore human behavior is "natural". As the human is part of the "natural process" and, as a result, they are literally unable and powerless to act and behave unnaturally. Therefore, no differention between ecotourism and other models of tourism in terms of their "naturalness" and thus, all ecotourism is tourism and conversely. This argument shows that there are no common agreements on the scale of ecotourism. So as it concluded in article three items can be considered as the common agreement on the concept of ecotourism: • Environmental/Biodiversity conservation and reduction of travel and development impacts; • Local economic empowerment; • Education through ecological and cultural Travel and experience. After 1990's decade correlated with the world acceptation on the definitions of ecotourism, the experimental activities tried to implement the concept of ecotourism in the urban area. This pragmatically activity starts with the activities of Green Tourism Association (GTA) in the city of Toronto in 1996. The next important step was the first international Urban Ecotourism Conference hold in in 2004, in its declaration, it respect Urban Ecotourism as an ongoing opportunity to conserve biological and social diversity, create new jobs and improve the quality of life and delivered declaration by these four goal as it deliberately defined by Planeta: • Restoring and conserving natural and cultural heritage including natural landscapes and biodiversity, and indigenous cultures; • Maximizing local benefits and engaging the local community as owners, investors, hosts and guides; • Educating visitors and residents on environmental matters, heritage resources, sustainability; • Reducing our ecological footprint. In the article it discussed ideas and implemented project according to the urban ecotourism. All those projects have this hypothesis that urban ecotourism is an applied idea so all of them try to implement their ideas by experiment them in a real urban region. According to all of them, urban ecotourism is an opportunity to conserve our urban areas and make it more sustainable. Some experimental articles is tried to define the dimension of urban ecotourism using fuzzy numbers construction. They tried to introduce an alternative approach, the fuzzy number construction approach, to construct Sustainable Urban Ecotourism Indicators System (SUEIS), which may contribute to the understanding of urban ecotourism, and to excavate the discrepancies of urban ecotourism and traditional ecotourism. The most important thing is that a relative unanimity is in the urban ecotourism theorizers article and case study. Constituents of their principles includes the concept of ecotourism which deployed expressions like these in their work. The concept of urban ecotourism consequence of the experimented and discussion can be draw in a diagram as below: (Figure Presented) Conclusion: Most of the theorizers believe that urban ecotourism is a Contradiction in term. In this regard there are some practitioners who implemented the ecotourism in an urban region. Conversely, the group believed in urban ecotourism, predicate others as "traditional ecotourism" and try to deduce theirselves. In this article by discussion on evolutionary configuring the concept of ecotourism, it tries to consequence that there is no differention between two groups. In the other hand, the urban ecotourism is not a new paradigm and according to their pragmatist approaches it depends on the three main concept which those are as same as the ecotourism. While urban ecotourism is a burgeoning subject in the research of ecotourism, more attempts are needed to interpret the contents of urban ecotourism.

AB  - Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) are growing in popularity to mitigate and adapt to climate change, enhance biodiversity, and secure human well-being. However, the emergence of NBS has not generated equal attention for all ecosystems. One such neglected ecosystem are ponds and pondscapes (i.e. groups of ponds in a landscape), which are deteriorating in quality and diminishing in quantity. As the European Union (EU) is regarded as influential in the conceptualisation and operationalisation of NBS, we conducted a qualitative content analysis of 38 EU policies to identify opportunities and limitations for the implementation of ponds and pondscapes as NBS. We focus our analysis on ponds and pondscapes, but their prevalence in different landscapes and their multitude of benefits allows us to also make some inferences about the implications of the EU policy context for NBS at large. We find that EU policies strengthen NBS linked to existing and potential Natura 2000 sites, as well as to ecosystems protected through the EU's Birds and Habitats Directives and Water Framework Directive. However, if ecosystems fall outside of these already established policies - as is the case with the vast majority of ponds and pondscapes - their implementation as NBS may be hampered. We also find that the EU emphasises natural water retention measures and carbon-rich ecosystems for climate change adaptation and mitigation, but mostly does not explicitly include ponds and pondscapes despite their potential contributions. Other findings are that the EU's Horizon Europe research policy will likely influence which ecosystems will be used and financed as NBS, while the exact ambition and selection of NBS rests with lower-level authorities or individuals. Therefore, further studies tracing the impact of the supra-national EU policy framework at lower governance levels are vital.

AB  - Urban green infrastructure has the potential to offer multiple ecosystem services to society. However, there is little information about the role of these tree dominated, public streetscapes on the local-scale provision of ecosystem services in European mid-sized cities. In the present study, we explored the local-scale effects of different tree dominated streetscape types on mitigating temperatures and air pollution in the city of Bolzano, Italy by integrating the ENVI-met and UFORE models as well as local field, pollution and climate data. We found that total estimated air pollution removal by trees in Bolzano was 2.42 metric tons per year (t/yr); with ozone (1.2 t/yr) being the pollutant most removed and carbon monoxide (0.03 t/yr) the least. Total air pollution removal (901.4 kg/yr) was greatest in parks. Total biogenic volatile organic compound emissions, an ecosystem disservice, were also estimated. The ENVI-met simulations found that urban trees can reduce streetscape temperatures by up to 2 degrees C during the summer and improve human thermal comfort. Results can be used to better understand the dynamics of local-scale ecosystem services of mid-size European cities and to better assess the role of urban streetscapes and green infrastructure in improving human well-being and mitigating the effects of climate change.

AB  - The Milpa System is an ancient agroecosystem that has played a crucial role in Mesoamerican agriculture for over 9,000 years, particularly in Mexico and Central America. This system provides essential ecosystem services, such as food production, soil quality restoration, biodiversity conservation and the transmission of ecological knowledge. The objective of this systematic review is to inventory and analyse the potential ecosystem services provided by the Milpa System and similar maize-based intercropping systems. The review followed the PRISMA methodology, ensuring rigorous and reproducible research across studies published worldwide in English and Spanish between 2017 and 2023. The analysis included 47 studies that identified a total of 38 distinct ecosystem services. Amongst these, five provisioning services were identified, with 32 articles highlighting food provision. Twenty regulation and maintenance services were discussed, with biodiversity conservation being the most prominent, mentioned in 24 articles. However, cultural services were under-represented, appearing in only 12 articles. Despite the limited research on the Milpa System’s ecosystem services, particularly outside of Mexico, the findings underscore the system’s critical role in promoting agricultural resilience, ensuring food security and conserving biodiversity. This review emphasises the need for increased research to preserve and promote the Milpa System as a sustainable agricultural model that contributes to the well-being of both local communities and broader ecosystems. © Romero-Natale A et al.

AB  - Mammals are key components of biodiversity mediating ecosystem functions, mainly because of the diversity of forms and functions of this group. Understanding and making explicit the role of mammals underpinning Nature’s Contributions to People (NCP) or directly contributing to human well-being would help to influence policy formulation towards sustainable development and nature conservation. Through a workshop held at the XXXII Jornadas Argentinas de Mastozoología and subsequent collaborative work, we compiled information related to Mammal’s Contributions to People in Argentina (MCP-Arg) based on participants’ interpretation of the available literature and their field experience. Argentinian mammals contribute to 12 of the 18 defined NCPs. We derived numerous MCP-Arg from studies that focused mainly on ecological processes and conservation, revealing an information gap in MCP-Arg description, quantification, and mapping. All taxa contribute similarly to the overall contributions, highlighting the importance of preserving mammal diversity. Conservation should also be framed at the local community rather than regional scales, aiming to preserve ecological functioning and contributions to human well-being, especially within regulation contributions. Our results show destructive feedback between threats and habitat-related contributions, with habitat degradation being the greatest threat to mammalian contributions and habitat maintenance the most threatened one. Our research indicates that a substantial amount of knowledge about MCP-Arg is available through narratives and interpretations. Considering the NCP approach to mammalian research, we can make significant contributions to both mammal conservation and human well-being. © SAREM, 2022.

AB  - In their natural state, wetland ecosystems provide an optimum natural environment for the sequestration and long-term storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. The loss of wetlands under advancing urbanization not only diminishes this capacity for storage, but increases methane and greenhouse gases as the land is disturbed. Nevertheless, there is growing scientific interest in using artificial or constructed wetlands as a way to mitigate the impact of global climate change, with most attention on their use for water management. Using a potential integrated urban wetland site in Glasgow as a case study, this paper critically examines how artificial urban wetlands can contribute to urban net zero targets in terms of their ability for carbon sequestration, and as part of sustainability initiatives more broadly. We find there are several barriers to implementing artificial urban wetlands for carbon drawdown alone, in particular regarding land ownership constraints, uncertainties in capture efficacy and capture quantitation, and eligibility for market-based crediting schemes. These issues make it currently challenging for the carbon reduction contribution of urban wetlands to be quantified and, say, certified to generate revenue to communities through market-based carbon crediting. However, if integrated within wider community-based sustainability initiatives, artificial urban wetlands can support multiple dimensions of sustainability, creating or supporting value far beyond water management and carbon sequestration objectives. Potential co-benefits range from areas such as health and wellbeing, biodiversity, education, food security, behavioural changes, and social care. Our findings show that for these co-benefits to be identified, maximised and realised, a place-based approach to urban wetland development must be adopted, engaging stakeholders from the project outset to define and facilitate collaboration towards shared outcomes for society, community, and environment. These findings will be relevant to any urban infrastructure development seeking to meet sustainability goals beyond carbon capture. Copyright © 2021 Rogerson, Horgan and Roberts.

AB  - As urban areas expand rapidly, understanding the complex interactions between human migration, climate change impacts, and biodiversity loss is crucial for effective climate policy. However, comprehensive knowledge of the simultaneous interaction of these aspects is still scarce. Thus, this paper proposes the classification of ‘Climate Emergency Coastal Cities’, with the categorization of 43 cities into four levels according to their vulnerability (extreme, very high, high, and critical). Our study contributes to evidence-based climate policy and supports efficient resource allocation and interventions for the most vulnerable coastal cities. Highly anthropogenic megacities were ranked as the most sensitive to climate emergencies (Lagos, Nigeria; Jakarta, Indonesia; Los Angeles and Houston, USA; and Hong Kong and Shenzhen, China). It is noteworthy that in countries from both the Global North and South, the entry of new populations is a critical issue, and represents a threat to urban structures and biodiversity; however, in territories with fragile economies and numerous governance challenges, the required structure is still more challenging. The study concludes that integrated urban planning policies are crucial, considering various perspectives and coordinated actions. Policies should address marginalized urban groups and include migrants, and promote human well-being, ecosystem recovery, and climate mitigation, for effective adaptation. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The nexus between human rights and the environment is a key issue for climate policymakers and Indigenous peoples around the world. We combine national spatial, social and biological datasets from Australia to describe where Indigenous carbon projects are happening, why Indigenous people are participating, and how effective these schemes might be at marrying Indigenous co-benefit, biodiversity and carbon emission mitigation goals. Our study shows that many Indigenous people engage in carbon offset schemes as part of their broader cultural responsibility for landscapes, and that they seek to grow the relationship between social and ecological benefits. It also highlights the challenges associated with designing carbon offset schemes that address the impacts of climate change and respond to Indigenous peoples' world views about what is required to sustain cultural-social-ecological systems. © 2015 .

AB  - The growing interest in urban areas as sites for climate action has led to new ways of conceiving and planning the urban. As climate actions reshape existing understandings of what cities are or ought to be, they constitute new modalities of what recent scholarship has referred to as 'climate urbanism'. This research has framed climate urbanism as a climate-inflected iteration of neoliberal urban development, geared towards the mobilization of 'green' private capital for large-scale infrastructural projects, focused on carbon metrics, and conducive to population displacement through eco-gentrification. In this intervention, we commend these efforts to deliver a critical perspective on how climate change gives rise to forms of urbanism that reproduce urban injustices without addressing the root causes of the climate crisis. However, we warn against two biases in recent scholarship, namely an emphasis on technological solutions and an overreliance on familiar contexts of climate action. The literature on climate urbanism does not yet reflect the diversity of urban responses emerging under the broad umbrella of urban climate action. Adopting a post-colonial perspective on climate urbanism, we call for a greater engagement with the heterogeneous character of climate-changed urban futures.

AB  - Nature's contributions to people (NCP) include the regulating, material, and non-material benefits of urban vegetation that improve well-being. It is increasingly important to plan cities that provide multiple types of NCP equitably to all residents of the city. However, due to historical legacies and planning policies, it is common for the most socially and economically vulnerable urban residents to suffer reduced access to the benefits of urban ecosystems. Previous studies of urban NCP have drawn attention to inequity in one or several types of NCP, but few have analysed a broad range. Here we analysed inequity in nine diverse forms of urban NCP across an index of economic and social vulnerability designed specifically to characterise vulnerability to environmental pressures. Furthermore, we used spatial analysis to map co-variance in vulnerability and a composite indicator of urban NCP, thus highlighting priority regions for future investments in green infrastructure. We applied this approach to the city of Christchurch/ O over bar tautahi in Aotearoa/ New Zealand, which provides a valuable case study due to its multicultural population and recent history of widespread damage and regeneration following the 2011 earthquake. Overall, the distribution of urban NCP is inequitable to the disadvantage of more vulnerable residents. Residents of more vulnerable neighbourhoods experienced reduced provision of carbon stock, runoff retention, air quality enhancement, shade, educational green space, public outdoor space accessibility, private green space, and bird biodiversity contributions. Conversely, more vulnerable neighbourhoods had greater provision of erosion mitigation (although negligible in magnitude). The wide range of indicators used and assessed in response to vulnerability, coupled with an assessment of the type of vegetation cover (i.e. grass, tall trees) provides greater insights into how inequities in urban NCP can be addressed in future redevelopment.

AB  - Forest ecosystem services are critical for maintaining ecological balance and supporting human well-being from different perspectives. However, rapid land use changes driven by agricultural expansion, urbanization, and industrial activities have significantly altered forest ecosystems, degrading the services they provide. We here conduct an ecosystem service assessment through biophysical and economic estimates for a multipurpose Andean water sub-basin in western Colombia. We compare a business as usual (BAU) with a forest nature-based solution (NbS) scenario focused on forest landscape restoration. The research employed participatory methods for the NbS selection and economic valuation techniques to evaluate water flow regulation, water provisioning, water purification, and food provisioning services. Results show that the NbS scenario yielded a net positive economic impact across most evaluated ecosystem services, with notable trade-offs. Specifically, the NbS scenario increased water retention by 2.9% compared to BAU. Water flow regulation demonstrated the most substantial economic benefit, increasing by EUR 11.39 million/year in the NbS scenario. On the other hand, the food provisioning service presented a reduction of EUR 3.2 million/year in the NbS scenario. These findings highlight the potential of forest-based NbS to address the Water-Energy-Food-Ecosystem (WEFE) nexus challenges. The study's outcomes provide valuable insights for policymakers and practitioners, supporting the development of Payment for Ecosystem Services schemes and integrating ecosystem service valuation into land use planning and decision-making processes.

AB  - Urban afforestation is increasingly regarded as a key strategy for fostering biodiversity to restore and enhance the ecosystem services needed to counteract the effects of climate change in built-up areas. In Italy, several experimental afforestation projects have been launched as part of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), focusing on cities or metropolitan areas such as Milan, Rome, Pistoia and Campobasso. These projects follow a multidisciplinary approach, integrating botanists, foresters, urban planners, landscape architects and remote sensing specialists. The goal is to address the challenging complexity of urban forest restoration through reforestation and afforestation actions. Key innovations include the integration of transdisciplinary methodologies (landscape analysis, landscape design, forest and plant ecology) with the application of advanced remote sensing technologies and participatory community engagement frameworks to address ecological and social challenges. Experimental plots have been set up across various urban areas, testing a range of planting schemes to maximise climate change resilience and ensure long-term ecological sustainability. Emphasis has been placed on selecting drought-tolerant and thermophilic species that are better adapted to widespread warming and local urban heat islands. 'Biodiversity strips' with perennial flowers for insects, shrubs with berries for birds and nests for wild bees and vertebrates have been set up to enhance biodiversity in new afforestation areas. Advanced monitoring tools, such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and multi-sensor drones, have been employed alongside field observations to assess forest growth, species survival, structural complexity and biodiversity enhancement over time. Historical analyses of landscape patterns and ecological connectivity over the past 200 years, along with evaluations of afforestation projects from the last 70 years, have provided critical insights into the successes and challenges of previous interventions, serving as a guide for future efforts. By focusing on ecological connectivity, the integration of afforested areas into the urban matrix, and citizen engagement, the current project aims to align urban forestry efforts with sustainable development goals. This comprehensive project framework addresses environmental restoration and the social and aesthetic impacts on local communities, contributing to the overall resilience and well-being of urban and peri-urban ecosystems.

AB  - The ecosystem services approach is based on the interdependencies between nature and human well-being. However, while the ecosystem services aspect of this approach is well-developed, the human well-being aspect remains unstructured and vaguely defined. An integrated conceptual framework was developed by adapting and linking the UK National Ecosystem Assessment-Follow On framework with human well-being domains. As well as benefits, the notion of disbenefits was incorporated to recognise the potentially detrimental effects from interacting with nature. Benefits and disbenefits occur at the social-ecological interface and are classified by the seven domains of human well-being they affect. The framework is applied to saltmarsh habitat as a case study, highlighting knowledge gaps and the potential applicability and usefulness of the framework. In saltmarsh, benefits mainly accrue at larger scales with a greater impact affecting local to global individuals, while disbenefits tend to occur at a smaller scale and impact in-situ individuals. The framework provides in-depth insight into links, trade-offs and dichotomies between benefits and disbenefits and human well-being, and improves accessibility to the complex research area of human well-being. This research can be a useful tool to guide environmental and health policy and management, as well as stakeholder engagement.

AB  - Global environmental change affects all societies and their environments at various spatial and temporal scales. The linking of natural ecosystems to social ones is of central importance for the analysis, mitigation of and adaptation to any action or issue related to sustainability and global change. When examining the human dimensions of environmental change, the study of ecosystem services illustrates the strong interlinkages existing between both socio-ecological systems and global change. Ecosystem services are inextricably linked to human well-being and play a central role in sustainable adaptation strategies. Environmental impact of global change can both add to social vulnerability and change resilience by altering the supply of ecosystem services and the trade-offs which can occur. It is when examining such phenomena that the importance and abilities of governance systems to shape change and responses are seen.

AB  - The ecosystem services concept evolved over the last 30 years from a general heuristic model highlighting importance of nature for human well-being to a framework for studying how the appropriation of specific ecological structures or processes influences that well-being. As the ecosystem service concept increasingly becomes an operational tool there is a need to account for the complexity of the relations between production and appropriation of ecosystem services. To date there has been a considerable focus on the spatial patterns of ecosystem services provision and appropriation. We propose a new way of categorizing them according to their temporal dynamics. We differentiate between linear and non-linear dynamics in both the provision and appropriation of ecosystem services. Based on our classification we suggest how temporal dynamics can be better integrated into ecosystem services research in four steps. These include setting the appropriate temporal boundaries of the system, identifying key types of dynamics of the ecosystem, assessing the spatial scale on which the dynamics play out in the system and developing measures for assessing these dynamics. Considering temporal dynamics of ecosystem services by following these steps has the potential to enable better planning of ecosystem services management and therefore, to enhance human well-being.

AB  - Biodiversity is essential for human well-being, but little is known about urban dwellers’ preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for urban biodiversity. Since a large share of the global population concentrates in cities, urban areas are a critical space where humans and nature interact and biodiversity-related preferences are formed. This study investigates urban dwellers’ WTP for biodiversity using a revealed-preference approach on a real estate dataset of approximately 140,000 unique entries of rental and sales transactions of apartments. Three biodiversity indicators were used to investigate heterogeneous preferences for biodiversity as an environmental good. The findings indicate that WTP for biodiversity is positive and economically significant. This implies that urban biodiversity conservation and enhancement can result in co-benefits for the local urban population. Moreover, this study identifies a satellite-based biodiversity indicator as a potential alternative to conventional species richness indicators. This finding is significant for benefit transfer studies and primary biodiversity valuation in regions with limited data availability. The results can inform biodiversity conservation and management decisions by highlighting the importance of incorporating urban biodiversity in biodiversity policies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Since a large share of the global population concentrates in cities, urban areas are a critical space where humans and nature interact and biodiversity-related preferences are formed. This study investigates urban dwellers' WTP for biodiversity using a revealed-preference approach on a real estate dataset of approximately 140,000 unique entries of rental and sales transactions of apartments. Three biodiversity indicators were used to investigate heterogeneous preferences for biodiversity as an environmental good. The findings indicate that WTP for biodiversity is positive and economically significant. This implies that urban biodiversity conservation and enhancement can result in co-benefits for the local urban population. Moreover, this study identifies a satellite-based biodiversity indicator as a potential alternative to conventional species richness indicators. This finding is significant for benefit transfer studies and primary biodiversity valuation in regions with limited data availability. The results can inform biodiversity conservation and management decisions by highlighting the importance of incorporating urban biodiversity in biodiversity policies.

AB  - Background: Cities are an important driving force to implement the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the New Urban Agenda. The SDGs provide an operational framework to consider urbanization globally, while providing local mechanisms for action and careful attention to closing the gaps in the distribution of health gains. While health and well-being are explicitly addressed in SDG 3, health is also present as a pre condition of SDG 11, that aims at inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable cities. Health in All Policies (HiAP) is an approach to public policy across sectors that systematically takes into account the health implications of decisions, seeks synergies, and avoids harmful health impacts in order to improve population health and health equity. HiAP is key for local decision-making processes in the context of urban policies to promote public health interventions aimed at achieving SDG targets. HiAPs relies heavily on the use of scientific evidence and evaluation tools, such as health impact assessments (HIAs). HIAs may include city-level quantitative burden of disease, health economic assessments, and citizen and other stakeholders' involvement to inform the integration of health recommendations in urban policies. The Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal)'s Urban Planning, Environment and Health Initiative provides an example of a successful model of translating scientific evidence into policy and practice with regards to sustainable and healthy urban development. The experiences collected through ISGlobal's participation implementing HIAs in several cities worldwide as a way to promote HiAP are the basis for this analysis. Aim: The aim of this article is threefold: To understand the links between social determinants of health, environmental exposures, behaviour, health outcomes and urban policies within the SDGs, following a HiAP rationale;to review and analyze the key elements of a HiAP approach as an accelerator of the SDGs in the context of urban and transport planning; A nd to describe lessons learnt from practical implementation of HIAs in cities across Europe, Africa and Latin-America. Methods: We create a comprehensive, urban health related SDGs conceptual framework, by linking already described urban health dimensions to existing SDGs, targets and indicators. We discuss, taking into account the necessary conditions and steps to conduct HiAP, the main barriers and opportunities within the SDGs framework. We conclude by reviewing HIAs in a number of cities worldwide (based on the experiences collected by co-authors of this publication), including city-level quantitative burden of disease and health economic assessments, as practical tools to inform the integration of health recommendations in urban policies. Results: A conceptual framework linking SDGs and urban and transportplanning, environmental exposures, behaviour and health outcomes, following a HiAP rationale, is designed. We found at least 38 SDG targets relevant to urban health, corresponding to 15 SDGs, while 4 important aspects contained in our proposed framework were not present in the SDGs (physical activity, noise, quality of life or social capital). Thus, a more comprehensive HiAP vision within the SDGs could be beneficial. Our analysis confirmed that the SDGs framework provides an opportunity to formulate and implement policies with a HiAP approach. Three important aspects are highlighted: 1) the importance of the intersectoral work and health equity as a cross-cutting issue in sustainable development endeavors;2) policy coherence, health governance, and stakeholders' participation as key issues; A nd 3) the need for high quality data. HIAs are a practical tool to implement HiAP. Opportunities and barriers related to the political, legal and health governance context, the capacity to inform policies in other sectors, the involvement of different stakeholders, and the availability of quality data are discussed based on our experience. Quantitative assessments can provide powerful data such as: Estimates of annual preventable morbidity and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) under compliance with international exposure recommendations for physical activity, exposure to air pollution, noise, heat, and access to green spaces;the associated economic impacts in health care costs per year; A nd the number of preventable premature deaths when improvements in urban and transport planning are implemented. This information has been used to support the design of policies that promote cycling, walking, public, zero and low-emitting modes of transport, and the provision of urban greening or healthy public open spaces in Barcelona (e.g. Urban Mobility, Green Infrastructure and Biodiversity Plans, or the Superblocks's model), the Bus Rapid Transit and Open Streets initiatives in several Latin American cities or targeted SDGs assessments in Morocco. Conclusions: By applying tools such as HIA, HiAP can be implemented to inform and improve transport and urban planning to achieve the 2030 SDG Agenda. Such a framework could be potentially used in cities worldwide, including those of less developed regions or countries. Data availability, taking into account equity issues, strenghtening the communication between experts, decision makers and citizens, and the involvement of all major stakeholders are crucial elements for the HiAP approach to translate knowledge into SDG implementation. ©2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: As ecological disasters loom, forests play a crucial role in mitigating climate change and aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This study aims to systematically examine the contribution of forestry science research to the SDGs through a multidisciplinary perspective, highlighting its role in advancing global sustainability efforts. Methods: Utilizing the PRISMA protocol, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of 39,841 publications since 2015, focusing on the intersection of forestry sciences with the SDGs. Network and keyword co-occurrence analyses were performed to identify thematic clusters and interdisciplinary linkages among SDGs. Results: Our findings indicate a significant focus on SDG 15 (Life on Land) and SDG 13 (Climate Action), emphasizing the forestry sector’s contributions to biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation, and ecosystem services. The analyses revealed thematic clusters centered around ecological sustainability, sustainable energy, and social development, demonstrating the diverse ways in which forestry research supports the SDGs. Discussion: This study highlights the interdisciplinary nature of forestry sciences and identifies key areas of contribution while pointing to potential research gaps. Future research should explore advanced technologies such as AI-driven analytics and remote sensing, socioeconomic impacts of forest-based livelihoods, and innovative reforestation techniques. Strengthening urban forestry, enhancing interdisciplinary cooperation, and improving governance are recommended to ensure continued contributions of forestry sciences to global sustainability and the SDGs.

AB  - Earth is a finite system with a limited supply of resources. As the human population grows, so does the appropriation of Earth's natural capital, thereby exacerbating environmental concerns such as biodiversity loss, increased pollution, deforestation and global warming. Such concerns will negatively impact human health although it is widely believed that improving socio-economic circumstances will help to ameliorate environmental impacts and improve health outcomes. However, this belief does not explicitly acknowledge the fact that improvements in socio-economic position are reliant on increased inputs from nature. Gains in population health, particularly through economic means, are disconnected from the appropriation of nature to create wealth so that health gains become unsustainable. The current study investigated the sustainability of human population health in Canada with regard to resource consumption or "ecological footprints" (i.e., the resources required to sustain a given population). Ecological footprints of the 20 largest Canadian cities, along with several important determinants of health such as income and education, were statistically compared with corresponding indicators of human population health outcomes. A significant positive relationship was found between ecological footprints and life expectancy, as well as a significant negative relationship between ecological footprints and the prevalence of high blood pressure. Results suggest that increased appropriation of nature is linked to improved health outcomes. To prevent environmental degradation from excessive appropriation of natural resources will require the development of health promotion strategies that are de-coupled from ever-increasing and unsustainable resource use. Efforts to promote population health should focus on health benefits achieved from a lifestyle based on significantly reduced consumption of natural resources. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Nature-based solution (Nbs) is an empirical approach in disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation and mitigation. Coastal ecosystem–based Nbs is more proactive in reducing the risk of coastal hazards and thus assist communities in adapting to or mitigating climate change. This chapter aims to explore the role of coastal natural features as Nbs on increasing resilient food security for coastal climate–vulnerable people through providing food diversity. It also envisions to explore the role of coastal natural ecosystems such as coastal dunes, salt marshes, seagrass beds, how lagoons serve as natural buffers against cyclones, storm surges, sea waves, tidal surges, tidal floods, and protect the shoreline from coastal erosion and sea level rise. This chapter will also illustrate the performance of these ecosystems-based services, sand dunes, and other coastal ecosystem features on climate change adaptation and mitigation services through carbon storage and sequestration, groundwater storage, and land protection. The study was conducted in Kolapara of Patukhali district which is adjacent to Bay of Bengal and known as Kuakata beach. The study was conducted using RS and GIS, participatory research including household survey, focus group discussion, key informants interview, historical disaster loss analysis, and incorporating secondary information from different sources including scientific articles. The study illustrates that coastal natural features are most important Nbs to reduce hydrometeorlogical disaster and climate change adaptation and mitigating. But due to lack of consciousness, overexploitation, and lack of integrated coastal management approaches, most of these important ecosystem features are going to be lost or diminished. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

AB  - Green roofs, as part of urban green structures, have been pointed out as the solution to pursuit the goal of healthy cities. This study aims to investigate the direct, focused on meteorological changes, and indirect, related to both meteorological and emissions changes, impacts of green roofs on air quality (PM10, NO2 and O3). For that, the numerical modelling system composed by the WRF-SLUCM-CHIMERE models was applied to a 1-year period (2017), having as case study the Porto urban area. The EnergyPlus model was also applied to estimate the green roofs impacts on the building's energy needs and related impacts on air quality and atmospheric emissions. The analysis of the direct impacts showed that green roofs promote a temperature increase during the autumn and winter seasons and a temperature decrease during the spring and summer seasons. Both negative - concentrations increase - and positive - concentrations decrease - impacts were obtained for the primary, PM10 and NO2, and secondary, O3, air pollutants, respectively, due to changes in the dynamical structure of the urban boundary layer. The indirect effects of green roofs showed their potential to enhance the buildings energy efficiency, reducing the cooling and heating needs. These changes in energy consumption promoted an overall decrease of the environmental and economic indicators. Regarding air quality, the impact was negligible. The obtained results highlight the need for a multipurpose evaluation of the impacts of green roofs, with the different effects having to be traded off against each other to better support the decision-making process. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Shenzhen is a city that is highly representative of China's rapid urbanization process. As the city rapidly expands, there are enormous challenges to the sustainable use of land resources. This paper introduces the evolution of urban land expansion and the sustainable land use policy of the Shenzhen Government since 2005. The policy covers the reduction in rural-to-urban land conversion, the delineation of urban growth boundaries, arable land reclamation and the establishment of farmland protection areas, urban redevelopment, and the investigation and prosecution of illegal construction. This paper considers the aspects of urbanization and land management systems that are unique to China. The current top-down indicative and mandatory mode of control, which relies on the central government, has very limited effects. Good results were achieved in Shenzhen for the following elements: governmental self-restraint, governmental identity change, and policy innovation. Shenzhen's sustainable land use practices can provide a reference for other cities in China.

AB  - Urban agriculture (UA) has been acknowledged for several positive effects such as access to fresh food, human activities moderation, agro-biodiversity and social and cultural relationships. In the city of Rome due to social and economic trends this kind of activity is spreading, but so far very few attempts have been addressed to inventorying the UA areas (e.g., community gardens, residential gardens, school gardens, illegal vegetable gardens, urban farms, etc.). Some mapping experiences have been carried out but all lack of a well-established methodology to be applied for a complete inventory. In this paper we propose a conceptual framework and methodology for mapping the UA in Rome through Earth Observation techniques by using the concepts of photointerpretation and the features of the most used web-mapping services. Google Earth has been used as a basic tool for visual interpretation and polygon digitalization, while other services have been used for the availability of additional features (e.g., the oblique view of Microsoft Bing Maps). The integration of the web-mapping services combined with ancillary data improved the UA site detection, allowing to define both the land use and the UA typologies. We argue that the integration of the web-mapping services for building urban agricultural land use datasets is cost-effective compared to processing commercial remote sensing images. The inventory can enable administrators to perform analysis about the interactions between agricultural activities and the urban environment, and to enact informed policies for green and vacant urban spaces management.

AB  - The issues surrounding successful public engagement with climate change mitigation policy and decision-making have been extensively researched and identified as barriers to long-term civic and civil engagement. The challenge of transforming our urban spaces to mitigate and adapt to climate change was a key theme of the Bristol Urban ID project, which explored the “business as usual” approaches in policy, practice and engagement that limit truly transformational actions. As part of the project, a Carbon Neutral Bristol 2050 roundtable was held with civic leaders and stakeholders. Discussions focussed on defining carbon neutrality targets, “scopes” and boundaries for Bristol, exploring the opportunity for Bristol to be a carbon neutral city leader, how to build political, business and citizen space for engagement with carbon neutrality, and the role of Bristol Green Capital Partnership (BGCP), a cross-sector network of over 800 organisation working for a sustainable city, as an enabler and facilitator of change. The findings demonstrate a need for organisations working on interconnected environmental, social and wellbeing, and economic issues in cities, such as carbon neutrality and air pollution, to communicate and collaborate. Partnership working is essential to improving city-wide engagement in carbon and air quality management decision making, and to developing integrated city sustainability management strategies that recognise co-benefits and trade-offs. A set of guidelines highlight the need to create political space for people and organisations to talk about carbon and air pollution to develop city plans. © 2018 WIT Press.

AB  - The steady expansion of cities has had innumerable consequences on the quality of human life. While encroaching economic demands makes preserving green space in most city centers difficult, open space is plentifully a few stories higher. As a result, the idea of the green roof is gaining proponents. Green roof systems are living vegetation installed on the roofs. These can provide many environmental and social benefits and can be an invaluable retreat for achieving low carbon high performance building. Establishing garden roofs or vegetated roofs can improve stormwater management, conserve energy, mitigate urban heat island effect, improve return on investment compared to traditional roofs, reduce noise and air pollution, increase urban biodiversity and provide a more aesthetically pleasing environment. This paper focuses on the review of the current knowledge regarding the benefits of extensive green roofs and the potentials of this technology to be implemented in the Indian context.

AB  - Representing 9% of the land worldwide, the coastal zone is a highly populated part of the land, where economic and social growth continuously arise. An expected consequence of rapid development on the coastal zone is the creation of significant environmental pressures connected to human activities. Within this framework, the need to use the ecosystem services concept under the prism of sustainable development has risen to increase the provision of services to the people through an ecosystem approach using the human-environment interaction. The aim of this paper is to form an integrated approach for sustainable blue economy in a coastal ecosystem, using the SDGs and the ecosystem services frameworks and exploring the interlinkages of the ecosystem's parameters from both sides. The outcome of this study is the formation of a decision-making tool for sustainable blue economy in a coastal ecosystem, which classifies the SDGs with a specific factor, according to their importance for the sustainable blue economy, and helps stakeholders prioritize their actions toward the achievement of sustainability in the specific ecosystem.

AB  - The severity and frequency of short-duration, but damaging, urban area floods have increased in recent years across the world. Alteration to the urban micro-climate due to global climate change impacts may also exacerbate the situation in future. Sustainable urban stormwater management using low impact development (LID) techniques, along with conventional urban stormwater management systems, can be implemented to mitigate climate-change-induced flood impacts. In this study, the effectiveness of LIDs in the mitigation of urban flood are analyzed to identify their limitations. Further research on the success of these techniques in urban flood mitigation planning is also recommended. The results revealed that LIDs can be an efficient method for mitigating urban flood impacts. Most of the LID methods developed so far, however, are found to be effective only for small flood peaks. They also often fail due to non-optimization of the site-specific and time-varying climatic conditions. Major challenges include identification of the best LID practices for the region of interest, efficiency improvements in technical areas, and site-specific optimization of LID parameters. Improvements in these areas will allow better mitigation of climate-change-induced urban floods in a cost-effective manner and will also assist in the achievement of sustainable development goals for cities.

AB  - Humans have lived from equator to poles for millennia but are now increasingly intruding into the wild spaces of other species and steadily extruding ourselves from our own wild spaces, with a profound impact on: our relationship with the natural world; survival of other species; pollution; climate change; etc. We have yet to grasp how these changes directly impact our own health. The primary focus of this paper is on the beneficial influence of proximity to the natural environment. We summarize the evidence for associations between exposure to green space and blue space and improvements in health. In contrast, grey space – the urban landscape – largely presents hazards as well as reducing exposure to green and blue space and isolating us from the natural environment. We discuss various hypotheses that might explain why green, blue, and grey space affect health and focus particularly on the importance of the biodiversity hypothesis and the role of microbiota. We discuss possible mechanisms and exposure routes – air, soil, and water. We highlight the problem of exposure assessment, noting that many of our current tools are not fit for the purpose of understanding exposure to green and blue space, aerosols, soils, and water. We briefly discuss possible differences between indigenous perspectives on the nature of our relationship with the environment and the more dominant international-science view. Finally, we present research gaps and discuss future directions, particularly focusing on the ways in which we might – even in the absence of a full understanding of the mechanisms by which blue, green, and grey space affect our health – begin to implement policies to restore some balance to our environment of with the aim of reducing the large global burden of ill health. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Pollinator diversity and abundance are under direct threat from human activities. Despite societal dependence on pollinators for crop production, humankind continues to drive pollinator declines through agricultural intensification and urbanisation. Urban environments can provide refuge to some pollinators. There is a need, however, to understand how pollinator communities can be supported in these areas while also considering human needs. Public green spaces provide a promising avenue to target plant–pollinator conservation measures in an urban setting due to their large area, high abundance and low plant–pollinator biodiversity. We used a paired design to compare the plant community, pollinator community and plant–pollinator interactions of (i) public urban green spaces enhanced with wildflower meadows and pollinator-friendly ornamental plantings to (ii) control unenhanced urban green spaces. The planting types within enhanced sites were also separately compared. Our results show that not only was the diversity of the overall pollinator community higher in enhanced than control sites, but also the complexity of some wild Hymenoptera and the abundance of Diptera pollinator groups. The negative impact of urbanisation on some pollinator groups was reduced in enhanced sites compared with control sites. Planting both pollinator-friendly ornamental plants and wildflower meadows significantly increased the visits from Diptera and the diversity in the plant–pollinator community compared with wildflower plantings alone. Our results suggest that enhancing public spaces for pollinators has positive effects on key groups and can help mitigate the impacts of urbanisation. Non-native ornamental plants can also play a role in enhancing green spaces for pollinators while maintaining their recreational functions. This supports a mixed-planting approach for improving public green spaces in urban areas for both people and nature. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - A loss of natural capital within cities and their surrounding areas has been noticed over the last decades. Increasing development associated with higher sealing rates has caused a general loss of Urban Green Spaces (UGS) within the urban environment, whereas urban sprawl and the improvement of road networks have deeply fragmented the surrounding landscape and jeopardized ecosystems connectivity. UGS are an essential component of the urban system, and their loss has a greater impact on, e.g., ecological and hydrological processes, threatening human well-being. Different types and spatial configurations of UGS may affect their own ability to provide ecosystem services, such as biodiversity support and water regulation. Nevertheless, the study of UGS spatial patterns is a research branch poorly addressed. Moreover, UGS analyses are mainly focused on public and vast green spaces, but seldom on informal, private, and interstitial ones, returning a myopic representation of urban green areas. Therefore, this study investigates the UGS spatial patterns within six Southern European cities, using the urban morphology analysis to assess all urban vegetated lands. Results revealed three main Urban Green Spatial Patterns (UGSPs): Fragmented, Compact, and Linear Distributions. UGSPs taxonomy represents a novelty in the urban morphology field and may have important implications for the ability to provide ecosystem services and, thus, human well-being.

AB  - In the management of resources, the cost of opportunity plays an important role decision making when resources are finite and their use restricted. In natural protected areas restrictions can lead to social issues when the local economy suffers: the displacement of people, unsupportive attitude towards conservation or illegal activities. This situation is important in biosphere reserves, which should be learning laboratories for an integrated economic, societal, cultural and environmental sustainability. This paper analyzes the example of Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve in Romania, aiming to find correlations between social and environmental issues. The results indicate that urbanization, deforestations and abandonment of agriculture are the leading transitional dynamics of environmental degradation, and ageing and migration of population (especially from rural areas) to better job opportunities are the main societal challenges; they seem to be inversely correlated, although not statistically significant. Rural communities, with a better environmental status, experience social issues, and urban areas, with a better socio-demographic status, face environmental impacts. Spatial analyses show that isolation, essential condition for safeguarding the pristine environmental status, is a major obstacle for development. The solution consists of needs-based policies aimed at preserving traditional values and increasing environmental awareness through education.

AB  - Biodiversity conservation confers social benefits at many levels. Although the gene pool is a global public good, many of the ecosystem services supported by biodiversity are regional or even local public goods. At all levels, biodiversity underpins the capacity of the system to deliver services over a range of environmental conditions. The economic problem addressed in this chapter is how to correct for (a) the failure of markets to signal the true cost of biodiversity change in terms of ecosystem services, (b) the failure of governance systems to regulate access to the biodiversity embedded in 'common pool' environmental assets, and (c) the failure of communities to invest in biodiversity conservation as an ecological 'public good'. The chapter reviews both the nature of the challenges posed by these failures, and the options for addressing them. It requires that we are able to correctly identify both the private and social decision problems, and hence that we are able to value those non-marketed environmental effects that are ignored in many private decisions. It further requires that we are able to identify governance mechanisms, institutions, and instruments that will induce private decision-makers to behave in ways that are consistent with the social interest. This chapter focuses on the institutional and policy options for securing the socially optimal mix of species, given the role of biodiversity in assuring ecosystem services over a range of environmental conditions. © Oxford University Press 2009.

AB  - The planning and management of biodiversity conservation are constant challenges, and the assessment of sustainability is a relevant tool for these processes. This study aims to analyze sustainability in the municipalities that integrate the biomes of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, which are the Atlantic Forest biome and the Pampa biome, through the application of a Sustainability Barometer model. The proposed model was applied in two time periods, in the year 2000 and in the year 2016, using land use and land cover, pollution, socioeconomic and human health indicators, which have an impact on sustainable development. Spatial distribution and analysis of the degree of sustainability was used, through the Global Moran Index, to determine whether there is a significant spatial correlation with the existence of clusters. The results indicate that the two biomes were considered to have an intermediate degree of sustainability, in the two periods analyzed, and there was no considerable evolution in the degree of sustainability in 16 years. The environmental well-being index was categorized as an intermediary, and the human well-being index was considered higher, with a potentially sustainable degree, in the Atlantic Forest biome. It was possible to measure the degree of sustainability of each variable, in order to understand which ones exert the most negative pressure on sustainable development, as well as which municipalities have the lowest performance. In the Pampa biome, there was a decrease of 14.1% of the municipalities with a potentially sustainable degree to the intermediate degree of sustainability, between periods. The spatial distribution of the degree of sustainability indicates a trend of clusters and a positive and significant correlation (p = 0.001), in biomes, both in 2000 and in 2016, indicating that the classification of sustainability is not random.

AB  - Rapid global urbanization has perturbed ecosystem structures and functions, resulting in ecological risk and threatening sustainable human well-being and socioeconomic development. However, scientific indicators to analyze ecosystem service (ES) risk patterns need to be explored in detail. In addition, studies on ES supply risk are stagnating on historical or status explorations, especially from the view of disturbance from land-use changes. This study seeks to develop a framework for modeling past-future ES supply risk pattern evaluation and probing into ES risk patterns under different future land-use scenarios. To achieve this objective, the framework integrates the Future Land Use Simulation (FLUS) model, the Intelligent Urban Ecosystem Management System (IUEMS) model, and an established indicator system incorporating ES supply trend, hotspots and coldspots, and ES trade-offs, and synergies. The results show that: (1) In 2050, the supply of climate regulation in the Xi'an Metropolitan Area (XMA) will increase, while that of carbon sequestration and recreation will decrease. In 2050, the supply of climate regulation is the highest under ecological protection (EP) scenario, while the supply of carbon sequestration and recreation are the highest under cropland protection (CP) scenario. (2) From 2000 to 2050, the hotspots and coldspots of climate regulation increase in both natural development (ND) scenario and CP scenario. Notably, CP scenario experiences the most significant reduction in extremely significant hotspots and coldspots of carbon sequestration. From 2000 to 2050, at the regional and pixel scales, climate regulation and carbon sequestration mainly show trade-offs, and carbon sequestration and recreation show synergies. (3) ES supply risk in XMA is high in the center and low in the north and south. The ES supply risk from 2000 to 2050 is increasing, with expanding "extremely high risk", "high risk", and "extremely safe" areas. ES supply risk management should adhere to more strict land-use policies and guidelines, management zoning for areas with different levels of ES risk, and an accurate understanding of ES trade-offs and synergies for scientific risk management. This study could provide theoretical and technical references for ES risk assessment research and promote scientific ecological risk management.

AB  - The NHS is the most revered organisation in Britain: 'the proudest achievement of our modern society'.1 It is certainly the largest, although since its inception in 1948 it has operated in a government-funded environment of restricted resources. Nevertheless, it has also benefitted from a generally effective model of intervention centred on a hospital care system integrating specialist and emergency care and a primary care system which functions as both a source of treatment and a gatekeeper to specialist care. New circumstances, including environmentally-generated risk and a shifting disease reality, challenges the adequacy of this model. This paper argues that these new circumstances, some of which have seen a legislative response by government, mean that the NHS has to apply sustainable development thinking programmatically throughout its management and operations. It is also argued that the organisation needs to refocus towards prevention particularly in order to stem the rising tide of non-communicable disease. This paper sets out the thinking and actions of the Sustainable Development Unit, which has the task of developing and implanting sustainability concepts in the NHS. It is argued that the cause of sustainable development calls for a mix of cultural and technological shifts, new incentives and a rolling programme of innovative change. Some examples of success are presented. © 2015 The Royal Society for Public Health.

AB  - This study investigates the potential of biochar production from urban pruning waste as a sustainable solution within a circular economy framework. Urban green waste, often underutilized, typically increases landfill burden and greenhouse gas emissions. Converting pruning waste into biochar reduces landfill reliance while enabling stable carbon sequestration. Utilizing the circular triple-layered business model canvas (CTLBMC), biochar’s impact is evaluated across economic, environmental, and social dimensions. This structured analysis is based on a theoretical framework and uses secondary data to illustrate the model’s applicability. As a result of the conducted studies, it was found that biochar derived from urban green waste not only improves soil phytotoxicity and enables long-term carbon sequestration, but also offers economic benefits, including municipal cost savings in waste management and diversified revenue streams from biochar sales. Socially, biochar production promotes community engagement in sustainable practices and supports urban greening initiatives, enhancing local ecosystems. The findings suggest that biochar production, assessed through the CTLBMC framework, represents a viable circular business model. This approach provides significant environmental, economic, and social benefits over conventional disposal, offering valuable insights for policymakers, waste management professionals, and urban planners advancing circular economy solutions. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Reductions in global bee populations are threatening the pollination benefits to both the planet and people. Whilst the contribution of bee pollination in promoting sustainable development goals through food security and biodiversity is widely acknowledged, a range of other benefits provided by bees has yet to be fully recognised. We explore the contributions of bees towards achieving the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our insights suggest that bees potentially contribute towards 15 of the 17 SDGs and a minimum of 30 SDG targets. We identify common themes in which bees play an essential role, and suggest that improved understanding of bee contributions to sustainable development is crucial for ensuring viable bee systems.

AB  - Urbanization has impacted biodiversity and ecosystems at a global scale. At the same time, it has been recognized as a driver of the physical and emotional gap between humans and nature. The lack of direct contact with nature can have a negative impact on several aspects of human well-being and change knowledge and attitudes of people towards the environment. However, this phenomenon is still poorly understood in megacities outside developed countries. Here, we explore the relationship between ecological knowledge and self-reported well-being in an important urban park in Santiago, Chile. We conducted semi-structured surveys of park users to explore their beliefs, preferences, ecological knowledge of plants and birds, and self-reported well-being. Citizens associated urban parks mainly with "nature," and particularly with the presence of trees and plants. Trees were recognized as the most relevant elements of urban parks; in turn, birds were ranked as the less relevant. Regarding formal ecological knowledge, respondents correctly identified an average of 2.01 plants and 2.44 birds out of a total of 10 for each taxon, and exotic species were more likely to be recognized. Park users also reported high scores for self-reported well-being. Interestingly, variance of self-reported well-being scores tended to increase at low levels of ecological knowledge of trees, but no significant relationship was detected with knowledge of birds, nor native species. Ecological knowledge of trees was positively related to self-reported well-being. Results suggest that parks can positively contribute to bring people closer to nature in middle-income countries. Improving ecological knowledge can be critical to restore the relationship between humans and nature in megacities.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between urban compactness and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the road transport sector in South Korea, focusing on 84 cities, particularly 27 metropolitan areas with populations of approximately 500,000. We developed an urban compactness index (UCI) using Moran's I, entropy, and the Gini coefficient, integrating city size into the analysis. Cities were categorized into five groups based on their size to analyze GHG emissions and regional variations in compactness comparatively. Our results revealed a significant inverse relationship between UCI and per capita road transport GHG emissions, which was more pronounced in larger cities. Specifically, cities with a population over 1 million displayed reduced per capita road transport GHG emissions in compact urban structures. In conclusion, these findings suggest that larger cities can effectively reduce per capita road transport GHG emissions through urban planning for compact development. Additionally, planners need to consider city size when analyzing the UCI and formulating urban planning strategies aimed at achieving carbon neutrality.

AB  - Maintaining household welfare in the transition to a net zero economy is critical to the public acceptance of climate policy. A challenge in meeting this goal is our incomplete understanding of the distribution of household-level benefits from policies designed to reduce greenhouse gases in residential buildings. We provide new insights on key variables that contribute to household and social welfare by quantifying both the level and distribution of energy savings, bill savings, and rebates disbursed from Canada's national energy efficiency retrofit program. Using a unique dataset consisting of electricity and natural gas consumption from all singlefamily houses in a Canadian city, we find that adopted retrofits reduce natural gas consumption for up to 10 years in the average participating house by about 20%. Whole-envelope retrofits reduce natural gas consumption by 35%. However, these savings represent only about half of pre-retrofit predicted savings, and several recommended retrofits save zero energy. While energy bill savings exhibit a modest peak among some lower wealth properties, retrofit rebates were disbursed equally across the house wealth distribution.

AB  - House plants are reported to ‘clean’ formaldehyde from indoor environments and thus reduce its deleterious health effects. We measured formaldehyde removal rates at concentrations similar to those caused by new furniture or office photocopiers. We also measured CO2 and humidity changes, counted the stomata density and monitored leaf color and shape changes. Controls were an artificial polyester “fern” and methanol as the VOC. All plants reduced formaldehyde from 0.75 ppm to below 0.2 ppm in six hours. The plants fall into two major groups with different responses: one group showed high removal rates: Boston fern (0.85 m h−1), golden pothos (0.41 m h−1), Spanish moss (0.44 m h−1) and spider plant (0.40 m h−1) - faster than the artificial fern (0.09 m h−1). They also show no change in color and appear to completely assimilate formaldehyde. Another group absorbed formaldehyde at a significantly lower rate (dumb cane: 0.07 m h−1; aloe vera: 0.17 m h−1; and Chinese evergreen: 0.09 m h−1) and had a generally different overall behavior from the ‘fast’ group - different CO2, humidity and variance changes - suggesting a different formaldehyde absorption mechanism. An ‘intermediate case’, snake plant (0.29 m h−1), has a slower rate than the fast group but also exhibited other changes, suggesting some combination of both mechanisms. Overall good correlations between formaldehyde uptake rates and stomata counts, total leaf area and water evapotranspiration rates were shown by all these plants. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background Several pressing issues face municipal planners including increased land use and climate change. Managing these issues requires a balance between different actions to accommodate citizen’s demands of ecosystem services (ES) and development projects. The implementation of ES as a new tool for assessments needs to be contrasted by research considering existing tools such as Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). ES has been introduced as a policy tool at the governmental level but implementation at the local and regional scale is still needed; municipalities could benefit from collaboration with the research community for state of the art methods. One obstacle for implementation of ES is that it is not always easy for laymen to understand and additionally, the ES concept may be weakly supported by science. The municipalities realize that a society on its way towards sustainability takes advantage of new knowledge and that interactions with research will put them in the forefront of new scientific questions. The municipalities ask for research that takes a citizen perspective and research that prioritizes questions other than pure environmental considerations. Priorities in municipality planning are based on local conditions and rely on EIA. Many ecological indicators are already covered in EIA and this is reflected in Swedish Comprehensive Plans (SCP) documents, yet need further analysis is needed to be a part of ES. The SCPs present concepts at a policy level and rarely provide a more detailed plan of action compatible with the ES approach. New information We found that the use of ES concepts in Swedish Comprehensive Plans and in EIA is still not common and in need of further support from research and in practice. The EIA is decisive for comprehensive planning documents in the Swedish municipalities and follows standard format over time and between municipalities. ES is focused on human needs while the EIA describes place based assessments on environmental impact rather than feedback to the society by the intervention. Municipalities of south Sweden ask for research support in many different areas, for instance how to set up proper organization for implementation of ES and environmental issues, but priorities are based on their local conditions. The results shows that collaboration between stakeholders and researchers is needed which can create incentives, so that the decisions made by individuals, communities, corporations, and governments may be able to promote widely shared values compatible with ES. Researchers and municipalities who work on an operational level face many challenges in promoting greater use of the ES approach, with some of them yet to be defined. We conclude that implementation of ES could draw from lessons learned in the use of EIA. Further, it is presented that ES has the potential for greater public and stakeholder feedback into decisions as compared to EIA. © 2016, Pensoft Publishers. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ongoing urbanization leads to problems such as densification, loss of biodiversity, and social injustice in cities. For increasing urban populations, green???blue infrastructure (GBI) is an important element in compact cities contributing to human health, well-being, and the provision of important ecosystem services. We analyzed responses from two open-ended questions about visions, ideas, and topics for the development and management of GBI important for citizens of the city of Leipzig, Germany. The questions were part of an online survey accompanying the development of the local GBI planning strategy: Master Plan Green. The strategy is focusing on five guiding themes that are leading local and global debates about sustainable and resilient cities: biodiversity, climate adaptation, environmental justice, health, and sustainable mobility. We categorize citizens' ideas and suggestions, summarize frequent problems and conflicts, and link ideas and visions to the five guiding themes. As the last step, we discuss citizens' suggestions in order to minimize conflicts in GBI and to identify deficits in present local planning. Major problems and conflicts that were addressed by respondents relate to quality, usability, other users, activities, and safety and security of GBI. Numerous suggestions aimed to tackle these problems, for example, by designating separate use areas, adding naturalness, improving maintenance, and enhancing facilities. A range of ideas and suggestions were based on diverging expectations underpinning the challenge of matching heterogeneous demands of GBI users in an equitable fashion. Linking these suggestions to the five guiding themes reveals that most ideas are covered by one or several guiding themes and are considered in local planning strategies. However, findings also demonstrate that increasing the quantity of Leipzig's GBI is a central request from respondents. Sociocultural and economic aspects as well as conflicting demands among citizens should further be central to GBI planning to avoid injustice and achieve sustainability objectives. This analysis gives insights into opinions and visions of citizens regarding the development of the city's GBI network and thus substantiates major strategic and planning themes leading global and local urban strategies toward sustainable cities. Considering specific suggestions and GBI deficits that bother citizens on a local level, offers the opportunity to improve the social and ecological resilience of GBI.

AB  - One of the specific consequences of global warming processes is the increase in the unique phenomena associated with storms and sea storms, whose intensity and frequency tend to grow significantly, with the consequent increase of risks in cities and citizens. Therefore, one of the specific goals of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals is by2030, to reduce the number of deaths and people affected by disasters, including those related to water, will be reduced significantly, and reducing substantial direct economic losses linked to the global gross domestic product caused by disasters, with particular emphasis on the protection of the poor and people in vulnerable situations. In Spain, the incidence of these floods and storms has been traditional due to their specific geographic and meteorological conditions. In this article, the aim is to consider the extent to which planned or ongoing actions will be able to reduce these risks in Spanish cities for the aforementioned horizon 2030 and, where appropriate, supplementary measures that could be effective in achieving the intended objective.

AB  - Recent major global environmental initiatives toward a more sustainable society are the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the New Urban Agenda (NUA) and the Paris Agreement. The built environment has been recognised as a major contributor to loss of biodiversity and should therefore play a major role in a sustainable world where ecological values are enhanced. There should be a smooth interaction between the built environment and the natural environment because humanity and nature are the usual victims of loss of biodiversity. The purpose of this paper is to examine the link between the Built Environment, Biodiversity and the Sustainable Development Goals. The paper explores the role of a sustainable built environment towards biodiversity conservation which is central to the realisation of the SDGs in general and SDG 15 in particular. The paper adopts a qualitative research methodology using knowledge generation workshop involving 16 experts from both academia and industry. The results show that, even though the built environment has a negative impact on biodiversity, it also has the greatest opportunity to integrate biodiversity into all development projects. Reducing the impact of the built environment on biodiversity should be an integral part of policies and strategies towards a sustainable built environment. All key built environment stakeholders need to engage in raising awareness of the effects of biodiversity loss as a result of construction activities, on the health and wellbeing of mankind. The value of this paper is to help decision-makers such as government agencies, industry-players and non-governmental organisations to understand the contributions of the built environment towards biodiversity conservation in achieving the SDGs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Urbanization displaces agriculture and natural ecosystems, constraining food security and carbon (C) sinks. A proposed solution, Urban Food Forestry (UFF), promises local food from trees that can sequester C faster than other land cover types as long as soil function can sustain increased above and belowground productivity. We compared fine-scale variation in soil physical, chemical and biological properties within and between UFF and traditional lawn for evidence of changes in belowground ecosystem services. Both land covers sequestered C, but UFF did so 834% faster, especially in upper soil strata where soil bulk density fell by 50% and microbial activity increased by 1167%. Species richness of both soil fungi and bacteria increased along with nutrient concentrations. Contrary to expectations, that different tree traits would drive increasing fine scale variability in C density, soils beneath the UFF became more uniform, which is consistent with the rapid emergence of system-level regulation. Soil C mass balance may distinguish forests from collections of trees and determine how long UFF helps cities store their carbon and eat it too.

AB  - Urban particulate air pollution is a serious health issue. Trees within cities can remove fine particles from the atmosphere and consequently improve air quality and human health. Tree effects on PM2.5 concentrations and human health are modeled for 10 U.S. cities. The total amount of PM 2.5 removed annually by trees varied from 4.7 tonnes in Syracuse to 64.5 tonnes in Atlanta, with annual values varying from $1.1 million in Syracuse to $60.1 million in New York City. Most of these values were from the effects of reducing human mortality. Mortality reductions were typically around 1 person yr-1 per city, but were as high as 7.6 people yr-1 in New York City. Average annual percent air quality improvement ranged between 0.05% in San Francisco and 0.24% in Atlanta. Understanding the impact of urban trees on air quality can lead to improved urban forest management strategies to sustain human health in cities. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recently, urban beekeeping has been recognized as an important activity capable of generating many environmental, economic, and social benefits for society. Urban beekeeping is considered a valuable activity that balances the increase in honey production and urban biodiversity conservation in a sustainable way. However, there is no available literature on citizens’ perceptions and willingness to support urban beekeeping at the local level financially. This study investigated the citizens’ perceptions and willingness to pay (WTP) for urban beekeeping in a case study in Italy. To this end, an online survey was administered with a sample of citizens of the Taino municipality near the Milan metropolitan area, where there is a project to realize an urban apiary. At the end of data collection, 153 citizens completed the questionnaire, corresponding to approximately 5% of inhabitants. The results highlighted that for most respondents, the main benefits provided by urban apiaries are related to the awareness and educational activities on the role of honey bees in the urban environment. Besides, the results showed that 60.1% of respondents are willing to contribute financially to the construction of the municipal apiary through a one-time donation, while the remaining 39.9% said they were not willing to contribute financially, citing reasons for protest. The average WTP was estimated at € 22.21 per person, corresponding to a total value of € 48,742.24. The findings can be considered a starting point to help decision-makers understand the importance of urban beekeeping not only from an environmental but also from a socio-economic point of view. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - There is increasing focus on designing liveable cities that promote walking. However, urban walking routes can expose people to adverse environmental conditions that reduce health, well-being and biodiversity. Our primary objective is to assess how urban form is associated with environmental quality, including biodiversity, for people moving through urban spaces. We assess a range of environmental conditions that influence human health and biodiversity (temperature, noise and particulate pollution) and biodiversity of three taxa (trees, butterflies and birds) along 700 m public walking routes embedded in 500 m x 500 m grid cells across three UK towns. Cells are selected using random stratification across an urbanisation intensity gradient. Walking routes in more built-up areas were noisier and hotter; noise levels further increased in areas with more industrial land-use and large roads. There was no evidence of vegetation mitigating noise or temperature, but there was some evidence that increased vegetation cover mitigated small particulate pollution. Walking routes in more built-up environments had lower butterfly, bird and native tree species richness, and reduced butterfly abundance. Large roads were associated with reduced bird species richness and increased noise was associated with reduced bird abundance. Most specific measures of vegetation in the surrounding matrix (median patch size, structural complexity at 1.5 m resolution) were not detectably associated with biodiversity along walking routes, indicating minimal beneficial spill-over. Increased garden cover in the surrounding matrix was associated with less abundant and less species-rich butterfly communities. Our results highlight considerable heterogeneity in the environmental quality of urban walking routes and pedestrians’ potential to experience biodiversity along these routes, driven by reduced quality in areas with more built cover. A greater focus is needed on mitigating adverse effects of specific features of the built environment (roads, industrial areas, noise) surrounding walking routes to enhance the co-benefits of more biodiversity and healthier conditions for pedestrians. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - The urban agriculture is fully developed for several years and we estimated that more than 75% of the world population will live in urban zones before 2050. The food supply and the food safety are threatened and the urban agriculture could help to solve this problem. VERDIR is a global and integrated project carried by the University of Liège to contribute to the social, cultural, environmental, and economic transition in the South part of Belgium (Wallonia). Wallonia cultivates the tradition of steel and iron for centuries and inventories estimate the number of brownfields in approximately 5000, representing a total surface about 10,000 hectares. Eighty percent of these former industrial sites are situated in peri-urban and urban zones. Moreover, the active steel and iron industries reject important quantities of hot waters, hot gases, and carbon dioxide in the environment. These industrial thermal discharges represent more than 20% of the energy consumed in Wallonia. The possibilities of rehabilitating former industrial sites or the valorization of industrial thermal discharges are numerous. But, recently the urban farming and the development of plant factories have become more and more an important renovation model of brownfields offering new jobs and new industrial sectors.The VERDIR project is a new rehabilitation concept of industrial sites, which mixes the practices of urban agriculture and the production of biomass to high added value molecule. VERDIR project is the beginning of a new economic model based on circular economy, short circuits, collective intelligence, coworking, and social innovation. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Green spaces in cities provide cultural ecosystems services (CES) such as nature connection, wildlife interaction and aesthetic appreciation which can improve aspects of human well-being. Recognising these benefits, researchers are now examining the complex relationship between humans and nature in urban social-ecology. Most studies investigate people's appreciation and valuation of different green space features and their contribution to urban biodiversity. Recommendations arising from such studies are best practices to achieve a balance between landscape aesthetic and ecological objectives, but many knowledge gaps still exist. In a social-ecological project in Greater London, appreciation of ponds and dragonflies in urban green spaces, and the environmental factors determining dragonfly diversity were investigated. We found ponds and their appearance were valued by people as enhancing their green space experience. The preference for wild-looking ponds was moderate. Dragonflies were enjoyed for their colour and high visibility, especially by those who had basic dragonfly knowledge. Species richness of dragonflies was positively associated with habitat heterogeneity in and around a pond. However, people were unable to relate a heterogeneous pond to more dragonfly species. For the first time, some factors that influence the human appreciation-ponds-dragonflies (HPD) relationship in an urban context are revealed. To fully realise the CES potential of ponds and dragonflies in Greater London, a HPD framework is proposed. The framework underpins strategies that foster cultural sustainability for ponds and dragonfly conservation.

AB  - The environment, the climate emergency and the challenge of nature conservation and biodiversity are crucial issues. In urban areas, where the effects of climate change and the increase in pollutants are most pronounced, the Ecosystem Services offered by greenery, such as the removal of air pollutants, the absorption and sequestration of CO2 and the mitigation of high urban temperatures, produce significant benefits for communities. This research focuses on the ability of green infrastructure to reduce concentrations of dangerous air pollutants, namely Particulate Matter (PM) and ground-level ozone. First, the mechanisms of the uptake of both PM and ozone by vegetation are investigated, highlighting their effects on human health. Then, a critical review of the main approaches to estimating economic costs and benefits related to the change in mortality and morbidity caused by air pollution is proposed. Finally, on the basis of literature data, an indicative value of the economic benefit for Italy related to fewer deaths due to improved air quality is suggested. The perspective of the paper is the definition of a model capable of correlating the levels of particulate matter and ozone absorbed annually by vegetation with the monetary value of the corresponding ecosystem service. This is done by estimating both the reduced health costs resulting from the reduction of diseases and the economic benefits resulting from the reduced number of deaths. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Urban environments rely on the surrounding natural ecosystems remnants as providers of ecosystem functions, therefore these areas not only support a unique biodiversity but also have a social value for maintaining public health andwellbeing. For this reason, urbanization is considered to be one the biggest threats to ecosystems, leading to native biodiversity simplification and, thus, to a detriment of the provided ecosystemservices.Moreover, this change in land use results in high levels of landscape fragmentation and modification in areas surrounding the habitat remnantswhich, in consequence, become inadequate formany native species. In this context, it is important that urban planners have the information to assess the possible consequences of future changes in land use in order to increase the landscape chances of supporting both, native biodiversity and the needs of a growing human population. The objective of the present work is to evaluate the ecological integrity of natural and semi-natural vegetation patches immersed in an urban area in order to generate a conceptual framework for landscape assessment that allows urban planners to envision the best choice for city development at a given place. To do so, we developed a quantitative integral environmental evaluation index that includes ecological characterization, geological characterization, and environmental characterization (presence of anthropic disturbance) of the assessed area. We conclude that the index we have generated in this work is suitable to be used as a management tool to allow an unbiased valuation and to identify managing situations that require a short term response. © 2015, University of Tehran.

AB  - The nature-based systems (NBS) are nature inspired, unflagging, efficient, and budget friendly ideas that evolved as ideal technologies for wastewater treatment. The present study deals with the purification of residential wastewater through the NBS, covering three seasons. The NBS embedded with the Canna lily effectively eliminated organic matter, nutrients, and heavy metals. Nearly 57.2-75.2% COD, 69.9-83.2% BOD, 73.4-90.6% TSS, 51.1-71.6% PO43--P, 66.3-84.8% NH4+-N, 52-61.5% NO3--N, and 68-70.6% NO2--N removal were achieved. Heavy metals like Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mo, and Pb were removed, with a 98.25% reduction in the total bacterial count. The pollutant removal's kinetics was calculated using first-order kinetics. The mass removal rate of BOD was high in monsoon (22.3 g/m(2)/d), and COD was high in summer (36.4 g/m(2)/d). Organic compound removal (65.2%), including emerging pollutants, was observed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) analysis of water and Canna samples. Wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (WDXRF) studied the elements and oxides retention by media and accumulation by the plant. The CHN content of the Canna and its morphological study was checked using the carbon CHNS analyzer and scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX), respectively. The performance of the NBS was validated using variance, correlation, and principal component analysis (PCA). This study shows the NBS effects on the remediation of environmental and emerging contaminants from residential wastewater and further use it for horticultural activities, thereby achieving sustainable development goals.

AB  - The global nature-climate crisis along with a fundamental shift in world population towards cities and towns has sharpened the focus on the role of urban green infrastructure. Green infrastructure has the potential to deliver cost-effective, nature-based solutions to help mitigate problems of climate change as well as provide improved human well-being through the ecosystem services inherent in landscapes rich in biodiversity. The absence of under-pinning science, specifically complex systems science and ecosystem theory in the design and planning of urban green infrastructure, has limited the capacity of these landscapes to deliver ecosystem services and to effectively demonstrate natural resilience to the impacts of climate change. To meet future challenges of environmental uncertainty and social change, the design of urban green space should embrace an adaptive ecosystem-based approach that includes fully integrated participatory planning and implementation strategies founded on principles of close to nature science. Our article offers two models to inform green space planning: urban green space framework and sustainable urban community network. Both concepts provide the foundation for six ecosystem-based design principles. In a case study on Essex green infrastructure, UK, recommendations made by the Essex Climate Action Commission to transform land management practices are presented as examples of adopting principles of the ecosystem approach and nature-based science. Our article concludes by emphasising the importance of reconnecting society with nature in cities through close-to-nature design of urban green space to secure essential ecosystem services and to build resilience to the impacts of climate change.

AB  - Costa Rica is recognized worldwide for its nature conservation policy following the traditional land-sparing approach. However, concerns have been raised about the opposite trends of the agricultural land cover changes driven by the option to expand old and new export crops after the country's external debt crisis of the 1980s. We study what happened during the last 20 years by applying landscape ecology metrics to the REDD+ land cover maps of 1986, 2001, and 2014, and statistically testing these indicators with the locations of species richness of plants and birds recorded by INBio. Our results confirm that deforestation has been reversed and most of the biodiversity considered is housed in forestland, but also that the expansion of export monocultures and urban sprawl have fragmented and isolated these tropical forests. Ecological connectivity values decreased 13% across the territory, all crops are negatively correlated with bird and plant locations, and the metropolitan expansion caused a detrimental impact on coffee agroforestry. All these outcomes are consistent with the growing deficit of the Costa Rican physical trade balance due to a faster increase of tropical exports than the growing imports of staple food, with a loss of soil organic matter filled by high doses of agrochemicals imported. Overcoming these environmental problems require a new land-sharing approach to nature conservation aimed at improving ecological connectivity through an agroecology approach combined with land-use planning to preserve the remaining green belt of the shade coffee plantations as a buffer green infrastructure in the metropolitan area.

AB  - A relatively unaccounted ecosystem service from biodiversity is the benefit to human health via symbiotic microbiota from our environment. This benefit occurs because humans evolved alongside microbes and have been constantly exposed to diverse microbiota. Plants and animals, including humans, are organised as a host with symbiotic microbiota, whose collective genome and life history form a single holobiont. As such, there are interdependencies between biodiversity, holobionts, and public health which lead us to argue that human health outcomes could be improved by increasing contact with biodiversity in an urban context. We propose that humans, like all holobionts, likely require a diverse microbial habitat to appropriate resources for living healthy, long lives. We discuss how industrial urbanisation likely disrupts the symbiosis between microbiota and their hosts, leading to negative health outcomes. The industrialised urban habitat is low in macro and microbial biodiversity and discourages contact with beneficial environmental microbiota. These habitat factors, alongside diet, antibiotics, and others, are associated with the epidemic of non-communicable diseases in these societies. We suggest that restoration of urban microbial biodiversity and micro-ecological processes through microbiome rewilding can benefit holobiont health and aid in treating the urban non-communicable disease epidemic. Further, we identify research gaps and some solutions to economic and strategic hurdles in applying microbiome rewilding into daily urban life.

AB  - Many coastal waters are designated under the federal Clean Water Act to be used for swimming and shellfishing. While Congress has established a legal obligation to protect and restore these "existing" uses of coastal waters, conventional stormwater management measures fail to adequately treat and remove bacteria from urban stormwater runoff. This means that as development occurs these existing uses of coastal waters are frequently prohibited to protect public health. This presentation examines the potential of Low-Impact Development (LID) practices to successfully prevent and reverse this persistent and widespread form of water quality degradation in urbanizing coastal areas. The legal water-quality protection imperatives that LID must satisfy are identified, technical challenges unique to coastal areas discussed, and real life experiences with LID use and performance along the coast on North Carolina reviewed. The conclusion is that LID has the potential to protect and restore coastal water quality as long as it successfully replicates natural hydrology, and LID strategies should become the cornerstone of watershed management strategies including Total Maximum Daily Load implementation plans. © 2009 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Environmental factors play an important role in obesity-related behaviors. Evidence indicates significant associations between weight and urban green spaces in adults, but it is not clear whether this relationship applies to adolescents. Therefore, our aim was to determine the associations between urban green spaces, greenness exposure and species richness in residential environments with physical activity and body mass index. Sixty-two adolescents between 12 and 18 years of age answered a self-administered questionnaire, providing information on height, weight, age, sex and home address. Data on socioeconomic deprivation were obtained from the European Index of Deprivation for Small Portuguese Areas. Physical activity levels were assessed using accelerometers. Urban green space counts and the normalized difference vegetation index values were measured using buffers along the roads with distances of 300, 500, 1000 and 1500 m from each participant’s residence. To quantify the species richness, the species richness index was used. Linear regression models were fitted to analyze whether urban green spaces, exposure to green spaces and species richness counts for each distance were associated with physical activity and self-reported body mass index. We did not find significant associations between the independent variables and the probability of overweight or obesity. The relationship between environmental variables, adolescents’ physical activity and body weight seems to be complex and further studies may contribute to better understanding of the topic. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Green spaces in urban areas-like remnant habitat, parks, constructed wetlands, and street trees-supply multiple benefits. Many studies show green spaces in and near urban areas play important roles harbouring biodiversity and promoting human well-being. On the other hand, evidence suggests that greater human population density enables compact, low-carbon cities that spare habitat conversion at the fringes of expanding urban areas, while also allowing more walkable and livable cities. How then can urban areas have abundant green spaces as well as density? In this paper, we review the empirical evidence for the relationships between urban density, nature, and sustainability. We also present a quantitative analysis of data on urban tree canopy cover and open space for United States large urbanized areas, as well as an analysis of non-US Functional Urban Areas in OECD countries. We found that there is a negative correlation between population density and these green spaces. For Functional Urban Areas in the OECD, a 10% increase in density is associated with a 2.9% decline in tree cover. We argue that there are competing trade-offs between the benefits of density for sustainability and the benefits of nature for human well-being. Planners must decide an appropriate density by choosing where to be on this trade-off curve, taking into account city-specific urban planning goals and context. However, while the negative correlation between population density and tree cover is modest at the level of US urbanized areas (R2 = 0.22), it is weak at the US Census block level (R2 = 0.05), showing that there are significant brightspots, neighbourhoods that manage to have more tree canopy than would be expected based upon their level of density. We then describe techniques for how urban planners and designers can create more brightspots, identifying a typology of urban forms and listing green interventions appropriate for each form. We also analyse policies that enable these green interventions illustrating them with the case studies of Curitiba and Singapore. We conclude that while there are tensions between density and urban green spaces, an urban world that is both green and dense is possible, if society chooses to take advantage of the available green interventions and create it.

AB  - Protecting nature is a fundamental aspect of local and Indigenous cultures that has more recently become an urban sustainability goal. The benefits provided by nature to people and other species have sparked an upsurge in research exploring how best to manage existing nature in urban environments. Here we expand this focus by drawing attention to an emerging pathway of research and practice that is engaged with the idea of bringing nature back into cities (BNB). We argue that BNB could be a vital force of the 21st century urban-sustainability agenda. However, the enthusiasm of practitioners and policymakers for incorporating BNB objectives into local and global strategies remains uneven. As interdisciplinary scholars involved with the theory and practice of caring for urban nature, we believe that the time is ripe to present a fresh perspective on seven key areas that can unlock the potential of actions to bring nature back into cities. Specifically, we: (a) argue that the sovereignty of local and Indigenous knowledge-systems be acknowledged and respected; (b) contend that the choice of bringing nature back actions should be driven by inclusive decision-making; (c) discuss advances in ecology that need to be addressed to facilitate the return of nature into cities; (d) outline how the diffusion of innovation theory may assist communication of BNB actions to stakeholders; (e) discuss how built-environment professionals can demonstrate the value of urban infrastructure for BNB; (f) call for longitudinal research to understand, quantify and qualify the benefits of BNB actions and (g) consider solutions needed to address concerns about potential risks and disservices associated with actions to bring nature back into urban environments. Taken together, these perspectives, and the transdisciplinary framework that emerges from them, embody theoretical innovation regarding how to bring nature back into cities and a holistic view of how to make this happen in practice. Bringing nature back into cities has the potential to become an environmentally just and culturally inclusive dimension of the 21st urban sustainability agenda upon which future generations of city-dwellers rely.

AB  - In an urbanized world, the challenges posed by climate change need to be met through innovative planning for cities and regions. Urban resilience demands that cities adopt new models centered on carbon neutrality, ecosystem services and biodiversity enhancement, circularity, and social inclusion. In light of the multiple interdependencies of metropolitan systems and the natural and territorial potentialities present on their fringes, this paper discusses the metropolitan fringes as strategic for urban resilience and sustainable transitions. By combining a mixed-method analysis of adaptation and urban plans with semi-structured interviews performed with key technicians, the analysis is focused on an inter-municipal fringe zone within the Barcelona Metropolitan Area - the Bes`os territory. Aiming to contribute to the discussions related to Territorial innovation for cities and regions, the paper offers a multi-scale perspective and illustrates innovative urban transformation strategies across scales. The results highlight that governance and multiple planning and participation instances together with technical and financial support are essential for consensus building in an incremental process. Furthermore, the planning strategies of the case study sought to integrate and enhance the green and blue infrastructures and transform consolidated urban areas with a focus on energy transition, sustainable mobility, circularity, and social inclusion. In conclusion, it is argued that resilience has a multi-scalar perspective within the metropolitan context and should be integrated with planning policies at different scales from a coordinated vision. Although adaptation and urban projects have a critical local element, a broader and more strategic vision is necessary, especially in metropolitan fringe areas.

AB  - Changes in land use and land cover (LULC) are caused by several factors, including climate change, socio-demographic dynamics, human pressures and urban sprawl. These factors alter the structure and functionality of ecosystems and their capacity to provide ecosystem goods and services to society. The study of LULC changes is important for understanding the dynamics of relationships between environmental, social and economic components and for analyzing the factors affecting natural capital. Including ecosystem services (ES) in spatial planning tools and sectoral policies is useful for improving governance. In this paper, the impact of LULC changes on ES provision has been estimated. To this end, we carried out a literature review (Step 1) to select the biophysical and economic coefficients of ES supply by land cover classes and collect them in a database (Step 2). We subsequently aggregated the economic and biophysical coefficients by macro classes (Step 3) and, using the benefit transfer approach, we estimated the change in the supply of ESs concerning permanence and transition phenomena in Italy from 1990 to 2018 (Step 4). The transition phenomena analysis also allowed us to evaluate the consequences of urbanization and urban green space governance on ES supply. Indeed, these urban green spaces can help reduce risks to people's health and safety and mitigate the effects induced by climate change. In total, approximately 800 coefficients (biophysical and economic) of ESs supplied by Corine Land Cover classes were acquired. The results show a reduction in the annual supply of ecosystem services of EUR 927 million (2022) caused by LULC changes between 1990 and 2018. This research proposes a methodology to improve knowledge of ESs concerning anthropogenic impacts and to support land-use planning policies regarding Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goals.

AB  - Much research and media attention has revolved around the environmental impacts of growing global human populations. While the conclusions remain contested, these assessments have largely neglected the ecological and conservation impacts of other key regional processes such as declining populations, ageing demographics and rural-to-urban migration. These demographic shifts are increasingly prevalent across many regions of the world, and will have significant direct effects on natural resource management and biodiversity conservation by altering individual consumption patterns, land use, land stewardship and natural disturbances. Given that the scientific foundation around this topic is still developing, we first present an initial examination of some of the key environmental impacts, aiming to elevate awareness and encourage further research in these areas. Beyond the ecological implications, declining populations, ageing demographics and rural-to-urban migration carry intricate social and cultural consequences that can affect people and nature interactions. Ecological studies that focus on single dimensions of biodiversity or ecosystem responses often overlook these complexities. Demographic changes are likely to be accompanied by shifts in environmental attitudes and connections with nature, all of which will influence our capacity to adapt to or mitigate environmental changes. Finally, environmental policy and practice frameworks are potentially unprepared and their success could be sensitive to these socio-cultural and demographic shifts. Synthesis and applications: This brief overview demonstrates that population decline, ageing and rural-to-urban migration can have extensive implications for biodiversity and the socio-cultural relationships between people and nature. However, the significance, dynamics and consequences of these processes are still largely overlooked. We believe that these changes warrant specific attention from the research, policy and practice communities, as understanding the outcomes and feedbacks associated with depopulation, ageing populations, loss of culture and tradition and ecological change could aid in designing landscapes and informing management that enhances both human well-being and biodiversity conservation. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Transformation towards low carbon development needs action to transform our economy and energy simulta-neously. India has taken several noble aims for continuing to increase renewable energy since an efficient energy transition will help to mitigate climate change. Socio-economic consequences like a considerable loss of liveli-hood will also occur. The 'just transition' concept emphasises delivering the transition fairly to high carbon concentrated workers' communities' livelihood and fossil fuel-based economy towards the regenerative economy and addressing inequality and poverty issues. While nature-based solutions are initiatives taken to restore, protect, and sustainably manage nature to tackle societal problems such as changing climate, challenges origi-nating from urban expansion and livelihood support. There is a substantial research gap on why efforts to address just transition should support nature-based solutions (NbS). This research paper tries to offer a detailed perspective regarding the possibilities of delivering just transition and relate it to nature-based solutions based on available literature and various examples worldwide.

AB  - Environmental degradation is a serious concern and its prevention strategies have become a central topic worldwide. It is widely accepted that improving environmental quality is essential for advancing sustainable development and societal well-being. From this perspective, the present research employed panel data from 1990 to 2022 from BRICST economies to assess the effects of financial development, human capital, urban population, energy consumption, and economic growth on environmental quality regarding ecological footprint. This study employs second-generation empirical techniques such as CIPS and CADF unit root tests, Westerlund bootstrap cointegration, and DFE/MG/PMG-ARDL models to examine the connections among the studied variables. The empirical findings of this study uncover that in the BRICST countries, environmental quality is exacerbated by human capital, urban population, energy consumption, and economic growth. On the other hand, financial development and GDP2 help improve environmental quality. Additionally, the interaction of the term financial development results with the terms human capital and urban population has a negative effect and reduces ecological footprint by improving environmental quality. From the policy perspective, the selected countries must implement policies that promote equitable financial resources, plan sustainable urbanization to promote compact cities and green infrastructure, and invest in green energy to address the adverse environmental consequences in BRICST economies. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Green infrastructure (GI), a network of nature, semi-natural areas and green space, delivers essential ecosystem services which underpin human well-being and quality of life. Maintaining ecosystem services through the development of GI is therefore increasingly recognized by policies as a strategy to cope with potentially changing conditions in the future. This paper assessed how current trends of land-use change have an impact on the aggregated provision of eight ecosystem services at the regional scale of the European Union, measured by the Total Ecosystem Services Index (TESI8). Moreover, the paper reports how further implementation of GI across Europe can help maintain ecosystem services at baseline levels. Current demographic, economic and agricultural trends, which affect land use, were derived from the so called Reference Scenario. This scenario is established by the European Commission to assess the impact of energy and climate policy up to 2050. Under the Reference Scenario, economic growth, coupled with the total population, stimulates increasing urban and industrial expansion. TESI8 is expected to decrease across Europe between 0 and 5 % by 2020 and between 10 and 15 % by 2050 relative to the base year 2010. Based on regression analysis, we estimated that every additional percent increase of the proportion of artificial land needs to be compensated with an increase of 2.2 % of land that qualifies as green infrastructure in order to maintain ecosystem services at 2010 levels. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Fair trade is both a movement and a market, and the tension between these two domains reflects an ambiguity at the center of fair trade in the United States, resulting from long-standing debates within the contemporary movement. In practice, this ideological division produces a struggle between companies that offer a small number of fair trade products aside a vast number of conventional items, and those that sell only fair trade certified products. However, it also shapes the experience of on-the-ground fair trade advocacy work. This article uses Gibson-Graham's diverse economies framework to explore three arenas in which this is most clearly evidenced. First, some fair trade advocates are wary of Fair Trade USA's (FTUSA) power and strategies. They are aware that multiple fair trade certification frameworks currently exist; however they aren't always sure which ones are most desirable and why. This confusion can be problematic in Fair Trade Towns (FTT) advocacy work which involves convincing community members, institutions and governments to purchase more fair trade products. Second, in light of FTUSA's strategic marketization of fair trade and the entry of large corporate players into the U.S. fair trade market, fair trade advocates increasingly find themselves in the equivocal position of providing free labor and marketing for large corporations. Third, the efforts of some FTT advocates are stymied by the determined localvores in their community who are more focused on minimizing carbon footprints and supporting local farmers than promoting social justice and environmental stewardship in the developing world. These tensions raise important questions about the scalar politics of alternative markets and diverse economies.

AB  - A range of published and grey literature over the last three decades has underlined the importance of urban and peri-urban agriculture and forestry (UPAF) in cities of developing regions. The focus in the published literature is on livelihoods, poverty reduction and ecosystems services at multiple city scales. Cities of developing regions, particularly in Africa, are searching for ways of addressing the unavoidable impacts of climate change and UPAF has demonstrated scalable adaptation and mitigation potential. However, evidence of UPAF's role in mitigating and adaptation to climate change is scattered in various reports and has not been synthesized for its potential role in developing urban adaptation strategies. Building on the earlier poverty reduction focus of UPAF research, this paper contributes to UPAF knowledge regarding mitigating and adapting to climate change in urban and peri-urban areas in East and West Africa. The paper reports a synthesis based on a systematic review of the available literature on these regions, and selected sources on other parts of sub-Saharan Africa. The paper also examines the extent to which literature conveys any evidence for UPAF playing a role in mediating the effects of climate/environmental change. Limited empirical verification was undertaken in Kampala and Ibadan, but this does not form the basis for systematic generalization. The key emerging areas of adaptation and mitigation include enhanced food security, productive greening, ecosystem services and innovative policy for urban resilience and transformation.

AB  - Urban planning and design in the 21st century is increasingly focusing on sustainability, illustrated by the proliferation of greener cities. While operational definitions and the actual planning of these cities can vary considerably (e.g., eco cities and low carbon cities), conceptually, at least, these terms overlap, particularly with regard to how they attempt to achieve both greener infrastructural design and healthier human lifestyles. This paper presents the findings of survey-based research carried out within Lingang New Town in Shanghai in 2019. In the cities of the Global North, the interplay between green infrastructural provision and public health has been of interest, especially in the context of social inequalities; however, there is little research from rapidly urbanizing countries where green urbanism is being increasingly promoted. Using this newly constructed example, we identified a clear positive correlation between moving to a green city and the adoption of healthier lifestyles. The structural equation modelling results suggest that behaviors around the use of green space as well as perceptions of different green space have notable impacts on residents’ physical health, measured by body mass index (BMI). The findings further illustrate systemic inequalities among private housing, rental housing and public housing typologies with regard to the distribution of health benefits. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) by urbanization will likely replace agricultural expansion as the dominant source of transformation of the terrestrial biosphere. Properly managed urban soils can offset some of the associated carbon (C) losses from urban soils and vegetation by retaining stabilized soil organic carbon (SOC) or soil inorganic carbon (SIC) such as mineral-associated C, black carbon (BC), and stable carbonate minerals. For example, SOC stocks of up to 810 Mg C ha(-1) to 1.5 m depth (Serebryanye Prudy, Russia) and SIC stocks of up to 300 Mg C ha(-1) to 2.5 m depth (Newcastle upon Tyne, UK) have been reported, but data on urban soil C storage are scanty. Aside from contributing to climate change mitigation, protecting and increasing SOC stocks support critically important soil-derived ecosystem services. Thus, C-friendly soil and land-use management practices must be developed and implemented to enhance soil-derived ecosystem services in urban areas, and the resilience of urban ecosystems to climate change. A collective management approach for urban soil C is needed. The principal actors involved should be urban land users (e.g., urban dwellers, property owners, developers) as the immediate users and managers of soil C, local professionals, local government and NGOs.

AB  - Horticultural products and services impact the health and well-being of urban populations. This is an extremely important group for horticultural scientists and researchers to serve: More than half of all people worldwide already live in urban areas, and more than two-thirds will do so by 2050. In this chapter we address the past, current, and future roles that horticultural science plays in the major issues of concern to public welfare: public health, environmental health, food security, and economic stability. Urban horticulture has important impacts on the health of the individual and the community, two concerns of public health. Documented individual health benefits include less depression and improved pregnancy outcomes from walking in or living near urban green spaces. Community gardens, parks, and other urban vegetation enhance community health by improving social interactions, such as family dynamics, and public safety, such as protection from crimes. Uses of plants to improve the urban environment include temperature modification, air pollution reduction, and water quality improvement. Impacts on biological diversity are mixed. Other negative impacts include the introduction of invasive species. Urban food security requires food in sufficient, nutritious, and affordable quantities. Providing this for all people is one of the greatest challenges for horticultural science. Potential solutions include increasing small-scale food production in urban areas by providing more community gardens or converting vacant lots. Horticulture contributes directly to urban economics through the production and sales of horticultural products by urban businesses. Indirect contributions from plants include higher property values and more productive employees. The increasing urbanization and aging of the human population is happening in conjunction with rising environmental destruction from global warming and climate change. Combining the traditional horticultural concern of feeding the world with an expanded understanding of the additional functions provided by horticultural products, the needs of urban people, and the opportunities to partner with professionals in other disciplines will be essential in the unpredictable future. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.

AB  - With rapid urban expansion and economic development, water shortages and high energy emissions at the regional scale pose critical challenges for urban agglomerations, resulting in quite intricate water-energy nexus. Although important, an assessment framework that can analyze interregional and intersectoral water-energy nexus among cities at the urban agglomeration scale is still lacking. Based on an environmentally extended multiregional input-output model and the concepts of virtual water and embodied energy, this study developed a new assessment framework for the water-energy nexus. By jointly considering the efficiency of input resources and the connections of interregional industrial sectors, this framework can be used to identify the key regions and sectors for water and energy saving. Using the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration as an example, the new framework revealed that electricity, gas and water supply industry in Zhangjiakou was a typical high water consumption-high energy consumption sector. Light industry and construction belong to a strong water-energy connection sector, whereas the water-saving measures only partially focus on reducing water consumption but promote energy consumption. In the future, it is imperative to improve the water-energy utilization efficiency of upstream sectors and promote the concept of green buildings with low environmental impacts. The developed framework can be further extended to capture food-energy-water nexus from regional to global scale, and can be used as an important toolbox to pinpoint the sector to realize the sustainable development goals of "clean water and sanitation" (SDG6) and "affordable and clean energy" (SDG7).

AB  - Amidst the increasingly escalating global concern regarding climate change, adopting a low-carbon approach has become crucial for charting the future developmental trajectory of urban areas. It also offers a novel angle for cities to avoid high-temperature risks. This paper estimates carbon emissions in Wuhan City from both direct and indirect aspects. Then, the ANN (artificial neural network)–CA (Cellular Automata) model is employed to establish three distinct development scenarios (Ecological Priority, Tight Growth, and Natural Growth) to predict future urban expansion. Additionally, the WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting Model)—UCM (Urban Canopy Model) model is used to investigate the thermal environmental impacts of varying urban development scenarios. This study uses a low-carbon perspective to explore how cities can develop scientifically sound urban strategies to meet climate change challenges and achieve sustainable development goals. The conclusions are as follows: (1) The net carbon emission for Wuhan in 2022 is estimated to be approximately 20.8353 million tonnes. Should the city maintain an average annual emission reduction rate of 10%, the carbon sink capacity of Wuhan would need to be enhanced by 382,200 tonnes by 2060. (2) In the absence of anthropogenic influence, there is a propensity for the urban construction zone of Wuhan to expand primarily towards the southeast and western sectors. (3) The Ecological Priority (EP) and Tight Growth (TG) scenarios are effective in alleviating the urban thermal environment, achieving a reduction of 0.88% and 2.48%, respectively, in the urban heat island index during afternoon hours. In contrast, the Natural Growth (NG) scenario results in a degradation of the urban thermal environment, with a significant increase of over 4% in the urban heat island index during the morning and evening periods. (4) An overabundance of urban green spaces and water bodies could exacerbate the urban heat island effect during the early morning and at night. The findings of this study enhance the comprehension of the climatic implications associated with various urban development paradigms and are instrumental in delineating future trajectories for low-carbon sustainable urban development models. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - To achieve carbon neutrality, most countries focus on reducing carbon footprint and its inequality based on not only production, but also consumption. We applied multi-source data and methods to measure inequality of consumption-based household carbon footprints (HCFs) between income groups and across consumption categories. Results showed that, per capita household carbon footprints (PHCFs) increased continuously in 2011–2017, from 1.75 t CO2 to 2.47 t CO2. The increment was larger and larger owing to the rapidly growing household consumption expenditure. Average PHCF of high-income households was 5.33 times greater than that of low-income households in 2017. The high-income households should be more responsible for reducing HCFs and implementing the shift to the low-carbon lifestyle. Inequality was significant with a Gini coefficient of 0.458 for total PHCFs. The contribution rate of between-group inequality to overall inequality was increasing, from 42.49% in 2011 to 60.39% in 2017. There was the polarization characteristic in the inequality of HCFs between income groups. Gini coefficients of PHCFs for some categories were much greater than that of total PHCFs. It is necessary to focus on these categories such as rent, car purchase, furniture and durable goods to reduce HCF inequality. This study revealed the key income groups and consumption categories contributing most to HCF and its inequality, which could provide the references for carrying on the studies and actions of reducing them in the developing countries. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Growing environmental concerns and the rise of sustainable development have made planners shift focus from prioritizing economic and social benefits to incorporating ecological consciousness into urban planning. Ecological challenges, such as habitat degradation from unchecked urban expansion and insufficient green spaces, underscore gaps in ecological awareness among urban planners. Issues, like urban heat islands and water mismanagement, further exemplify the need for enhanced ecological planning. To address these challenges, the paper proposes several governance strategies. It advocates for comprehensive planning for ecological civilization cities, including green infrastructures and natural landscape restoration to mitigate environmental impacts. Enhancing ecological responsibility, through education and community engagement, is vital for fostering a culture of sustainability. Developing an ecological circular economy addresses resource inefficiency and waste problems, while promoting low-carbon transportation options aims to reduce urban carbon footprints. Guided by the concept of ecological consciousness, this analysis offers actionable paths for improving urban ecological governance. © 2024, Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP).

AB  - The increasing population and continuous urbanization make food security prominent in sustainable development. It is important to develop economic and resource-efficient farming solutions to meet food demand. Renewable energy and waste valorization may bring benefits to build sustainable food production systems and facilitate circular economy. This work aims to develop a decision support framework for the stakeholders to quantitatively assess and optimize their urban farming systems for efficient investment and operation. The proposed framework is based on a holistic system model that considers the energy and material consumption in vegetable production processes and the economic and environmental performance of urban farming systems. In the multi-dimensional assessment model, the net present value and cradle-to-gate CO2 emission, water consumption, and land occupation of different configurations of urban farming systems were assessed. In a further development, the assessment model was embedded in an optimization framework to identify the optimal system design and operation. The optimal crop mix and the corresponding cultivation set points (such as temperature, humidity, irradiance, illumination time, and CO2 concentration) for the farming modules were determined via optimization. To demonstrate the proposed framework, a case study on the design and operation of a vertical farm in Singapore was carried out. The case study examined alternative farming systems with glass-enclosed vs window-free structural design, grid vs solar photovoltaic (PV) energy supply, and traditional chemical fertilizers vs food waste compost fertilization. Results showed that plant-factory farming systems integrated with solar PV and beer-residue-derived fertilizer could be a promising and sustainable farming solution for Singapore as a tropical megacity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Since a solution towards carbon neutrality in already highly populated territories that does not profoundly alter the territories has not yet been found, territorial acupuncture, a new methodology presented in this paper, proposes a solution to this challenge and simultaneously helps to counter the dysfunctional dichotomy between large urban centres and small towns. The aim of this study is therefore to present this new concept and its operation. Hence, a phased study was carried out. Territorial acupuncture is the result of merging different theories and practices, such as Biourbanism, urban acupuncture, and energy community design. For Territorial Acupuncture, the territory is conceived as a single organism and, just like acupuncture in traditional Chinese medicine, punctual interventions (in this case, interconnected energy communities) would benefit the entire territory organism. To make the theory work properly, it will be necessary to carry out multi-scalar and multi-disciplinary analyses over the entire territory to identify the intervention points and then proceed to the design and interconnection of the individual district. Thus, Territorial Acupuncture provides a new approach to the resilience of densely populated territories, which, through punctual interventions on a district scale, benefits the entire territory by modifying energy, socio-economic, and environmental dynamics.

AB  - With growing urban populations and increasing demands for more liveable, healthy and resilient cities, green infrastructure (GI) emerged over the last decade as a strategy to improve the quality of life in urban areas, delivering ecological, socio-cultural and economic benefits. To reach the European Union’s political ambitions, it is vital that the concept and its content are used consistently and coherently from national to local scale. Regarding the content, the ambiguity of the multifunctionality characteristic of GI presents an opportunity for adaptation to local values, while also risking to remain a vague and abstract promise. A policy analysis was conducted in four European cities to investigate the uptake of the GI concept in policies relevant for urban green spaces and if it is in line with EU’s understanding. Additionally, we investigate through interviews how interactions between agencies contribute to the mainstreaming of the concept to the municipal level. We found variations in uptake level and interpretation, which can partly be explained by the competition of new and established concepts, and existing structures (legislation and routines of practice). Each case study made multifunctionality concrete by linking multiple values to it, although the amount of values and depth of consideration differs. We found interactions between policymakers themselves, as well with science and civil society, contributing to the mainstreaming of the concept. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - There has been a surge of academic studies on nature-based solutions in the last decades, reflecting the growing view that nature can help us address the climate and the ecological crises. While definitions of nature-based solutions are commonly referenced in the literature, “nature” itself is rarely defined. This article investigates the ideas of nature in nature-based solutions discourses in urban planning and argues that unpacking their connotations is crucial for a more precise and locally sensitive development of planning for humans and more-than-humans. The findings reveal that “nature” is often used abstractly or through proxies such as ecosystem services or biodiversity. Although the place-specificity of NBS is recognized in the literature, local definitions and values of nature are not sufficiently included, which can compromise the long-term uptake of NBS. The study further highlights the growing recognition of the plural values of nature and the potential for ecocentric approaches to challenge the anthropocentric underpinnings of NBS. The article concludes that unpacking the often-diverging meanings of nature is paramount for a more conscious development of NBS research in planning theory and practice, enhancing the effectiveness, inclusivity, and environmental justice of NBS initiatives and their effective mainstreaming. By embracing plural definitions of nature and fostering a deeper understanding of human-nature relationships, NBS research can support more sustainable, resilient, and equitable urban futures. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - How are our cities using nature-based solutions to confront the challenges posed by a warming climate, the loss of biodiversity and major resource depletion? This article discusses the opportunities and benefits of applying the concepts of regreening and rewilding of cities. The article engages with key sources and summarizes the background and development of regreening and nature-based solutions and important policies, concerns and perspectives of international and national organizations. It introduces the integration of nature-based solutions (NBS) as a strategy in urban planning with the aim to strengthen urban resilience and to slow down the biodiversity decline. Rewilding areas in cities has become a powerful strategy to bring back butterflies, insects, birds, and wildlife. In contrast to highly managed parks and gardens, these rewilding initiatives are leaving allotted spaces mostly uncultivated and self-regulated. Contact to nature is essential for human existence, urban wellbeing, and good quality of life. Green spaces in cities-big or small-all contribute to the health and wellbeing of residents. However, many cities do not offer residents easy access to green space within the city. Improving the better distribution of and access to green spaces and extending gardens and parks is likely to deliver a large number of benefits, such as: ecosystem services, better water management for enhanced urban flood control, slowing down the biodiversity loss, contributing to food security, and restoring damaged ecosystems. Furthermore, additional green space and NBS help to keep cities cool during heatwaves and improve the urban microclimate. Rewilding has emerged as an important part of new public parks and gardens. The next step is to up-scale citywide climate intervention strategies deployed to keep cities cool. However, as the discussion of this article shows, it is essential that the design of these NBS strategies is fully integrated with other complementary planning interventions and seeks synergies across all sectors.

AB  - There is a growing demand for holistic landscape planning to enhance sustainable use of ecosystem services (ESS) and maintenance of the biodiversity that supports them. In this context, the EU is developing policy to regulate the maintenance of ESS and enhance connectivity among protected areas (PAs). This is known as the network of Green Infrastructure (GI). However, there is not a working framework defined to plan the spatial design of such network of GI. Here, we use the software Marxan with Zones, to prioritize the spatial distribution of different management zones that accommodate the needs of a network of GI. These zones included a conservation zone, mainly devoted to protecting biodiversity, a GI zone, that aimed at connecting PAs and maintaining regulating and cultural ESS; and a management zone devoted to exploiting provisioning ESS. We performed four planning scenarios that distribute the targets for ESS and biodiversity in different ways across management zones. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis by increasing ESS targets to explore trade-offs that may occur when managing together biodiversity and ESS. We use Catalonia (northeastern Spain) as a case study. We found that the representation of ESS could be achieved for intermediate targets in all scenarios. There was, however, a threshold on these targets over which trade-offs appeared between maintaining regulating and cultural ESS and biodiversity versus getting access to provisioning ESS. These “thresholds values” were displaced towards higher ESS targets when we moved from more strict to more flexible planning scenarios (i.e., scenarios that allowed mixing representation of objectives for biodiversity and ESS within the same zone). This methodological approach could help design a framework to integrate biodiversity and ESS management in holistic plans and decision making and, at the same time, meeting European mandates concerning the design of GI networks, or similar needs elsewhere. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Treatment wetlands (TWs) are engineered systems that mimic the processes in natural wetlands with the purpose of treating contaminated water. Being a simple and robust technology, TWs are applied worldwide to treat various types of water. Besides treated water for reuse, TWs can be used in resources-oriented sanitation systems for recovering nutrients and carbon, as well as for growing biomass for energy production. Additionally, TWs provide a large number of ecosystem services. Integrating green infrastructure into urban developments can thus facilitate circular economy approaches and has positive impacts on environment, economy and health.

AB  - To address the inter-connected climate and biodiversity crises, it is crucial to understand how multifunctional urban green infrastructure (UGI) is perceived to contribute to carbon neutrality, biodiversity, human well-being, and justice outcomes in cities. We explore how urban residents, including youth, associate carbon-related meanings with multifunctional UGI and how these meanings relate to co-benefits to biodiversity, well-being, and broader sustainability outcomes. Our findings are based on a survey distributed among urban residents of Helsinki, Finland (n = 487) and reveal how carbon-related meanings of UGI manifest at different levels of abstraction, agency, and scale, and incorporate community values and concerns attributed to the planning, features, functions, and transformational dimensions of UGI. Core carbon-related meanings of UGI emphasize either actions towards sustainability, carbon neutrality, biodiversity, or unfamiliarity towards such meanings. Perceived justice concerns and the socio-demographic contexts of the respondents covaried with carbon-related meanings associated with UGI. The results illustrate community perceptions of how it is not only possible, but rather expected, that multifunctional UGI is harnessed to tackle climate change, human well-being, and biodiversity loss in cities. Challenges for implementing the carbon-related benefits of UGI include navigating the different expectations placed on UGI and including residents with diverse socio-economic backgrounds during the process. Our findings contribute to a holistic understanding of how multifunctional UGI can help bridge policy agendas related to carbon neutrality, biodiversity protection, and human well-being that cities can implement when aiming for sustainable, just, and socially acceptable transitions towards a good Anthropocene.

AB  - Green spaces and trees are key elements for enhancing human well-being in cities. Despite recognizing the significance of urban greenery for human health, the role of urban biodiversity in shaping well-being remains poorly understood. This study focused on the interplay between tree genera diversity, perceived urban biodiversity, and the subjective well-being of urban residents in Karlsruhe, Germany. A map-based online questionnaire involving 302 participants investigated well-being locations and perceptions of biodiversity. Tree genera diversity was assessed for nine genera using remote-sensing and ground data. A novel approach of spatially correlating societal mapping results and tree genera cover maps revealed a clear preference for green spaces in the built-up urban environment. The relations between computed tree genera diversity and subjective well-being were unclear. However, there was a significant relationship between the perceived biodiversity of urban green spaces and subjective well-being. The amount of tree cover, the abundance of large trees, as well as the perceived species diversity beyond tree genera, lead to increased well-being of the urban population. At the same time, a perceived unkemptness of urban areas had a negative effect on the residents’ well-being. This should be considered in future research and the design of urban green spaces. © 2025 The Author(s)

AB  - Urban greenways benefit urban dwellers by providing multiple ecosystem services and by supporting biodiversity conservation in cities. Increasing competition for open space in growing cities, however, often hinders the establishment of greenways in those places where social demands for related services are highest. In the wake of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, a new greenway, the "Green Belt Berlin," is being established within the former border zone, which now links Berlin's core with the rural hinterland. An analysis of the planning approaches and principles that directed the implementation of the greenway and the transformation of vacant urban land into new parks revealed ways to (i) extend urban green infrastructure in times and places of political transformation; (ii) justify new greenspace by combining multiple ecological, social, and cultural goals within overarching planning programs; (iii) conserve and stage remnants of the Berlin Wall, allowing the greenway to become part of a decentralized memorial landscape; (iv) work with novel ecosystems and wild urban nature by integrating ecology with urban planning and design; and (v) use design interventions to create "orderly frames." Spatial analyses indicate that the new greenway may reduce environmental inequity in Berlin as it largely intersects neighborhoods where disadvantaged status coincides with poor access to urban greenspace. This case study thus demonstrates opportunities to strengthen the urban green infrastructure of growing cities through integrative planning approaches.

AB  - Although still overshadowed by environmental and economic aspects, social dimension and social acceptance play a dynamic key role in urban agriculture development. This chapter focuses on the social acceptance of urban farming in building skins and buildings, providing multiple commercial, ecological, and social benefits and essential contributors to future food security and sustainable urban development. Potential stakeholders’ needs, expectations, and preferences in terms of various aspects such as use, maintenance, and aesthetics are explored and discussed based on various farming systems, including collectively and privately organized rooftops, façades, and indoor vertical farming. User-perceived benefits and risks are discussed and used to derive critical drivers and obstacles. The chapter discusses the advantages and disadvantages of social sustainability and acceptability between different farming systems. The main results of specific, not yet numerous, but highly valuable targeted studies and practices are discussed, providing insight into consumers’ and other stakeholders’ attitudes, perceived risks, and acceptance in different parts of the world. The main insights and the proposed future directions aim to facilitate the successful adoption of farming in and on buildings as one of the strategies to promote decarbonization in buildings and cities while making them more livable and lovable. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In the face of uncertain future climate change, city policy decision-makers must choose strategies that promote climate-resilient development. Nature-based solutions (NbSs) are considered important for solving urban problems, such as carbon neutrality, improving human well-being, and enhancing biodiversity. This study aimed to examine the possibility of using ecosystem services in decision-making for the future scenarios of the city, considering land use change and climate change in combination. Representative ecosystem services of eco-friendly urban paradigms were selected, and ecosystem services and synergies were analyzed when (1) only land use change was considered, and (2) climate change (RCP 8.5) and land use change were both considered. The selected ecosystem services were analyzed using statistical and model-based methods (InVest, MaxEnt) applied to each characteristic and collectible data. The results revealed that food (rice and fishery production) was affected by land use change, recreation and leisure was affected by external activities and climate change. Carbon uptake was affected by both climate change and land use change. Regarding synergy, the amount of carbon uptake decreased by - 1.60% in BAU (S1) and increased by 24.39% in Smart Shrinkage City (S3); however, regarding recreation, the differences depended on the scenarios, such as an increase in S1 by 5.26% and an increase in S3 by 0.99%. We expect that land use change and ecosystem services can provide policymakers with quantitative information, and they can discuss priorities and alternatives.

AB  - Background: Given the increasing trend of global warming and extreme weather conditions, including heat waves and its effects on health, the present study was done to investigate adaptive behaviors of communities in the world for combating heat waves. Method: ology: In this systematic review, out of 1529 results, 57 relevant and authoritative English papers on adaptation to heat waves hazard were extracted and evaluated using valid keywords from valid databases (PubMed, WOS, EMBASE, and Scopus). In addition, multiple screening steps were done and then, the selected papers were qualitatively assessed. Evaluation results were summarized using an Extraction Table. Results: In this paper, the adaptive behaviors for combating heat waves hazard were summarized into 11 categories: Education and awareness raising, Adaptation of critical infrastructure, Governments measures, Health-related measures, Application of early warning system, Protective behaviors in workplace, Physical condition, Adaptive individual behaviors, Design and architecture of the building, Green infrastructure (green cover), and Urban design. Conclusion: The findings of this study showed that community actions have significant effects on adaptation to heat wave. Therefore, for reducing heat wave-related negative health effects and vulnerability, more attention should be paid to the above-mentioned actions for mitigation, preparation, and responding regarding heat waves.

AB  - With the increasing migration of people to urban areas, the demand for extra, fresh, and healthy food in cities has escalated manyfold. Further, anthropogenic activities, high rise buildings, and unplanned construction in urban areas are increasing urban heat. Therefore, the objective of this study is to review the salient features and constraints of urban agriculture, in addition to illustrating traditional and modern approaches, and policies used worldwide to promote the urban agriculture (UA). Urban agriculture is a key component of sustainable urban development that plays a pivotal role in combating food security and malnutrition in peri-urban and urban areas by growing different fruits, vegetables, mushrooms, herbs, flowering and ornamental plants in urban dwellings for food and aesthetic purposes. UA often combines with other functions like urban greening, biodiversity, waste recycling, environmental disaster reduction, CO2 absorption, urban heat island reduction, recreational benefits, contributing to the circular economy and UN sustainable development goals (SDGs). Plants in UA are grown in vacant open spaces, rooftops, balconies and containers, resulting in urban organic harvest by fostering income and health improvement. The concept of UA is being utilized efficiently in many countries. However, there is still a need to promote UA by arranging community gatherings and school students, creating awareness and capacity building through education and training. Growers need to be connected to land and open spaces, enhancing value addition in UA and formulating supportive policies to foster Agri-tourism in urban farms to making it a successful initiative. Recent innovative research ideas and new technological developments such as artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT), automation and mechanization in UA are opening new avenues for quality food production in urban areas for sustainable cities. © CAB International 2024.

AB  - A closer look at the built environment shows that opportunities lie in transforming buildings with nature-based solutions for fostering climate resilience. To understand the potential of buildings in contributing to transforming cities, we conducted a systematic literature review to synthesize the evidence of the provided benefits of nature-based solutions implemented on their roofs and facades. Our goal is to highlight findings about the co-benefits of nature-based solutions on buildings in real-life case studies. After systematic screening and selection, the 222 reviewed research papers support that there is confidence in the climate resilience performance and benefits green walls, green roofs, and living walls provide, contributing to heat resilience and indirectly to social-ecological justice, especially when they are installed in old buildings. Our findings show that other recorded benefits include the provision of vegetation, habitat and biodiversity enhancement, and strong evidence of water retention and purification. We also report on design characteristics of nature-based solutions which are recommended when they are implemented on buildings. Green roofs were especially well-documented and it underlines the need of more studies about diverse NBS. From the synthesis of the state of the art, we propose that further research about the design of nature-based solutions on buildings is required to extend their co-benefits to noise reduction, air pollution entrapment and filtering, and carbon sequestration. In our paper, we found that the most important knowledge gap for future research is holistic perspectives on designing NBS on buildings. © 2023

AB  - Urban green spaces (UGS) can counter the ill effects of urbanization in high-density cities. Studies related to these aspects are rare in Indian cities, however. This article aims to assess the availability and accessibility of UGS in Raipur, India. The objectives are to identify the status of UGS alteration, determine the status of available UGS, and identify the optimum population density for which UGS can be made available and accessible. Land use change detection, fragmentation index, availability index, UGS per capita, and neighborhood accessibility are used to assess aspects of UGS. The results show an increase in built-up area (24.32 percent) from 2010 to 2020. They also show a decrease in the UGS availability index and an increase in the fragmentation index from the city center to the outskirts. Uneven distribution of UGS categories is found all over the studied urban area. Low-density areas have more UGS per capita available than high-density areas, whereas medium-high-density areas have the maximum UGS accessibility. The study concludes with density-wise implications to maximize the UGS benefits and identifies medium-high density as the optimum density that allows high accessibility to the available UGS.

AB  - Incorporating ecosystem services (ESs) into spatial planning is crucial for effective environmental management and achieving sustainable development goals. While the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a commonly employed method for multicriteria analysis of ESs, it has faced criticism for its limited ability to handle inherent imprecision and uncertainties. Consequently, we proposed an assessment framework for ESs using the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and implemented it in the Shenyang Metropolitan Area (SMA), a key political and economic center in Northeast China. We quantified eight types of ESs (water yield, food supply, water regulation, carbon storage, waste regulation, soil retention, habitat quality, and outdoor recreation) within SMA. The FAHP was utilized to determine the weights of these ESs. Subsequently, we presented a normalized index to identify priority conservation and development areas. Our results indicated that the primary areas for conservation were mainly located in the southwest and east of Benxi City, the southeast of Fushun City, and the southeast of Anshan City, whereas areas for development were primarily in the northwest of Shenyang City. Through comparing various ES integration methods, our study underscores the effectiveness of FAHP in ES evaluation. The research also highlights the challenge of managing uncertainties in ES-based policy-making and emphasizes the necessity for resilient and comprehensive planning approaches. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - The increasing need to conserve the nature and biodiversity and to maintain human well-being has motivated landscape planners and researchers to seek different planning approaches in urban environments. In this context, different approaches to planning urban networks have been developed to promote the sustainable use and functioning of landscapes, to conserve the nature and species, and increase its use and enjoyment by people [1, 2]. In principle, these approaches have been founded on the conservation of natural areas/biodiversity and with a consensus on their benefits to nature, biodiversity and people [3-5]. However, they generally differ from each other with respect to their expected aims, and ecological and/or social functions [6]. Therefore, by examining different planning approaches to networks, this chapter clarifies what is meant by these concepts and approaches in the literature.

AB  - Rapid urbanization is projected for African cities at the cost of urban green space, which could jeopardize biodiversity and human benefits. Studies focusing specifically on human–green space relationships in the Global South are lacking, and the validity of extrapolating results from studies in the Global North remains questionable and cannot provide local context-specific design solutions. This study combines methods and perspectives from ecology and human geography with landscape design to better understand the benefits for biodiversity and people derived from unmanaged green spaces in the City of Tshwane, South Africa. Based on empirical data from two unmanaged green space areas in disadvantaged communities, we identify benefits for biodiversity and people and define guidelines for inclusive trans-disciplinary interventions. We combine information from a vegetation survey, a community survey of 200 respondents and a rapid assessment of multifunctional benefit provision to formulate in holistic landscape design proposals. We show that the sites have biodiversity value and provide habitat for > 169 different plant species, including protected species, and smaller wildlife. Residents use the spaces for utility, passive and active leisure, and > 76% of residents benefit from the use of these spaces. However, the integrity and provision of benefits from green spaces are threatened by pollution, safety concerns, biological invasions, and land conversion. Context-specific designs could be developed by merging methods across disciplines and involving local stakeholders to integrate the multifunctionality of socioecological benefits into landscape interventions. Collaboration across ecology, human geography and landscape design generates multifunctional perspectives of unmanaged green spaces that consider benefits for biodiversity and disadvantaged communities. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The present study determined the community characteristics, structural composition, and regeneration status of street trees in two major Indian cities viz., Ranchi and Delhi. A total of 96 species of 86 genera belonging to 34 families were documented in the urban streets of Ranchi (of which 59 spp. were in the IUCN Red-list), while 64 species of 56 genera belonging to 28 families (of which 47 spp. were in the IUCN Red-list) were reported in Delhi. The study reported a very high species diversity index (H′) in both Ranchi (3.98) and Delhi (3.47), with similar species evenness (0.85). Fabaceae and Ficus were the predominant family and genus, respectively in both cities. The similarity of street trees of Ranchi and Delhi is quite low in terms of all the β-diversity indices (SI = 38.75% and dissimilarity = 61.25%; Cj = 0.24 and dissimilarity = 0.76; BCij = 0.61 and similarity = 0.39). The total street tree density in Ranchi (217 ind. ha−1) and Delhi (637 ind. ha−1) varied significantly, while the dominance (basal area) of both cities were quite similar (20.67 m2ha−1 and 21.70 m2ha−1) due to the predominance of young and adult individuals (GBH ≥30–90 cm) in the street tree community at Ranchi and pole and young individuals (GBH ≥ 10–60) in Delhi. The regeneration potential of street trees in both cities was quite concerning because the majority of street trees at Ranchi (62.5% of 96 spp.) and Delhi (57.38% of 64 spp.) had shown no regeneration. It is advised that re-greening, planting a variety of native tree tracts in urban niches, and tree planting in a ratio of one to three be implemented to counteract artificial urban land, maintain urban biodiversity and achieve UN SDGs. © 2024 Ecological Society of China

AB  - Community gardens are often positioned as spaces where urban people can build community, reclaim common space, and reassert a "right to the city" in urban landscapes that are shaped by gentrification and the privatization of space. However, the literature on urban agriculture often focuses on the struggles of gardens to endure external political-economic processes, largely overlooking within-garden tensions relating to social inequality and resource access. In this study we examined how the pressures associated with urbanization are inscribed in three community garden landscapes in the central coast of California a region undergoing massive urban transformation in recent decades. The cases reveal that social tensions from urbanization permeate garden boundaries to influence the production of space and the social relations within the garden. Specifically, the resource struggles and social inequities in these regions are made visible in the gardens through conflicts over membership rules, resource management, and theft of produce. The analysis of these conflicts illustrates how extreme real estate valuation and gentrification shapes the particular ways in which the urban commons are managed, including the forms of inclusion and exclusion, claims-making, and racialization of resources that are employed. Uncovering and complicating our understanding of the struggles of and tensions within community gardens is a necessary step in the pursuit of "just sustainability" within changing cityscapes.

AB  - Globally people devote approximately 90% of their time indoors either in their house or office or institution, etc. Together with the dispersion of outdoor air pollutants, toxins are produced in indoor atmosphere owing to various actions such as heating, cooking, cooling and emissions from building materials. Hence, the indoor air quality (IAQ) influences human well-being and efficiency. Even though indoor air quality (IAQ) research has been done from various outlooks, there is still an absence of inclusive assessment of peer reviewed IAQ studies, which precisely covers the IAQ in rural and urban environment helping to recognize the sources and consequences in both the environment, respectively. Therefore, this review article of scientific studies offers a broad spectrum of pollutants identified in both rural and urban indoor environments in context to India, highlighting the technical interventions, modelling techniques and remedies such as HEPA filters, carbon filters, bioremediation etc. in course of improving IAQ. This review also elucidates the chemistry of pollutants along with general chemical reactions between pollutants. Thus, this review paper holds the potential to help building professionals and researchers in the field for regulating indoor air quality and generate healthy and sustainable indoor environment. © This is an open access journal, and articles are distributed under the terms of the Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) License.

AB  - Pluvial floods can exert significant pressure on urban sustainability and human wellbeing during rapid urbanization. Rapid urbanization and exacerbated flooding have stimulated investigations of green land's role in mitigating urban flooding in China. The newly applied "Sponge City" plan considers the concave green land (CGL) as an effective tool in mitigating pluvial floods. However, its capacity and beneficiaries still need to be elucidated. This paper fills this research gap by integrating urban flood simulation, scenario analysis, and mitigation assessment in central Shanghai, China. It reveals that CGL could not only mitigate direct runoff and inundation, but also reduce population exposure and enhance community resilience. CGL with a depth of 0.10-0.20 m can mitigate direct runoffs by 23.63-98.35% and inundation extents by 26.09-82.41%, resulting in a slide of the exposed urban population by 0.40-1.04 million persons and the exposed elders by 0.04-0.12 million persons. Moreover, the effectiveness of CGL varies spatially implying for a sound spatial planning of CGLs and a potential combination with other flood mitigation measures. These findings could help cities particularly in developing countries to adapt to rising pluvial flooding through urban planning and nature-based flood mitigation measures.

AB  - Urban agriculture is often associated with sustainable agricultural practices. However, the variety of systems qualifying as urban agriculture and the limited information available about their sustainability question this direct relationship. To better understand differences in intra-urban agriculture systems and their sustainability, this paper proposed an holistic classification of urban agricultural systems and collected knowledge about the environmental, social, and economic sustainability of these systems. Such a classification is important to evaluate sustainability claims on urban agricultural systems, anticipate potential sustainability trade-offs between urban agricultural systems and propose preventive measures to address these, and ultimately guide the sustainable deployment of these systems. Compared with existing classifications, the novel classification scheme proposed here accounts for technological, social and economic characteristics of urban agriculture systems to better distinguish between all systems. It was built on 91 scientific papers. The economic intensity of production was, for example, an important characteristic to coherently group urban agriculture systems. The intensity of cooperation between all actors was another characteristic emphasized for certain urban agriculture systems. One end of the classification scheme describes ground-based open, socially motivated urban agriculture systems with high cooperation intensity and low production intensity. The other end of the classification scheme describes building-integrated quasi-closed systems with high production intensity. In between, we find: building-integrated conditioned systems, ground-based conditioned systems, and building-integrated open systems. Mapping sustainability claims from literature in the classification scheme supported its definition along the three characteristics. For example, urban farming was associated with job creation, food safety, water savings, and higher yields while urban gardening with educational potentials, biodiversity improvements, and lower yields. Their display in the classification scheme was therefore supported. To further support the use of the proposed scheme, additional quantitative research to better understand and quantify the sustainability of urban agriculture systems is required. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - In an increasingly anthropogenic world, urban green areas are critical for human well-being because of the ecosystem services they offer. However, the management of these areas often prioritizes economic, architectural, and esthetic needs over ecological functionality, undermining the benefits they ought to provide. Actions to restore the functional ecological processes of urban green areas have thus become increasingly urgent. This study investigated the impact of urban green area characteristics on the community composition of an indicator animal group to inform Nature-Based Solutions (NBSs) for urban biodiversity and sustainability enhancement. We analyzed data on small mammal community composition from three Italian metropolitan cities (Milan, Florence, and Rome), focusing on the distribution pattern of synanthropic and non-synanthropic species. Small mammal surveys were carried out using hair tubes in sampled areas located along a gradient of green area size and fragmentation. Multiple Linear Mixed Models assessed the influence of spatial and habitat green area characteristics on species richness. Synanthropic species richness was positively associated with manicured urban parks, while non-synanthropic species richness was higher in woodland green areas characterized by high shrub cover. Through a Linear Mixed Model and NODF-based Nestedness analyses, we found that competitive exclusion and selective extinction/colonization processes did not significantly influence community composition. These insights emphasize the major influence of habitat composition in supporting functional communities of urban small mammals. To move toward resilient urban ecosystems, NBSs must primarily be implemented at a local scale by creating green patches with high habitat quality, and secondarily, they should be embedded in an interconnected and functional network at a city scale.

AB  - Green Infrastructure (GI), such as rain gardens, trees or permeable pavement, can provide several ecosystem services, protect biodiversity and mitigate the impacts of climate change in urban settings. Using a combination of public surveys and interviews with experts, this research evaluates opportunities and constraints for GI to add value and assist place-making in public realm developments, which is of relevance to impact assessment. The research uses the unique Woodside area in Glasgow as a case study. The project, 'Connecting Woodside', is a first of its kind in Scotland and lessons learned can be applied elsewhere. The study found that, to effectively utilise GI to assist place-making and add value in public realm developments, community engagement is a key aspect in developing public spaces. One of the main reasons identified for this was that GI was highly location specific. Therefore, it is important to understand the needs and wants of a place and its communities. The study demonstrated that community ownership of certain project aspects relating to GI could be beneficial for all stakeholders.

AB  - Land use and land cover largely determine the ecosystem functions that can occur, where they occur, and the organisms that enable those. The composition and configuration patterns of land use and land cover will impact urban biodiversity; therefore how we recognize and understand those patterns is relevant towards planning to enhance biodiversity in urban ecosystems. This chapter addresses the past, present, and future of land use and land cover in urban areas by covering three main sections: The history of land use/land cover in urban areas, how biodiversity connects to land use/land cover under a landscape ecology framework, and how planning for sustainability and fulfilment of sustainable development goals can be done by addressing urban biodiversity at a landscape scale. Through concepts, examples, and tools, we expect readers to become immersed in the importance of land use/land cover configuration and composition for urban biodiversity and related ecological processes. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Charles H.

AB  - The composition and diversity of urban forests are gaining attention in scholarly research, urban development, and sustainability efforts. Despite their critical ecosystem services, literature on urban forests remains limited, especially in developing countries like Burkina Faso. This study examines the urban area of Dedougou, assessing species composition, diversity, and structural characteristics across different land-use and land-cover (LULC) types. Botanical investigations were conducted in five of the city's six sectors, covering administrative, school, residential, and roadside areas. Data, including species, origin, height, and diameter at breast height, were collected from 47 plots (50 m x 50 m) in administrative, school, and residential areas, and 17 plots (50 m x 20 m) along roadsides. A total of 71 species, distributed across 57 genera and 31 families, were identified. Among these, 57% were exotic, 51% were edible, 89% had medicinal properties, and 37% served ornamental purposes. The Shannon diversity index averaged 2.2 +/- 0.8. No significant difference was observed in the distribution of exotic and native species across various LULC types. Residential areas exhibited the highest species richness, with 36 exotic and 30 native species, while roadsides had the lowest, featuring ten exotic and eight native species. The findings have implications for United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goals 11, 13, and 15. The study concludes that Dedougou's urban forests are diverse in woody species, particularly in residential areas. This research adds new insights into the floristic diversity and structural characteristics of urban areas in Burkina Faso, offering valuable information for future urban planning and management.

AB  - Biodiversity sustains human civilisation as it is intricately related to the supply of all the ecosystem services that underscore human well-being. The connotation ‘human well - being’ denotes amongst other things ‘security’ that entails security to ‘resource access’ and ‘adequate livelihoods’- as basic materials for a good life. However, the benefits of growth and development accruing from our natural resources need to be distributed equitably amongst the ‘people’ without damaging the ‘ecological health of the planet’ to achieve the goals of the sustainable development (2015) at the global level. Though cities are proficient means of spatial organisation that provide shelter and livelihood to a large number of people and have developed into foci of innovations and economic growth they have been inept of taking care of nature due to their exhaustive and unsustainable consumption pattern. They are intense hubs of energy and material consumption that emanates massive wastes damaging environmental health and, in turn, biodiversity. The answer to this dilemma lies in the Mainstreaming Biodiversity into the city planning and management which will balance biodiversity and development. Mainstreaming or including biodiversity into urban planning is imperative as cities draw numerous ecosystem services at local, regional and global scales. However, this expression ‘mainstreaming’ warrants a clear understanding of the jargon itself and the instruments that will enable integration of the same. In this paper, an attempt has been made to explore the diverse instruments that are available at the global, national, subnational and local levels for biodiversity conservation and management and urban planning processes. The idea is to explore the interface that exists between the instruments of the two spheres and create a convergence between the processes of urban planning and biodiversity conservation. © 2020, Bentham Books imprint.

AB  - Growth and development of an urban area modifies and creates biodiversity, which has a vital role in maintaining and improving the quality of the urban environment. The paper studies the growth and development of Delhi, the capital city of India, and outlines an approach to assess the biodiversity pattern of the metropolis. The co-relation between habitat scales and levels of planning to arrive at a biodiversity profile of an urban area, are explained. The Global Biodiversity Assessment and Convention on Biological Diversity has brought forth the need to conserve biodiversity at global and local levels. Because of their diminishing numbers, the role of species in urban areas has become critical. So far, in cities, open spaces are supposed to mainly cater to aesthetic demands and recreation needs. But if we examine the environmental role they play—pollution abatement, water recharge, indicator of pollution, climatic amelioration, flood control and so on—they are many. The strategy for conservation is related to the scale of habitat, thus a multiscale strategy for conservation is explained in detail. The legal, governance and policy tools in India relating to national, sub-national and local levels are put forth to give a holistic picture of the various aspects to be considered for mainstreaming biodiversity conservation in the urban planning process. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2018.

AB  - In this chapter we take a complex systems approach to exploring the linkages among the phenomenon of urbanization, the changing value systems and world perspectives of urban dwellers, the sometimes distant connections to the food production systems that support cities, and the often invisible ecosystem services that support food production and in turn are affected by food production. After we explore the relationship between a range of ecosystem services and their relationship to food production, we present three cases of economically developed cities that secure their food from global sources. The wealthy urban populations in all our three case cities adhere to the highly commoditized systems of industrial production based on energy- and material-intensive external inputs for the bulk of their food provision. Fully integrated into the global market, trade enables these cities to both consume and produce what their consumers desire without regard to the local capacity of ecosystems in the regions around the cities. Although each city is secure under prevailing economic and trade conditions, they are exposed to a range of socio-economic and ecosystem vulnerabilities that arise from the conventional “productivist” food production paradigm upon which they are based. We conclude by proposing a number of scenarios describing plausible trajectories for the evolution of food systems in the twenty-fi rst century as humanity becomes increasingly urbanized. Fundamentally, the ecologically integrated system approach, especially the urban garden component, would go a long way towards reconnecting urban dwellers with the biosphere, with potential positive effects on biodiversity. © 2013, Springer Netherlands.

AB  - Common approaches tomapping green infrastructure in urbanised landscapes invariably focus on measures of land use or land cover and associated functional or physical traits. However, such onedimensional perspectives do not accurately capture the character and complexity of the landscapes in which urban inhabitants live. The new approach presented in this paper demonstrates how open-source, high spatial and temporal resolution data with global coverage can be used tomeasure and represent the landscape qualities of urban environments. Through going beyond simple metrics of quantity, such as percentage green and blue cover, it is now possible to explore the extent to which landscape quality helps to unpick the mixed evidence presented in the literature on the benefits of urban nature to human well-being. Here we present a landscape approach, employing remote sensing, GIS and data reduction techniques to map urban green infrastructure elements in a large U.K. city region. Comparison with existing urban datasets demonstrates considerable improvement in terms of coverage and thematic detail. The characterisation of landscapes, using census tracts as spatial units, and subsequent exploration of associations with social-ecological attributes highlights the further detail that can be uncovered by the approach. For example, eight urban landscape types identified for the case study city exhibited associations with distinct socioeconomic conditions accountable not only to quantities but also qualities of green and blue space. The identification of individual landscape features through simultaneous measures of land use and land cover demonstrated unique and significant associations between the former and indicators of human health and ecological condition. The approach may therefore provide a promising basis for developing further insight into processes and characteristics that affect human health and well-being in urban areas, both in the United Kingdom and beyond.

AB  - Financial development supports economic growth, reduces unemployment, ensures justice, and has an impact on the environment. Human development significantly supports E-7 countries in achieving the goal of stable and qualified economic development in the next decade. This factor affects people’s ability to manage environmental problems and increases their productivity by contributing to people’s industrial and production processes. It can be a guide for states to choose technologies that take into account the clean environment and increase energy efficiency in areas where energy is constantly used. Increasing urbanization encourages various development activities. This study aims to investigate the impact of financial development, human development, urbanization, and industrial employment on environmental quality for E-7 countries with regularized common correlated effects and the Augmented Mean Group long-run estimators. Another important aim of the study is to achieve Sustainable Development Goals 4, 8, 9, 11 and 13. Increasing financial development improves environmental quality in Russia and India, according to robust results from long-run estimators. Increasing human development in China increases environmental pollution. While the expansion of urbanization increases environmental quality in Brazil, it decreases it in China. The increase in employment in the industry increases the load capacity factor in the panel group, Brazil, China, Indonesia, and India. In addition to these results, the current article presents policy recommendations for governments to increase environmental quality on a country basis and provides feasible solutions on how to use the independent variables in the study as environmental tools. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The paper examines the relationship between city and environment, assuming that contemporary urbanism and sustainability of urban environment do not dialogue. To this end, from analysis of urban biodiversity, cultural ecosystem services, urban design, biophilia and configurational accessibility, a sample of 21 medium-sized Brazilian cities is investigated. Methodology is structured in two sections: (a) categorization of settlements according to biodiversity potential; and (b) spatial analysis of cultural ecosystem services (CES) to verify human access. Results indicate that investigated settlements present: (i) urbanization advancing through vegetation areas, extensive agricultural areas and patches of tree vegetation, low presence of parks, squares and protected areas; (ii) high to medium potential for biodiversity, using this potential for ecosystem services of provisioning and regulation and; (iii) satisfactory levels of access to cultural ecosystem services that reflect human access to nature. In addition, it was found that the CES are located, based on Space Syntax, in potentially accessible urban areas with potential for social interaction. © 2022 Proceedings 13th International Space Syntax Symposium, SSS 2022.

AB  - Increasing anthropogenic intervention within the terrestrial environment has perturbed the cycling of major nutrients, such as carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) with detrimental effects on climate, biodiversity and the ability for ecosystems to supply fundamental services for human health and sustainable economic growth. Controlling diffuse pollutants from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere and receiving waters is paramount for maintaining the integrity of multi-functional landscapes and protecting the wider environment. Utilising four typical land use categories (uplands, woodlands, agriculture: grassland/cropland), we discuss sources and the qualitative risk of diffuse pollutant production that impacts on air and water quality. Integrated diffuse pollution research that combines gaseous, dissolved and solid (particulate) physical phases is essential for understanding inter-relationships between different pollutant fates, and preventing unintentional pollutant swapping. Future research and awareness should focus on mitigation measures that achieve multiple benefits and minimal disbenefits with respect to diffuse pollution, whilst considering other ecosystem service sectors. Where evidence of benefits can be proven, these can be incorporated within an integrated catchment approach to environmental management and planning. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In-situ live mulch crops such as watermelon can reduce soil temperature, improve soil moisture, and provide additional income for food security in mixed cropping systems. These investigations quantify the impact of in-situ watermelon live mulch densities on yield potential, climatic change adaptation capability and food security strategies in tropical urban amaranth production systems. Imposed were 3 sowing densities of watermelon: 1.5x0.45 m; 1.5x0.90 m; 1.5x1.50 m. Grain amaranth was transplanted at 0.75x0.75 m spacing in an RCB design. Averaged over 2 consecutive cropping's, amaranth grain and watermelon yields were significantly highest at 1.5x0.90 m watermelon plant spacing density optimum for yield potential, climate change adaptability and food security resilient strategy. This corresponded to the reduction in maximum soil temperature of 2 degrees C by amaranth and 3.5 degrees C by watermelon compared to the control without mulch. There was a check plot without amaranth and watermelon but weeds monitored. Soil moisture content was significantly (P=0.05) conserved in the live mulch treatments by 18.2% compared to the bare not mulched soil control of 14%. This research demonstrates that live mulch is useful in rainwater conservation and reduced temperature; and we believe offers opportunities for food security, carbon sequestration and landscape restoration in the humid tropics of sub Saharan Africa countries under rain-fed agriculture climate change scenarios.

AB  - Urban ecosystem services have become a main issue in contemporary urban sustainable development, whose efforts are challenged by the phenomena of world urbanization and climate change. This article presents a study about the ecosystem services of green infrastructure towards better respiratory health in a socioeconomic scenario typical of the Global South countries. The study involved a data science approach comprising basic and multivariate statistical analysis, as well as data mining, for the municipalities of the state of Paraná, in Brazil’s South region. It is a cross-sectional study in which multiple data sets are combined and analyzed to uncover relationships or patterns. Data were extracted from national public domain databases. We found that, on average, the municipalities with more area of biodiversity per inhabitant have lower rates of hospitalizations resulting from respiratory diseases (CID-10 X). The biodiversity index correlates inversely with the rates of hospitalizations. The data analysis also demonstrated the importance of socioeconomic issues in the environmental-respiratory health phenomena. The data mining analysis revealed interesting associative rules consistent with the learning from the basic statistics and multivariate analysis. Our findings suggest that green infrastructure provides ecosystem services towards better respiratory health, but these are entwined with socioeconomics issues. These results can support public policies towards environmental and health sustainable management. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The concentration of large populations in metropolitan areas is a great matter of interest in the field of public health, especially in developing countries. Although the metropolization process is considered a worldwide phenomenon, this trend is accentuated in low and medium income countries considered as emerging countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America. In the process of metropolization, irreversible impacts were observed on the natural environment, including with respect to pressures on environmental services. In this chapter, the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo in São Paulo (Brazil) is the object of study focused on the analysis of the occupation of watershed protection areas, which provide environmental services and social inequalities, which may be relevant in the context of violence, reflected as a matter of public and environmental health. We used data from Brazilian public institutions, allowing verifying the relations between inequalities in socioeconomic and environmental health of the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo (MRSP), state of São Paulo, Brazil. We applied a critical analysis to contextualize the 39 municipalities' components of the MRSP with about 20 million inhabitants. The city of São Paulo has a forceful representation as headquarters of the metropolis, with 11.253.503 inhabitants in 2010 with GDP of R$ 389 billion and GDP/capita of R$ 35,271.9 in 2009.As for this economic indicator, we note that the inequality is large, ranging from the highest in the city of Barueri with the lowest R$ 99,595.7 in Francisco Morato with R$ 5,492.6 in 2009. However, the environmental and health inequalities are presented in forms of spatialization with the economic disparities. Thus, under the condition of relevant environmental services providers, we focus the discussion on distinct patterns of inequalities that occur in municipalities with a significant portion of the watershed protection area, providing water to the city of São Paulo. In this condition, exploring the aspect of violence as an important indicator of public health, we observed an increase in the rate of homicides in Mairiporã with 49.9 in 2001 to 53.1 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2009 and Juquitiba with 36.7 in 2001 to 68.2 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2009, while Francisco Morato (45.9 in 2001 to 21.6 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2009) and Taboão Serra (84.6 in 2001 to 19.4 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2009). The urban segregation and social exclusion can be considered as some of the factors associated with increased violence. Concluding Remarks, the watershed areas in MRSP can be considered the most fragile areas by the presence of remnants of green areas, are providers of ecosystem services and suppliers of water to metropolis, and where overlapping social inequities as the areas of greatest violence and environmental degradation. It can be inferred that the environmental and social problems such as violence and inequities in watershed areas can be compounded with the possible exacerbation of climate phenomena. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - As residential, commercial, and industrial developments continue to erode the integrity of natural areas, public interest in interactions between ecological and economic systems has intensified. This interest registers in frequently contentious debates about the validity of goals to preserve natural areas and the efficiency and the equity properties of the means to do so. Arguably this same public has denied the goals of environmental protection more frequently than necessary because regulatory authorities have used unnecessarily costly means of implementation.1 The devices used to implement the goals of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) seem a prime example of those means of implementation. Only the most insensitive, strictly urban beings would dare assert in polite company that it is not good in principle to protect the earth's non-urban life-forms and the habitats in which they live. Witness the consistently high standing in polls that the public gives the generic concept of environmental protection, including habitat conservation. The rub appears to be in how to implement the ESA and whether its goals are always feasible, have been made too costly by perverse bureaucratic rigidities and complexities, or are simply feel-good expressions. Much of the land to which the ESA is meant to apply is privately owned. Some threatened or endangered species currently exist only on private land held in multiple ownerships. Suggestions and actual attempts to make implementation of the ESA more flexible and more predictable and less costly for private owners than can be achieved by simply issuing management injunctions to them from on high have not been lacking. Incidental take permits in which development is allowed if a landowner can show that it will not lead to species extinction are granted by the ESA authority. Safe harbor plans in which federal authorities and landowners negotiate no-fault contracts, where owners are not liable for harm to a species if they manage their land in accordance with contract terms, are now sometimes used by federal authorities (Turner and Rylander 1998). Economists and those who now and then listen to economists have proposed variants of tradable effluent permit allocation instruments (Crocker 1966; D. Montgomery 1972), such as tradable habitat preservation credits (Merrifield 1995) and tradable development rights (Stavins 1989). The flexibility and predictability these devices purportedly offer owners have, however, been met with skepticism by occasional commentators, including even some economists. Frey et al. (1996) worry that marketlike instruments will reduce the demand for and crowd out environmental virtue (morality). But virtuous attitudes and the social norms that manifest them can breed disrespect when they ask for more than people can accomplish. Boyd et al. (1999) center their criticisms on the costs of designing site-specific contracts, claims, or rights, owner by owner. Granted, the complexity of designing an ecologically and economically sound system of permits, claims, or rights to develop sites can be daunting. This is an inadequate reason, however, to dismiss out of hand such systems when the only recognized alternative to them is a command-and-control system of questionable virtue in which middle-level bureaucrats and biological technicians are given free rein to designate restricted development sites and to redistribute wealth while using little more than biological criteria to do so. Given that society values natural habitats and the varied organisms that enjoy them, economic efficiency decrees that private landowners be held accountable for the effects their activities have on the socially valued dimensions of these habitats. Nevertheless, accountability must be achieved at the least cost to landowners and to the rest of society if the public is to ungrudgingly accept the ESA. The next section argues that substantial scope exists for the use of tradable permits or credits in habitat conservation efforts. It also compares the economic efficiency and the wealth distribution features of tradable credit schemes to command-and-control schemes. A third section forms the core of the essay. It argues (and, for stylized conditions, formally demonstrates in an appendix) that neither tradable credit systems alone nor wealth redistributing command-and-control systems alone are capable of providing the flexibility and predictability that a socially least-cost design for habitat protection requires. Least-cost designs will initially involve private landowners in a tradable habitat credit system and, subsequently, in a transfer payment, command-and-control exercise operated by a central authority. Contrary to the standard perception that tradable permits or credits and environmental use taxes or subsidies are substitute policy instruments, this chapter suggests that they can be complements. They can reinforce each other's strengths while sidestepping their weaknesses. The fourth section comments on the practical issues likely to be involved in implementing such a hybrid scheme of economic incentives and regulation, with particular attention to the relevance to outcomes of the accuracy of information about habitat attributes and its division between landowners and the regulating authority. In conclusion, I argue that the hybrid scheme is worthy of serious consideration. Circumstances are likely to be plentiful on multiple-ownership private lands where the scheme can achieve public habitat conservation goals in a flexible, predictable, efficient, and equitable fashion. © 2005 by The University of Texas Press.

AB  - Nature -based solutions (NbS) offer pathways towards climate resilient development. For cities, these pathways translate to a host of benefits to address the climate crisis, including climate change adaptation and mitigation, biodiversity protection and enhancement, and human well-being. In urban spaces, NbS are also about the design and re -design of the urban built and natural environment. This presents a need to create the institutions and governance mechanisms that allow for the co -production and co -design of NbS alongside local communities in ways that serve to address justice and legacies of inequality. In this perspective, I examine three areas of focus to deliver just nature -based solutions: problem , process , and progress . Problem focuses on the types of relationships nature -based solutions seek to transform -the race and class -based inequalities embedded in urban form. Process addresses how nature -based solutions can deliver justice through design and co -production. Finally, progress is about developing indicators and measuring progress towards achieving just nature -based solutions and how they reflect diverse and pluralistic value systems. Collectively these should move just NbS towards the repair of social and ecological exploitation in and beyond the city.

AB  - Decades of research on multifunctional Green Infrastructure (GI) has yet to translate into holistic implementation in the built environment. This oversight stems from assumptions that many ecosystem services occur passively and thus potential synergies are overlooked during planning and design. This study offers specific guidance for coordinating GI planning, design, and construction by examining the current state of academic literature on these aspects. It identifies 15 GI elements (e.g., green roofs) and 15 objectives (e.g., biodiversity) to collectively consider before implementation. The literature tends to isolate discussions of “engineered” GI elements with water-related objectives, while more “natural” GI are linked to biodiversity and human well-being. Coordinating across GI objectives and elements remains imperative, but evaluating too many options risks a paradox of choice. This study recommends short-term adherence to principles of adaptive design and, in the long-term, reemphasizes multifunctionality assessments, inter and transdisciplinary collaboration, and political will. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The gap between scientific knowledge and implementation in the fields of biodiversity conservation, environmental management, and climate change adaptation has resulted in many calls from practitioners and academics to provide practical solutions responding effectively to the risks and opportunities of global environmental change, e.g., Future Earth. We present a framework to guide the implementation of science-action partnerships based on a real-world case study of a partnership between a local municipality and an academic institution to bridge the science-action gap in the eThekwini Municipal Area, South Africa. This partnership aims to inform the implementation of sustainable land-use planning, biodiversity conservation, environmental management, and climate change adaptation practice and contributes to the development of human capacity in these areas of expertise. Using a transdisciplinary approach, implementation-driven research is being conducted to develop several decision-making products to better inform land-use planning and management. Lessons learned through this partnership are synthesized and presented as a framework of enabling actions operating at different levels, from the individual to the interorganizational. Enabling actions include putting in place enabling organizational preconditions, assembling a functional well-structured team, and actively building interpersonal and individual collaborative capacity. Lessons learned in the case study emphasize the importance of building collaborative capacity and social capital, and paying attention to the process of transdisciplinary research to achieve more tangible science, management, and policy objectives in science-action partnerships. By documenting and reflecting on the process, this case study provides conceptual and practical guidance on bridging the science-action gap through partnerships. © 2016 by the author(s).

AB  - The urban nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) cycles are substantially influenced by human activity. Alterations to these cycles include increased inputs from fossil fuel combustion and fertilizer use. The leaf chemistry of urban trees can be used to distinguish between these different N and C sources. Here, we evaluated relationships between urban vegetation and different N and C sources in street and residential trees in the Salt Lake Valley, Utah. We tested three hypotheses: 1) unfertilized street trees on high traffic density roads will have higher leaf %N, more enriched δ15N and more depleted δ13C than unfertilized street trees on low traffic density roads; 2) trees in high income residential neighborhoods will have higher leaf %N, more depleted δ15N and more enriched δ13C than trees in lower income neighborhoods; and 3) unfertilized street trees will have lower leaf %N, more enriched δ15N and more depleted δ13C than fertilized residential trees. Leaf δ15N was more enriched near high traffic density roads for one study species. However, street tree δ15N and δ13C were largely influenced by vehicle emissions from primary and secondary roads within 1000 m radius rather than the immediately adjacent road. Leaf δ13C was correlated with neighborhood income, although this relationship may be the result of variations in irrigation practices rather than variations in C sources. Finally, unfertilized trees in downtown Salt Lake had lower leaf %N, more enriched δ15N and more depleted δ13C than fertilized trees. These results highlight that urban trees can serve as biomonitors of the environment. Moreover, they emphasize that roads can have large spatial footprints and that the leaf chemistry of urban vegetation may be influenced by the spatial patterns in roads and road densities at the landscape scale. This study highlights that vehicle emissions and fertilizer have isotopically distinct influences on urban foliage. It also underscores that dense urban roads have a large spatial footprint. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Context Urban community gardens are globally prevalent urban agricultural areas and have the potential to fulfill human needs in impoverished neighborhoods, such as food security and access to open space. Despite these benefits, little research has been conducted evaluating environmental and socioeconomic factors influencing community garden plant biodiversity and ecosystem services (ES). Objective Our study investigated the drivers of managed plant richness, abundance, and ES production in community gardens across Los Angeles County, CA from 2010 to 2012 at regional, garden, and plot scales. Methods Fourteen community gardens were visited in the summers of 2010-2012 for comprehensive species surveys across regional, garden, and plot scales. We compared biodiversity to household income, plot size, and gardener ethnicity. Results In total, 707 managed plant species were recorded in summer surveys over a 3-year period. Ornamental plant richness increased with neighborhood income, while edible and medicinal richness increased with size of garden plots. Gardener ethnicity also influenced the composition of managed species, especially edible species. Conclusions We explain these patterns through a hierarchy of needs framework; gardeners preferentially plant species progressively less connected to human need. Ornamental plant increases in high-income regions may be explained by their requirement for financial investment and maintenance time. Cultural and provisioning ES are important for immigrant populations, resulting in ethnically distinct crop assemblages. Finally, distinct species-area relationships imply high demand for food abundance and biodiversity. Our quantitative results indicate that community gardens contribute to a biologically diverse urban ecosystem and provide valued ecosystem services in food insecure regions.

AB  - INTRODUCTION Urban areas require stormwater management. Recently there has been a movement towards more nature-based, green infrastructure approaches for managing stormwater. These systems have also demonstrated additional ecosystem benefits much needed in urban areas. At the same time, decades of research support the need for access to nature for healthy childhood development. Designing and locating nature-based stormwater systems where children frequent renders systems as multifunctional spaces, providing synergetic opportunities, which benefit individuals and communities. Challenges to integrating these spaces include safety, cost, and management, all of which can be overcome by smart and appropriate design. Such design requires collaboration between different skillsets and stakeholders through some minimal, but essential changes in the consultation and design process. Ultimately, integrating nature-based stormwater practices into children’s outdoor spaces will provide economic, environmental, and social benefits to urban areas. © 2015, College Publishing.

AB  - Addressing global uneven urban development and the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions (CE), this study presents a new method for calculating urban socioeconomic development indexes using a variety of data sources. Using the Yangtze River Delta as an example, we categorize urban areas into core, transitional, and peripheral cities. With the help of extended Kaya-index decomposition models, we evaluate the effects of regional industrial growth, consumer markets, and spatial expansion on urban CE. The research explores differences in CE drivers across and within these city categories. Our findings reveal that in core cities, 31.5 % of CE is due to the industrial structure and 14.9 % due to population density. In transitional cities, CE increases by 60.22 % primarily due to industrial structure and consumer consumption. Peripheral cities, on the other hand, have a complex set of causes for CE, with per capita living, spatial expansion, population size, urbanization, and consumption limitation contributing to 91.97 %, 10.73 %, 14.2 %, 9.34 %, and 24.92 % of CE respectively. Varied factors influence CE intensity differences within each city group. Cleaner production technologies and potential carbon reductions in consumption and industry are identified as key strategies for compensating CE reduction. We propose the adoption of carbon function zoning in urban clusters to leverage the role of carbon function in each area. Territorial spatial planning should ensure a balanced layout of production, living, and ecological functions. Residents' consumption, being the key factor driving CE, must transition toward green, low-carbon consumption, reinforced by societal norms and responsibilities. This research provides valuable theoretical and practical insights into urban classification and CE reduction strategies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Urban green spaces provide a host of ecosystem services, the quantity and structure of which play an important role in human well-being. Rapid urbanization may modify urban green spaces, having various effects on plant diversity. Tropical coastal cities have urbanized rapidly in recent decades, but few studies have been conducted with a focus on their green spaces. We studied the responses of cultivated and spontaneous plants, both key components of urban flora, to the landscape structure of urban green spaces and possible social drivers. We analyzed existing relationships between plant diversity indices, urban green space landscape metrics (using Systeme Probatoire d'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) data,), and social factors, including the type, population density, construction age, and GPS coordinates of each Urban Functional Unit, or UFU. We found that UFUs with more green space patches had higher cultivated and spontaneous species richness than those with fewer green space patches. Spontaneous species richness decreased when green space patches became fragmented, and it increased when green space patches were more connected (e.g., via land bridges). Conversely, cultivated species richness increased with green space patch fragmentation. The phylogenetic diversity of both cultivated and spontaneous plants were weakly associated with green space structure, which was strongly driven by land use. Old UFUs and those with larger populations had more green space patches overall, although they tended to be small and fragmented. Green space patch density was found to increase as the UFU age increased. From the viewpoint of knowledge transfer, understanding the effects and drivers of landscape patterns of urban green spaces could inform the development of improved policies and management of urban green space areas.

The case study leads to a demonstration of a symbiosis embedded in a building-scale food-energy-water (FEW) nexus. Three scenarios are compared in terms of their carbon footprint, water footprint, and ecological footprint. SDM can fully support the assessment of scenarios proposed in a FEW nexus via carbon, water, and ecological footprints. Urban agriculture can improve not only the food security but also save carbon footprint if the long-distance food distribution is required in a metropolitan region. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The contribution of community-based initiatives towards sustainability transitions is of growing interest. However, systematic, quantitative, and comparative assessments of their potential impact across different environmental, social, and economic dimensions are scarce. In this paper, we present a multi-dimensional assessment of 37 initiatives grouped in the following typologies: community gardens, solidarity purchasing groups, food cooperatives, community energy, recycling, and mobility initiatives. We provide evidence of the capacity of community-based sustainability initiatives to promote effective and efficient low-carbon solutions, social capital and inclusion, human capital, economic impact, and innovation. We show that, thanks in particular to their environmental effects, community energy initiatives are the best performing, although their social impact is weak. The opposite is true for community gardens. Mobility and recycling initiatives rank lower but can obtain meaningful impacts if they engage intensively within their communities. Food cooperatives and purchasing groups have the weakest effects. However, we show that results for individual initiatives are variable—indicating that the specific activities undertaken are less important than how they are conducted. Moreover, the best-performing initiatives are usually active in more than one typology, showing that diversification is an asset. We also show some interesting correlations between the degree of diversity of participants that initiatives can attract, their propensity to diffuse knowledge, and their creativity in finding carbon-efficient solutions. Finally, top-ranked initiatives overall rarely appear at the top of any separate assessment criterion: the possibility of a community-led transition rests on their performance across several dimensions combined. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - 1. Urban landscapes often harbour organisms that harm people and threaten native biodiversity. These landscapes are characterized by differences in socioeconomic context, habitat suitability and patch connectedness. Identifying which spatial differences enable outbreaks of pests, pathogens and invasive species will improve targeted control efforts.2. We tested hypotheses to explain the distribution and demography of puncturevine Tribulus terrestris, a human-dispersed invasive plant in Boise, a city in the western United States. We hypothesized an increase in puncturevine infestations near low-valued properties with a high proportion of bare ground, the species' preferred microhabitat, that are well connected on the urban road network. To test these hypotheses, we collected data on the abundance, emergence and persistence of reproductive plants in transects spanning >100 km of our study city. We then used hierarchical Bayesian models to evaluate the impacts of spatial covariates on puncturevine distribution and demography.3. Bare ground cover consistently increased abundance, emergence and persistence of puncturevine, indicating the overarching importance of suitable establishment sites for this invasive species.4. Property value had the strongest impact on puncturevine abundance and was the most important main effect in the model for puncturevine emergence. In both models, lower-valued properties had a higher risk of puncturevine occurrence.5. The effects of road network connectivity depended on bare ground cover, with the highest predicted abundance and emergence of puncturevine in patches with low connectivity on the road network and high bare ground cover. Understanding these relationships will require data that can disentangle seed dispersal from es- tablishment limitations.

AB  - Urban environments consist of a mosaic of natural fragments, planned and unintentional habitats hosting both introduced and spontaneous species. The latter group exploits abandoned and degraded urban niches which, in the case of plants, form what is called the third landscape. In the Anthropocene, cities, open spaces and buildings must be planned and designed considering not only human needs but also those of other living organisms. The scientific approach of habitat sharing is defined as reconciliation ecology, whilst the action of implementing the ecosystem services and functioning of such anthropogenic habitats is called Urban Rehabilitation. However, urban development still represents the main cause of biodiversity loss worldwide. Yet, the approach of planners and landscape architects highly diverges from that of ecologists and scientists on how to perceive, define and design urban green and blue infrastructure. For instance, designers focus on the positive impact that nature (generally associated with indoor and outdoor greeneries) has on human well-being, often neglecting ecosystems’ health. Instead, considering the negative impact of any form of development and to achieve the no net loss Aichi’s objectives, conservationists apply mitigation hierarchy policies to avoid or reduce the impact and to offset biodiversity. The rationale of this review paper is to set the fundamentals for a multidisciplinary design framework tackling the issue of biodiversity loss in the urban environment by design for nature. The method focuses on the building/city/landscape scales and is enabled by emerging digital technologies, i.e., geographic information systems, building information modelling, ecological simulation and computational design. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Due to its carbon impact, building has become increasingly questionable: famous architects and urban designers contend, the disciplines should either deploy mapping skills towards better decision-making, or focus on careful small-scale interventions. A combined approach to climate and resilience addresses contexts of population growth and housing scarcity: The method combines dense conversion of buildings to reduce carbon footprint, together with transformation and revegetation of urban spaces for climate mitigation. Two co-developed projects illustrate in combination a strategy mapping out such urban renewal potentials, testing design at precinct scale through precise interventions, and application through 1:1-prototypes. The design-research investigations propose to look beyond buildings into whole city approaches to urban resilience, which rehabilitate urban structures and spaces. Two complementary blueprint case-studies investigate how landscape can combine with urban renewal strategies to address challenges of climate (urban heat, flooding) and biodiversity (extinction) as well as the very human need for engaging urban spaces. The strategies combine architecture, urban and landscape design to re-envision city spaces as new urban ecologies. They test how to reappropriate underused urban spaces, creating blue-green urban networks of amenity as optimistic perspective for the future. The intertwining studies unpack how we may reconceptualise city spaces as resilient and adaptive urban ecosystems comprising flora, fauna and humans within urban environments. Such ecosystems are able to absorb heavy rainfalls and heat and thus reduce vulnerability to climate change and weather extremes. A first study focused on identifying underused spaces within Melbourne’s existing urban fabric for ecosystems that could host new resilient infrastructures and programs. The redesigned spaces create a balance between urban and natural systems. A second study delved into how to design and implement such ecosystems within urban contexts though a precinct strategy and four 1:1 prototypes. Starting from specific urban spaces, it explored their capacity to host particular types of ecosystems framed around specific endemic animals. The article will develop how these explorations have culminated in an expansion of the one-health concept (WHO, 2024) applied currently in health sciences in the field of urban design and planning. A new expanded concept conceptualizes the interdependency between human, biological and infrastructural health in cities. Thereby, it highlights the importance of thinking the city as an interlinked ecosystem while redesigning urban spaces for resilient and optimistic futures. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.

AB  - Urban forests represent key elements of green infrastructure and provide essential ecosystem services in both the ecological and social spheres. Therefore, forestation planning plays a decisive role in the sustainable development strategies of metropolitan areas and addresses the challenge of maintaining biodiversity while improving human health and well-being. The aim of this work is to present a methodological approach that can be used to identify priorities in urban forest planning and can provide comprehensive responses to ecological and social needs in any metropolitan context. The approach, which is based on interdisciplinary principles of landscape ecology, ecosystem geography and dynamic plant sociology, has been adopted in the Municipality of Rome (Italy). The first step entails defining an ecological framework for forestation plans by means of the ecological land classification and assessment of landscape conservation status. The second step entails setting forestation priorities according to both ecological and social criteria. The application of the method proved to effectively select limited areas requiring intervention within an extensive metropolitan area. Furthermore, it provided responses to sustainability issues such as long-term maintenance of restored habitats, landscape perspective of planning, greening of urban agriculture, improvement in urban resilience, and cost-effective improvement in ecosystem services provision. © 2015 by the authors.

AB  - Background Green infrastructure is a strategic network of green spaces designed to deliver ecosystem services to human communities. Green infrastructure is a convenient concept for urban policy makers, but the term is used too generically and with limited understanding of the relative values or benefits of different types of green space and how these complement one another. At a finer scale/more practical level, little consideration is given to the composition of the plant communities, yet this is what ultimately defines the extent of service provision. This paper calls for greater attention to be paid to urban plantings with respect to ecosystem service delivery and for plant science to engage more fully in identifying those plants that promote various services. Scope Many urban plantings are designed based on aesthetics alone, with limited thought on how plant choice/composition provides other ecosystem services. Research is beginning to demonstrate, however, that landscape plants provide a range of important services, such as helping mitigate floods and alleviating heat islands, but that not all species are equally effective. The paper reviews a number of important services and demonstrates how genotype choice radically affects service delivery. Conclusions Although research is in its infancy, data are being generated that relate plant traits to specific services, thereby helping identify genotypes that optimize service delivery. The urban environment, however, will become exceedingly bland if future planting is simply restricted to monocultures of a few 'functional' genotypes. Therefore, further information is required on how to design plant communities where the plants identified (1) provide more than a single benefit (multifunctionality), (B) complement each other in maximizing the range of benefits that can be delivered in one location, and (3) continue to maintain public acceptance through diversity. The identification/development of functional landscape plants is an exciting and potentially high-impact arena for plant science. © The Author 2016.

AB  - The spatial configuration of urban areas impacts environmental sustainability, social equity, and economic and social resilience. This study examines the intricate relationship between spatial arrangements and the planning and design of BREEAM Outstanding projects in London, UK. It analyses the relationship between urban morphology and the effectiveness of sustainable building practices and contributes to the broader objectives of urban sustainability. This research focuses on London, UK—a city renowned for its complex urban fabric and architectural heterogeneity—using a multi-case study approach to dissect the elements that facilitate the development of BREEAM Outstanding projects. This study analyses key spatial characteristics such as land use diversity, subway network analysis, and street network analysis using betweenness centrality of edges and node degrees. These factors are considered due to their impact on energy performance, carbon emissions, and social sustainability metrics. Furthermore, this research explores how urban design strategies, such as enhanced walkability and mixed-use development, reinforce the success of BREEAM-certified Outstanding-rated projects. The findings of this investigation reveal a correlation between urban environments and the development of BREEAM Outstanding-rated projects in London. By aligning the spatial organisation of urban form with BREEAM principles, urban planners, policymakers, and architects can facilitate the creation of cities that are environmentally sustainable, socially inclusive, and economically prosperous. The research offers substantive insights and actionable recommendations for future urban development, advocating for a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach to sustainable city planning and design. The spatial arrangement of urban form impacts the planning and design of BREEAM Outstanding projects. Findings from current and future research will be used to investigate the connections between spatial arrangement and various categories in BREEAM and how they can influence future sustainable urban environments to set a benchmark for sustainability for contributing to a more equitable urban future. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Many Midwestern cities in the United States have experienced high levels of economic decline and population loss. This deindustrialization has led to thousands of acres of vacant land maintained as grassy habitats. The communities living within these neighborhoods have conceptualized reutilization strategies for this land, including urban agriculture and the creation of small parks of native plantings. In this 2-year study, we examined the impacts of vacant land conversion on spiders within residential vacant lots, community gardens, and planted prairies within the peri-urban park system. At the time of the study, planted prairies on previously vacant land were not common, so those within the park system may serve as a foundation for future plantings. We found that maintained vacant lots contained the most numerous spider assemblages, which was dominated by disturbance-tolerant habitat generalist species. Community gardens contained numerically fewer spiders but a slightly richer assemblage than vacant lots. Similarly low numbers were also found in planted prairies but the assemblage was the most diverse of the greenspaces examined. We also contrasted results at the family versus genus level in order to assess the taxonomic sufficiency relevant for future studies, and found that genus level was important for elucidating the effects of urban land use on these spider assemblages. From this research, we conclude that spiders are an important indicator group of disturbance when examining urban greenspace management and revitalization, and that alteration in greenspace design will influence biodiversity and assemblage composition. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Many cities around the globe strive for create and maintain urban forests to improve human health, welfare and more positive interactions towards nature. Frequently, the only available land has compacted and degraded soils with an altered soil biota. Studies are needed to address soilborne fungi biodiversity especially that of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), essential for plant development. Our aim was to evaluate the AMF community composition and soil infectivity in four urban sites with different disturbance levels and management histories (Córdoba, Argentina). In two urban forests (reference and restored) and two parklands (forested and control), indigenous AMF morphospecies, soil compaction and dominant plant cover were determined together with the soil infectivity in a greenhouse experiment. Results indicated that AMF communities were dominated by Funneliformis geosporum, Glomus brohultii and Rhizophagus intraradices which are considered generalists and resilient to harsh environmental conditions. AMF community composition varied greatly between the undisturbed reference site and the more disturbed parklands. The richness, diversity and soil infectivity were higher in both urban forests compared to parklands and was partially related with the greater variety of plant physiognomies (in restored site), the dominance of arboreal cover (in reference site) and the lowest soil compaction compared to parklands. In the restored forest, AMF richness and diversity were higher compared to the parklands and to the control parkland, respectively. The greater subsoil compaction and the higher percentage of herbaceous cover (mainly monospecific lawn) represented the most disturbed conditions as a consequence of trampling and subsequent soil erosion. We concluded that differences existed between urban forests and parklands sites with variable disturbance intensities and management histories, however, the parameters analysed here do not fully describe the effects of local urban conditions in the composition and infectivity status of AMF in the soil, and hence future research approaches are discussed. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Small island developing states are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including more intense and frequent extreme weather, warming temperatures, coastal erosion, inundation, and coral bleaching. Locally-specific natural resource threats, associated with population growth and tourism, exacerbate these systemic risks, which are particularly acute where community well-being is subsistence-based and directly reliant on ecosystem services. Garden productivity is falling as the cropping/fallow cycle intensifies and culturally and there is loss of observance of traditional resource taboos, eroding the effectiveness of customary management. Ecosystem based adaptations (EbA) provide a fruitful range of interventions and are beginning to attract development funding. We undertook a social benefit cost analysis for a suite of interconnecting EbAs for Tanna in Vanuatu. We found that funds targeted at increasing the productivity of the gardens returns significant social benefit. This also reduces pressure on natural resource threats and can potentially be adopted by all households on Tanna. In addition, increasing the community's capacity to balance formal forest and reef conservation with customary management can provide small, but nevertheless important complimentary benefits. Our programme design included interlinking activities, including a series of demonstration garden plots, extension officers, community radio, a community ranger programme and a tree nursery.

AB  - The growing importance of urban allotments in planning and managing urban areas is due to the combined positive effects on ecosystem services, the economy and human well-being, especially of groups of the urban population that can be vulnerable (e.g. the elderly, immigrants, low-income families). Some studies have highlighted the potential risk of contamination by metals of vegetables grown in urban areas and the lack of appropriate site-specific risk assessments. However, surveys are still lacking on the possibilities of using urban soil as a good substrate to produce vegetables for home consumption. We assessed the soil quality in two areas in Pisa (Italy), one intended for urban horticulture and the other already cultivated for that purpose. We analysed the soils for the main chemical and physical characteristics (texture, bulk density, water stability index, pH, cation exchange capacity, organic carbon, total nitrogen, phosphorous) and elements (Pb, Cu, Ni, Cr, Zn, Cd, As, K, Al and Mn). Our results showed that both areas had physical and chemical heterogeneity due to the effects of urbanization and to the different cultivation techniques employed. The metal content was lower than the guidelines limits, and the soil conditions (pH = 8) greatly reduced the metal mobility. Copper concentration in some of the cultivated area samples was higher than the limits, representing a possible stress factor for the microbial biodiversity and fauna. Our findings demonstrate that site-specific surveys are necessary before planning urban cultivation areas, and educating urban gardeners regarding sustainable cultivation techniques is a priority for a safe environment.

AB  - Urbanization is leading to biodiversity loss through habitat homogenization. The smooth, featureless surfaces of many marine urban structures support ecological communities, often of lower biodiversity, distinct from the complex natural habitats they replace. Eco-engineering (design for ecological co-benefits) seeks to enhance biodiversity and ecological functions on urban structures. We assessed the benefits to biodiversity of retrofitting four types of complex habitat panels to an intertidal seawall at patch (versus flat control panels) and site (versus unmodified control seawalls and reference rocky shores) scales. Two years after installation, patch-scale effects of complex panels on biodiversity ranged from neutral to positive, depending on the protective features they provided, though all but one design (honeycomb) supported unique species. Water-retaining features (rockpools) and crevices, which provided moisture retention and cooling, increased biodiversity and supported algae and invertebrates otherwise absent. At the site scale, biodiversity benefits ranged from neutral at the high-and mid-intertidal to positive at the low-intertidal elevation. The results highlight the importance of matching eco-engineering interventions to the niche of target species, and environmental conditions. While species richness was greatest on rockpool and crevice panels, the unique species supported by other panel designs highlights that to maximize biodiversity, habitat heterogeneity is essential.

AB  - Forests and trees provide food, fuelwood, and construction materials and many environmental benefits, such as erosion control, clean water and air, biodiversity conservation, and carbon sequestration. The forest covers in Ethiopia and that of the Blue Nile River Basin in particular have been deteriorating at a progressive rate. The situation is even worse in the Angereb watershed. The major causes of deforestation and environmental degradation in Ethiopia are increasing population, increasing demand for farmlands, and increasing demand for fuelwood for cooking and construction materials. The effects of poor farming practices and lack of conservation are the main causes for the siltation of the Angereb dam and the pollution of drinking water from the dam. To address these environmental and livelihood problems, concepts of sustainability and ecosystem-based approaches were applied. We involved different stakeholders, such as the Gondar City Administration, Department of Forestry and Agriculture, Department of Water Affairs, Farmers in the Angereb watershed, University of Gondar, and the Corvallis-Gondar Sister Cities Association in the project. Through this participatory approach, the stakeholders identified the natural resource problems in the Angereb watershed, proposed integrated watershed management involving soil and water conservation, agroforestry, tree planting, and reduced siltation of the dam. Through this project, we improved the tree nursery at Weleka and raised multipurpose indigenous and exotic tree species for planting. Farmers were involved in tree planting and agroforestry practices, such as establishing riparian buffers along the streams, alley cropping for soil and water conservation by planting trees on terraces and agroforests/home gardens to address food security. Through this project, 2.5 million tree seedlings were planted on 560 hectares in the Angereb watershed in ten years. Since 2010, 19 water sources were constructed, including drilled wells, hand-dug wells, and developed springs to provide clean drinking water for 1700 households in Gondar city and the surrounding villages. We recommend scaling up the ecosystem-based approaches, using lessons learned on agroforestry, tree planting, and soil and water conservation in the Angereb watershed to the larger Blue Nile River Basin. This will address environmental degradation, soil erosion, and food security, which will have great impacts on survival of Lake Tana and extend the longevity of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) by reducing siltation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The interactive dynamics in the food, water, and energy system as a nexus (FWEN) are critical to the sustainable development of global cities, and they can be mediated by green and blue infrastructure (GBI) in the urban area. Here we provide a comprehensive literature review to examine how GBI affects FWEN in urban centers, an area which is currently understudied. In order to do this, we undertake a systematic review of the literature using a meta-analytic approach and topic modelling. Based on our synthesis, we develop a conceptual framework of the key links between urban GBI and FWEN and the direction and magnitude of the relationship. We found that GBIs can benefit food supply, energy saving, and climate change mitigation but at a price of food safety and water contamination. Well-designed urban construction can help curb the negative effects. Therefore, we need to make deliberate and integrative policy to link GBI with each element in urban FWEN. Moreover, the focus of studies on GBIFWEN links is also heterogeneous across cities: urban agriculture and food security are priorities in cities located in Africa and Asia as well as in lower income and larger cities (but not metropolitan areas), while the cooling effect of green space has been a focus for cities of middle or high income. Finally, current research focuses on isolated analysis, lacking integrated studies needed for decision making supporting tools. While isolated analyses lead to connectivity failures and can result in adverse impacts, integrated analyses can identify interdependencies of environmental resources between parts of a cycle and across different scales, which can increase resource efficiency and minimize environmental degradation. Therefore, our key findings point out the importance of linking the effects of GBI on each component of FWEN in both research and policy making. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The MJA–Lancet Countdown on health and climate change was established in 2017 and produced its first Australian national assessment in 2018. It examined 41 indicators across five broad domains: climate change impacts, exposures and vulnerability; adaptation, planning and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; economics and finance; and public and political engagement. It found that, overall, Australia is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change on health, and that policy inaction in this regard threatens Australian lives. In this report we present the 2019 update. We track progress on health and climate change in Australia across the same five broad domains and many of the same indicators as in 2018. A number of new indicators are introduced this year, including one focused on wildfire exposure, and another on engagement in health and climate change in the corporate sector. Several of the previously reported indicators are not included this year, either due to their discontinuation by the parent project, the Lancet Countdown, or because insufficient new data were available for us to meaningfully provide an update to the indicator. In a year marked by an Australian federal election in which climate change featured prominently, we find mixed progress on health and climate change in this country. There has been progress in renewable energy generation, including substantial employment increases in this sector. There has also been some progress at state and local government level. However, there continues to be no engagement on health and climate change in the Australian federal Parliament, and Australia performs poorly across many of the indicators in comparison to other developed countries; for example, it is one of the world's largest net exporters of coal and its electricity generation from low carbon sources is low. We also find significantly increasing exposure of Australians to heatwaves and, in most states and territories, continuing elevated suicide rates at higher temperatures. We conclude that Australia remains at significant risk of declines in health due to climate change, and that substantial and sustained national action is urgently required in order to prevent this. © 2019 AMPCo Pty Ltd

AB  - The burden of diseases attributable to air pollution is comparable to those of global health risks such as unhealthy diets and tobacco smoking, with many air pollution sources also emitting climate heating gases. In this UK study we estimated the co-benefits of Net Zero (NZ) climate policy on the health benefits of air pollution reduction, increased active travel, outdoor exposure inequalities and indoor air pollution changes. The study focused on two of the largest UK sources, road transport and building heating, with comparisons made between NZ and UK existing policy, referred to as Business as Usual (BAU). Particulate matter (PM2.5), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and Ozone (O3) projections were made between 2019 and 2050, with emphasis placed upon the NZ co-benefits in 2030 and 2040. We compared the UK BAU scenarios with the Climate Change Committee's (CCC) Balanced Net Zero Pathway (BNZP) and Widespread Innovation (WI) pathway. Compared to BAU predictions, BNZP assumptions lead to more electric vehicles, reduced vehicle km, more low carbon building heating, and reduced emissions of NO2 and PM2.5. By 2040 under BNZP, relative to BAU, the buildings sector was predicted to be three times more effective at reducing PM2.5 than road transport. To help reduce the inequality gap the NZ building transition was tailored toward those most in need. Outdoor air pollution exposure inequalities prevailed across the socioeconomic spectrum, especially for NO2, but were less pronounced due in part to NZ policies. Core air quality health benefits for the BNZP buildings sector were £21.3 billion (16.4 to 26.2) by 2050 and £98.4 billion (75.7 to 121.1) by 2154. For the transport sector the health benefits were £9.1 billion (7.0 to 11.2) by 2050 and £36.5 billion (28.1 to 44.9) by 2154. NZ building sector operating costs did not achieve break-even via efficiency savings, but with Greenhouse Gas (GHG) (lower benefits) break-even was achieved in 2052. With additional air pollution health benefits, building-sector time to break-even improved by between 3.1 (2.5 to 4.7) and 6.3 (4.7 to 7.6) years to between 2046 and 2049. Analysis found that removing gas cooking at home, for NZ, may result in greater concentration reductions than outdoor air pollution for NO2. Net Zero health and economic co-benefits are large, as are the changes needed, requiring political leadership and public engagement. Our findings are relevant to other countries facing the NZ transition. © 2024

AB  - Inclusively accessible green areas are essential for livable cities. The residential greenery on a door's step of urban dwellers has rarely been the subject of research. Here we provide insights into the state of the art of residential greenery in Berlin, Germany. We focus on socially disadvantaged neighborhoods exposed to high loads of environmental stressors and belonging to four relevant building types of Central European cities. 32 plots in eight sample areas were randomly chosen and surveyed during 2017 and 2018. We surveyed the presence of structural elements, the presence and abundance of woody species and the health-related ecosystem (dis-)services (i.e., species' air filtration and allergenic potential). We analysed the similarity among tree species to assess plant use patterns. The air cleaning and allergenic potential of woody species were assigned based on literature. In order to discuss strategies to improve residential greenery, we performed an analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of these green spaces. We revealed a high dissimilarity of woody species assemblages across sites and within different building types, indicating no common plant use fashion. Recorded species provide moderate to high air filtering capacity. One to two third of all trees have a high allergenic potential that has to be addressed in future plant use decisions. Bike racks, benches, lights and playgrounds are common elements, whereas bioswales, facade-bound greening, atrium, fountains or ponds are rare. Their implementation can enhance the health and wellbeing of local residents. Building-attached greenery can improve densely built up areas of the Wilhelminian period, whereas space-intensive measures can be implemented in the spacious greenery of row-buildings settlements of the 1920s-1970s and of large housing estates of the 1970s-1980s. We revealed a high motivation for (co-)design and care by residents and discussed strategies on transformation towards multi-functional, healthy and biodiversity-friendly residential greeneries.

AB  - Like heterotrophic organisms, cities live on the basis of a strong imbalance between the relevant inflows of matter and energy and outflows of waste and emissions, which can extend over large areas. The data of the ecological footprint of cities have quantified emblematically this imbalance. The rapid growth of urbanization, especially in developing countries, is a matter of serious concern. Unsustainable by definition, cities generate environmental impacts of all kinds, with intensities that vary according to the characteristics of the areas in which they develop. Italian cities are a significant case study, for the high density of population and economic activity, the shortage of green areas, the internal mobility largely centered on the private car, as well as for the frequent breaches of the rules and laws oriented to protect the environment. Air pollution is one of the major environmental problems, especially in some cities of the country where industrial activities with high environmental impact are located. After a critical review of the literature focused on the relationship between environmental depletion, air pollution, and health conditions in Italian cities, this chapter explores the case of Taranto, a city of Southern Italy with serious problems of pollution and public health due to the presence of a large industrial area. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Allotment (AGs) and community gardens (CGs) are types of urban gardens that provide diverse ecosystem services (ESs) such as climate regulation, beautiful landscapes, biodiversity and food security. Despite this, there are no AGs or CGs in many developing countries such as Iran. One of the main reasons for the lack of development of CGs in developing countries is the lack of proper understanding by policy-makers and citizens regarding the economic value of the ESs provided and the lack of disclosure of the benefits of its construction in urban areas. The purpose of this study is to analyse the preferences of citizens, to examine the existence of a potential market, to estimate the willingness to pay (WTP) for the creation and operation of CG services and to investigate the factors affecting residents’ WTP in Dezful, Iran. For this purpose, a choice experiment, based on the stated preferences valuation approach, was applied through interviews with 170 respondents living in Dezful urban area. The data were collected during the autumn of 2022 and analysed using conditional logit model. The results indicated that the responding citizens are willing to pay 4.57 USD per month to create CG and operate its ESs in Dezful. Amongst the attributes and ESs of the community garden, citizens valued cultural services the most, followed by provisioning services. In addition, the variables “age”, “being native”, “education”, “household expenditure level” and “awareness and recognition of CG ecosystem services” had a significant effect on WTP. According to the results, it is suggested to follow the policy of creating CGs with the participation of citizens instead of focusing only on the creation of urban green space with a government budget and heavy financial burden. CGs, while providing diverse ESs, can generate sustainable incomes for municipalities and accelerate the movement toward sustainable urban development. © Mostafa Baniasadi & M. Eydipour.

AB  - Urban flood risk assessment delivers invaluable information regarding flood management as well as preventing the associated risks in urban areas. The present study prepares a flood risk map and evaluate the practices of lowimpact development (LID) intended to decrease the flood risk in Shiraz Municipal District 4, Fars province, Iran. So, this study investigate flood vulnerability using MCDM models and some indices, including population density, building age, socio-economic conditions, floor area ratio, literacy, the elderly population, and the number of building floors to. Then, the map of thematic layers affecting the urban flood hazard, including annual mean rainfall, land use, elevation, slope percentage, curve number, distance from channel, depth of groundwater, and channel density, was prepared in GIS. After conducting a multicollinearity test, data mining models were used to create the urban flood hazard map, and the urban flood risk map was produced using ArcGIS 10.8. The evaluation of vulnerability models was shown through the use of Boolean logic that TOPSIS and VIKOR models were effective in identifying urban flooding vulnerable areas. Data mining models were also evaluated using ROC and precision -recall curves, indicating the accuracy of the RF model. The importance of input variables was measured using Shapley value, which showed that curve number, land use, and elevation were more important in flood hazard modeling. According to the results, 37.8 percent of the area falls into high and very high categories in terms of flooding risk. The study used a stormwater management model (SWMM) to simulate node flooding and provide management scenarios for rainfall events with a return period ranging from 2 to 50 years and five rainstorm events. The use of LID practices in flood management was found to be effective for rainfall events with a return period of less than 10 years, particularly for two-year events. However, the effectiveness of LID practices decreases with an increase in the return period. By applying a combined approach to a region covering approximately 10 percent of the total area of Shiraz Municipal District 4, a reduction of 2 - 22.8 percent in node flooding was achieved. The analysis of data mining and MCDM models with a physical model revealed that more than 60% of flooded nodes were classified as "high" and "very high" risk categories in the RF-VIKOR and RFTOPSIS risk models.

AB  - Strengthening sustainability starts with maintaining a balanced relationship between society, the environment, and the economy, and one of the pillars of doing this is increasing the amount of green infrastructure and expanding it in urban areas. Densely populated urban areas with fewer greenery are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, including sea level rise, storm surge, heat waves, droughts, and changing diseases, and vulnerable populations in urban areas are likely to be disproportionately affected. In addition to providing multidimensional benefits to all ecosystems, urban greenery is influential in developing sustainable lifestyles and healthy eating habits, increasing individual well-being derived from the need for a sense of belonging and social inclusion, as well as reducing carbon footprint. As urban greenery is part of urban development but less attention is paid to it, the benefits of these areas should be further explored and highlighted. Thus, ten questions were raised concerning the contribution of urban greenery to the future of urban areas. The questions not only to address important issues related to urban greenery and to provide guidance for future studies, but also to offer new perspectives for future policies. The answers to the ten questions are based on the expertise of the authors to highlight the importance and the potential of urban greenery in shaping the future.

AB  - Research has shown that time access restrictions in city centers might increase social sustainability aspects such as livability or safety, but might also increase the number of vehicles and the total distance travelled; which have negative environmental impact and can decrease economic sustainability. In this paper we see that this negative effect could also be the result of other access restrictions, like load factor restrictions, and may be related to factors other than the number of vehicles and total distance travelled. Such as if the distribution center is in the outskirts of the city and customers are situated outside the city center. In this study a common urban distribution network scenario is presented - the milk run - where only the load factor is changed. Increasing the load factor is usually regarded as a way of improving efficiency, but we observe that under certain conditions improving the load factor affects economic and environmental sustainability, by increasing total costs and emissions. Following insights from this study, implementation of policies and business decisions in urban freight distribution are recommended not to use single key performance indicators. Following insights from this study, policy makers and companies should be careful when using single key performance indicators in urban freight distribution. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Urbanization and achieving sustainable agriculture are both major societal challenges. By reducing food miles and connecting people with nature, food cultivation in cities has several major advantages. However, due to further urban development (peri-) urban agriculture (UPA) is under threat. To strengthen UPA, we argue for considering UPA as a nature-based solution (NbS) supporting systemic approaches for societal challenges. However, academic knowledge on UPA's contribution to various societal challenges of urbanization is still fragmented. This study addresses the gap by conducting a systemic literature review, incorporating 166 academic articles focusing on the global north. The results of the review show that UPA contributes to ten key societal challenges of urbanization: climate change, food security, biodiversity and ecosystem services, agricultural intensification, resource efficiency, urban renewal and regeneration, land management, public health, social cohesion, and economic growth. The value of UPA is its multifunctionality in providing social, economic and environmental co-benefits and ecosystem services. When implementing UPA, social, institutional, economic, technical, geographical, and ecological drivers and constraints need to be considered. To upscale UPA successfully, the study develops an integrative assessment framework for evaluating the implementation and impact efficiency of UPA. This framework should be tested based on the example of edible cities.

AB  - As green spaces are a common feature of liveable cities, a detailed understanding of the benefits provided by these areas is essential. Although green spaces are regarded as a major contribution to the human well-being in urbanized areas, current research has largely focused on the cities in developed countries and their global importance in terms of public health benefits remains unclear. In this study, we performed a multiple linear regression using 34 cities in different regions across the globe to investigate the relationship between green spaces and public health. Our analysis suggested that for richer cities, green spaces were associated with better public health; whereas a greater area of green spaces was associated with reduced public health in the poorest cities. In contrast to previous studies, which typically found positive relationships between green spaces and health benefits, we demonstrate that health benefits of green spaces could be context dependent.

AB  - Ensuring food security, improving sustainability, and, at the same time, demonstrating the widely perceived economic value are challenges presented by commercial urban agriculture. This article explores the economic, social, and environmental factors that contribute to commercial urban agriculture as a response to sustainable development. Therefore, using text mining, a scientific survey of information was carried out to verify the predominant approaches in the literature. The economic causes are the main drivers of the activity, especially when related to the generation of employment and income, minimization of costs along the supply chain, and the proximity of the local market to the consumer. Investigations on environmental sustainability have shown significant growth in recent years, as commercial urban agriculture contributes to changes in the interactions of the urban environment, especially for land use, ecosystem conservation, biodiversity, climate improvement, and urban landscape. There is also evidence of a positive outlook on the future of urban agriculture characterized as an indispensable activity for the local production of sustainable food, which tends to minimize the pressures on conventional agriculture and contribute to facing global challenges. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The rapid transformation of Earth's surface through urbanization presents critical challenges for ecosystem sustainability and climate resilience. This study employs advanced remote sensing and geospatial technologies to monitor and assess the spatiotemporal dynamics of urban ecosystem services in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, over three decades (1993-2023). Using multi-temporal Landsat imagery analyzed through Support Vector Machine algorithms in Google Earth Engine, we achieved high-accuracy (>85%) land use/land cover classification to quantify urban expansion patterns and their impact on ecosystem service values (ESVs). The analysis revealed significant urban intensification, with built-up areas expanding by 145.70 km(2), resulting in the conversion of 130.74 km(2) of barren soil, 7.14 km(2) of vegetation, and 7.71 km(2) of water bodies. This transformation led to a substantial reduction in ESVs totaling $477.48 million, with the most significant impacts on hydrological regulation (-$114.25 million), waste treatment (-$97.05 million), and biodiversity protection (-$72.78 million) services. The spatiotemporal analysis demonstrated clear patterns of ecosystem service degradation, particularly in the city's central regions. Our findings provide crucial insights for achieving UN Sustainable Development Goals (Target 11.1, 6.6., 13.1, 3.9 and 15.1) by quantifying the environmental costs of rapid urbanization and informing evidence-based urban planning strategies. The study's innovative integration of remote sensing, machine learning, and ecosystem service valuation offers a robust framework for monitoring urban ecosystem dynamics and supporting sustainable urban development in rapidly growing arid regions.

AB  - The quantity of urban forests in cities is critical for biodiversity conservation and human health, and is known to be distributed unequally. Increasingly, the quality of urban forests are also being recognised as shaping the benefits they provide. Previous studies and reviews have demonstrated that the quality of urban green spaces is associated with patterns of inequality as measured by socio-economic status and race (in the U.S). This study extends this body of knowledge to urban forests by systematically reviewing the urban forest literature (that explicitly study the urban forest) exploring the relationship between urban forest quality and both socio-economic status and race. Two academic databases (SCOPUS and Web of Science) were systematically searched. A total of 2012 papers were screened and 21 articles were included in this study. Almost all studies (20/21) found evidence of inequality, with at least one significant association between measures of urban forest quality and socio-economic status or race. However, 6 studies found contrasting patterns, with lower socioeconomic status areas having higher urban forest quality. There was variation in the type of ‘urban forest’ studied, and variation in the ways both urban forest quality and socio-economic status were measured, making inter-study comparisons difficult. Interestingly, the literature was geographically diverse, and future research could continue to focus on countries in Africa, South America and Asia with diverse needs for and uses of urban forests. In conclusion, this review finds evidence for inequity in the distribution of urban forest quality. Future research that more clearly describes the urban forests being studied and that explores sociocultural variation in perceived quality would allow better generalisation and understanding of forest quality patterns. © 2022

AB  - Land use, transport, and energy-environment integration (LUTEI) is receiving considerable attention as an elaborate approach to improving urban resilience. Research evidence on this multidisciplinary topic tends to be fragmented, hindering constructive analysis of its role in shaping sustainable cities. This paper addresses this by undertaking a holistic systematic review to consolidate diverse perspectives. The analysis of 195 reviewed papers identified four main clusters of knowledge that include methodological approaches, policy instruments, urban design elements, and impacts of interventions. The analysis revealed that a growing body of literature is increasingly focused on improving accessibility planning, transit-oriented development, and policy integration to achieve sustainable and healthy transport as a vital element of resilience in cities. The review found, however, that the integration of environment and energy into land use and transport models is still at a nascent stage of development and has largely been overlooked in traditional LUTI models. This can lead to unreliable assessments of the impacts of low-carbon mobility solutions, emerging green transport technologies, and long-term changes in energy consumption affecting sustainable mobility futures. This paper concludes by connecting LUTEI dimensions to the UN’s sustainable development goals (SDG), outlining future directions to ignite meaningful research on the topic and providing a transparent path for decision-makers to adopt LUTEI-informed planning. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Urbanizing regions increasing challenge the ecosystem's capacity to deliver important ecological services to the human population and support human well-being. Scholars of urban ecology have hypothesized that the patterns of urbanization control ecosystem dynamics through complex interactions and feedback mechanisms linking urban activities and their spatial organization to land cover and environmental change. However, empirical studies of the underlying processes and mechanisms linking urbanization patterns and ecosystem dynamics are still extremely limited. In this paper, I present a framework linking urban patterns to ecosystem functions and discuss a set of hypotheses based on the empirical evidence established in the literature.

AB  - Understanding sociocultural perceptions about human-nature relationships is essential to promote collective responses for sustainable ecosystem management. This study explores the sociocultural factors that influence subjective well-being (measured by life satisfaction) and how ecosystem services are perceived in an area inhabited by the Kichwa people, for whom the ancient notion of Good Living (Sumak Kawsay) is active. We carried out 482 surveys in five villages along a rural-urban gradient in the province of Imbabura (Ecuador). Rural and urban people differed in their subjective valuations of well-being components and the sociocultural factors that most influence life satisfaction. We also detected changes along the rural-urban gradient regarding how these sociocultural and subjective well-being factors explain the degree of importance that local people attribute to different ecosystems services provided by high Andean ecosystems. Formal education, the perception of local ecological knowledge, and the use of the Kichwa language were identified as important sociocultural factors that explain the observed differences. Finally, we discuss the risks of the ongoing expansion of urban lifestyles for the conservation of Andean social-ecological systems, highlighting the importance of maintaining traditional practices and beliefs associated with the Kichwa culture.

AB  - Watershed investments, whose main aim is to secure water for cities, represent a promising opportunity for large-scale sustainability transitions in the near future. If properly designed, they promote activities in the watershed that enhance ecosystem services while protecting nature and biodiversity, as well as achieving other societal goals. In this paper, we build on the concepts of ecosystem services and boundary work, to develop and test an operative approach for designing and assessing the impact of watershed investments. The approach is structured to facilitate negotiations among stakeholders. Its strategic component includes setting the agenda; defining investment scenarios; and assessing the performance of watershed investments as well as planning for a follow-up. Its technical component concerns data processing; tailoring spatially explicit ecosystem service models; hence their application to design a set of “investment portfolios”, generate future land use scenarios, and model impacts on selected ecosystem services. A case study illustrates how the technical component can be developed in a data scarce context in sub-Saharan Africa in a way that is functional to support the steps of the strategic component. The case study addresses soil erosion and water scarcity-related challenges affecting Asmara, a medium-sized city in Eritrea, and considers urban water security and rural poverty alleviation as two illustrative objectives, within a ten-year planning horizon. The case study results consist in spatially explicit data (investment portfolio, land use scenario, impact on ecosystem services), which were aggregated to quantitatively assess the performance of different watershed investments scenarios, in terms of changes in soil erosion control. By addressing stakeholders' concerns of credibility, saliency, and legitimacy, the approach is expected to facilitate negotiation of objectives, definition of scenarios, and assessment of alternative watershed investments, ultimately, to contribute to implementing an adaptive watershed management. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.
