**1. Introduction and background**


We specify and estimate a joint model of residential density, vehicle use, and fuel consumption that
accounts for both self selection effects and missing data that are related to the endogenous variables.
Our model is estimated on the California subsample of the 2001 U.S. National Household Travel Survey
(NHTS). Comparing two California households that are similar in all respects except residential density,
a lower density of 1000 housing units per square mile (roughly 40% of the weighted sample average)
implies an increase of 1200 miles driven per year (4.8%) and 65 more gallons of fuel used per household
(5.5%). This total effect of residential density on fuel usage is decomposed into two paths of influence.
Increased mileage leads to a difference of 45 gallons, but there is an additional direct effect of density
through lower fleet fuel economy of 20 gallons per year, a result of vehicle type choice.

This paper measures the relationship between residential density, household vehicle use, and household vehicle fuel use. It
contributes to a large literature on the impact and/or desirability of low-density suburban development, frequently called “urban
sprawl,” that has dominated development in the U.S. since World
War II. Increased vehicle usage associated with suburbanization or
urban sprawl has been linked to increasing global warming, emissions, and other problems (see Pickrell and Schimek, 1999, and
Kahn, 2000). Urban sprawl is not simply low density, but also involves scattered development, commercial strip development, or
large expanses of single-use development. Nevertheless, density is
highly correlated with almost all measures of urban sprawl and is
the measure used most frequently in this literature (see reviews by
Ewing and Cervero, 2001, and Badoe and Miller, 2000). When used
alone as an indicator of sprawl, density should therefore be inter

preted as a proxy for access to employment, shopping, and other
travel destinations. The main reason density is used so frequently
is that it is one of the few indicators of sprawl that is consistently
measured across space and time, and it is readily available in most
relevant data sets.
Aggregate studies examining the bivariate relationship between
vehicle miles traveled and density find a large significant inverse effect (see Newman and Kenworthy, 1999). These studies are
flawed because they do not account for the possibility of residential self-selection, which is the tendency for those households that
prefer non-private vehicle travel to locate in dense areas with more
transit and shorter trip distances. Many studies use disaggregate
household data to attempt to control for observable differences
between households living in low and high density areas. One of
the best of these is Bento et al. (2005), which used the 1990 National Personal Transportation Study to build disaggregate models
of number of vehicles per household and vehicle miles traveled
(VMT) per vehicle. They supplemented the density measures in the
data with road density, rail and bus transit supply, population centrality, city shape, jobs-housing balance, population density, land
area, and climate. Bento et al. (2005) found that the magnitudes of
the impact of any of their built environment measures were frequently statistically insignificant and small in magnitude.
Although disaggregate studies that include a rich set of socioeconomic control variables (e.g. Bento et al., 2005) are less subject

to residential self-selection bias, it is still possible that residents of
high density areas differ in some unobservable characteristics that
influence their travel behavior. The only way to deal with this possibility is to build joint models of residential (or density) choice
and travel behavior. One of the first studies to do this was Boarnet
and Sarmiento (1998). They used the percentage of buildings built
before 1945, the percentage of buildings built between 1945 and
1985, the percentage of residents more than 65 years old, and the
percentage of foreign residents as instrumental variables for residential density, and they found no stable link between density and
VMT.
Bhat and Guo (2007) use San Francisco Bay Area data to build
an ambitious joint model of residential location and number of
household vehicles. Their model allows for self-selection effects
(correlation between the error terms in their equations), but after controlling for a rich set of covariates they do not find any
significant effects. Bhat and Guo find statistically significant but
quantitatively small impacts of built environment measures (street
block density, transit availability, and transit access time) on vehicle ownership.
We also directly model the joint choice of density and VMT to
control for potential selectivity, and we also include a rich set of
socioeconomic variables using the California subsample from the
2001 National Household Travel Study described in the next section of this paper. We chose to work with California because it
has as much variation in the key variables as the U.S., but is relatively homogeneous in climate, fuel, and vehicle prices. Unlike
previous studies we also explicitly model vehicle fuel consumption
to account for the possibility that residents of high density neighborhoods choose smaller, more fuel efficient vehicles. This might
be due to the relative difficulty of maneuvering and parking large
vehicles in dense neighborhoods. Fang (2008) uses the same data
to show that residents of dense neighborhoods choose fewer trucks
and more small cars.
Unlike Bhat and Guo (2007) and Fang (2008) we do not explicitly model the number of vehicles or their type. This greatly
simplifies the econometrics and allows us to easily deal with problems caused by non-random data selection as described in the next
section. The third section describes our simultaneous equations
model in which residential density, vehicle usage (VMT), and fuel
consumption are joint endogenous variables. The fourth section describes the results, which are similar to previous studies in finding
a statistically significant but quantitatively small impact of residential density. Even though our model allows for joint causality
between the endogenous variables, our preferred model has density causing VMT (as in Bento et al., 2005) and fuel usage. The final
section concludes and argues that the impacts of increased residential density are too small to make increasing density a relevant
policy tool for trying to reduce VMT or greenhouse gas emissions
from residential vehicles.

**2. Data**

_2.1. 2001 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS)_

The NHTS is a household-based travel survey conducted every
five years by the U.S. Department of Transportation. There are 2583
California (CA) households in the 2001 NHTS sample, representing
9.9% of the total base sample of 26,038. The survey was conducted
over a period of fourteen months ending in May 2002. Daily travel
was collected using one-day trip diaries for all household members, and data on non-commuting trips of at least 50 miles to the
furthest destination was collected for a four-week period. Household vehicles were defined as all vehicles generally available to
household members including motorcycles mopeds and recre


generally a few months apart, in order to provide accurate data on
annual vehicle miles of travel. The 2001 NHTS is described in detail in exhibits, reports, and codebooks maintained on the NHTS
website (ORNL, 2004).

_2.2. Vehicle ownership and fuel usage_

This study focuses on the energy used by all vehicles owned
or leased by California households, including vehicles otherwise
available to households for the general use of household members.
The weighted frequencies from the NHTS show that 7.5% of California households have no vehicles, 33.8% have one vehicle, 35.0%
have two, 15.2% have three, 5.4% have four, and 3.0% have five or
more vehicles. As is usual in surveys of this type, households with
the fewest numbers of vehicles are under-represented in the sample.
The procedures used to estimate annual fuel usage for each vehicle in the survey are reported in Schipper and Pinckney (2004).
Reported and imputed odometer readings, together with fuel economy test results for each vehicle make, model and vintage, are
adjusted for on-road shortfalls of vehicle dynamometer test results,
seasonal variations, and relationships between total mileage and
average trip lengths. The resulting annual fuel usage and annual
miles traveled variables are much more accurate than those available in previous versions of the NHTS. Since annual mileage and
exact vehicle make, model and vintage are needed to compute fuel
usage, 2079 (80.5%) of all California NHTS households have full information on transportation fuel usage.
Since each household vehicle must be accounted for in order for
full energy consumption information to be computed, the proportion of households with full information is a decreasing function of
vehicle ownership level. It is difficult to collect odometer readings
for households with many vehicles since the survey respondent
may not have ready access to all of these vehicles when the survey
firm calls to collect the data. Full energy information is available
for the vast majority of 1- and 2-vehicle households (91 and 86%
respectively), but less than half of all households with four or more
vehicles have available energy consumption information. Since the
number of vehicles is endogenous in our models, this means that
the sample of households with complete energy information is not
a random sample. We describe the econometric techniques we use
to produce consistent estimates later in this paper.

_2.3. Land use densities_

The 2001 NHTS provides several measures of land use related to
household location. Population per square mile and housing units
per square mile are provided at the block group and tract level.
Percentage of renter-occupied housing units is provided at both
the block group and tract level, and jobs per square mile are provided the tract level. As expected, these seven land use variables
are all highly correlated. The typical correlation between any two
is above 0.7.

_2.4. Vehicle usage and land use_

As expected, there is a significant negative relationship between
fuel usage and land use density. Each of the seven land use variables was tested, and the strongest relationships were found for
dwelling units per square mile at the Census block group level.
Consequently, we show only the results for the housing density
variable, but the other six land use variables exhibit similar patterns. For (urban) densities greater than 50 housing units per
square mile, both total annual mileage on all household vehicles
and total fuel usage generally decline with increasing housing den

are statistically significant, and linear relationships cannot be rejected at the p < 0.01 level for either series. The slope of the
curve is greater for fuel consumption, indicating that there is a
positive relationship between effective vehicle fuel economy and
urban density. Indeed, effective fuel economy, measured by the ratio of total mileage to total fuel consumption, ranges from a low
of 19.7 miles per gallon for households located in areas with densities less than 50 housing units per square mile, to a high of 22.4
miles per gallon for households in areas with greater than 5000
housing units per square mile.
These relationships are caused in large part by differences in
household vehicle ownership levels. As shown in Table 1, vehicles
per household ranges from a high of 2.2 vehicles per household
for households located in areas of 50–250 dwellings per square
mile, to a low of 1.4 vehicles per household for those located in
the highest density areas. The differences in fuel economy can
be attributed to vehicle type choice differences involving size and
power of cars and to the greater number of pickup trucks, vans,
and SUVs in lower density areas. As shown in Table 1, the likelihood of owning one of these three types of trucks increases with
decreasing density, and there is no reversal of the trend at the lowest density as there is for mileage and fuel usage. Since 1990 the
fleet average fuel economy for light trucks was no less than 20.2
miles per gallon while the fleet average fuel economy for cars was
no less than 27.5 miles per gallon (see NHTSA, 2008).
Of course, different types of households choose to live in areas of different residential density. Quite a few socioeconomic and
demographic variables were found to describe choice of residential density in the model presented in the next section. Two of the
variables that stand out are the number of household drivers and
average household income. The last two rows of Table 1 show that
households living in more dense neighborhoods have fewer drivers
and lower income.
It is apparent that different types of households choose to live
in areas defined by different residential densities. These households have different patterns of activity participation and travel,
and choose to own or lease or otherwise have available different numbers and types of vehicles. To account for such selectivity
effects of land use on vehicle fuel consumption, we specify and estimate a structural equation model that contains both density of
land use and vehicle usage as endogenous variables.

**3. Structural model of density of land use and fuel usage**

_3.1. Model specification_

We estimate the effects of land use variables on fuel usage by
specifying a simultaneous equation model with three endogenous
variables and many exogenous variables. The three endogenous
variables are: total annual miles driven by all household vehi


of gasoline equivalents per year (F ), and housing units per square
mile in Census block group described previously (D). Our preferred model is given by the equation system below, where A and
_B are coefficient matrices, Xi is a vector of exogenous household_
attributes, and ε is a vector of residuals with an unrestricted correlation structure. We need to put restrictions on the coefficient
matrices to identify the system. We have chosen to identify our
system primarily by restricting the A matrix to the recursive system shown below. We also impose enough restrictions on the B
matrices to identify the system (see Table 3), but these restrictions are based on removing insignificant variables. The excluded
variables from the B matrix are therefore weak instruments, and
estimates are essentially unchanged when all exogenous variables
are included in each equation.
In the context of our model, residential self-selection implies
positive correlations between the structural errors (ε). We cannot
reject the null hypothesis that all of the error correlations are zero,
and this is consistent with other studies (e.g. Bhat and Guo, 2007)
that condition on a rich set of socioeconomic variables. Note that
this finding of no significant error correlations does not mean that
there are not self-selection effects, but it does imply that the included socioeconomic variables capture these effects.

_Mi = A1,3_ _D_ _i + B1 Xi + ε1,i,_

_F_ _i = A2,1_ _Mi + A2,3_ _D_ _i + B2 Xi + ε2,i,_

_D_ _i = B3 Xi + ε3,i._

Our recursive model starts by assuming that the choice of residential density is only a function of exogenous household characteristics. This is equivalent to assuming that households first choose
their residential location and then choose their vehicle holdings
and driving patterns conditional on this choice. Density, which is
a proxy for access to employment and other destinations, affects
total miles driven, but after controlling for exogenous sociodemographic factors fuel usage is assumed to not directly affect total
miles driven. Density also affects fuel usage since households in
denser neighborhoods choose more fuel efficient vehicles. Density
is postulated to affect fuel usage by both decreasing total miles
driven and increasing vehicle fuel economy.
The exogenous variables in the structural equations model are
designed to capture all sociodemographic characteristics related to
choice of density and vehicle use (see the definitions in Table 2).
In many cases we include indicator variables of common household types along with counts of children, workers, and drivers. This
combination of count and indicator variables allows for flexible
nonlinear impacts of key sociodemographic characteristics. A continuous variable was constructed for income by using the midpoints of the 10 categories used in the survey instrument, with
$170,000 assumed for the top category, and $35,000 assigned for
missing incomes. All of the overidentifying restrictions in our preferred model passed the specification tests described below. In
particular, we could find no economically or statistically significant
“backward” links from fuel usage to land use density. Note however that removing any of the exogenous characteristics from the
model leads to rejection of the null hypothesis that the error correlations are all zero. This highlights the necessity of including a rich
set of sociodemographic controls to avoid residential self-selection
bias.

_3.2. Weighting and estimation methodology_

which requires full energy information, is not a random sample
of any population The strongest factor causing missing energy in

is closely related to the endogenous variables in our model. This
means that the estimation sample is effectively stratified on an endogenous variable, which implies that standard estimation methods will yield biased coefficient estimates and inferences. There
are two basic approaches to getting valid estimates in this situation (see Wooldridge, 2002, Chapter 17): the “structural” approach
and the weighting approach. The “structural” approach adds an
explicit equation explaining whether a household has complete energy information and then estimates this equation together with
the structural equations model described above. The weighting approach uses weighted estimation where the weights compensate
for the different probabilities of having complete energy information. The weighting approach is almost always inefficient, but
unlike the structural approach it doesn’t rely on functional form
assumptions that are hard to justify.
We began by trying the structural approach using Heckman’s
(1979) two-step estimation method. This method starts with a separate binomial probit model of whether the household has complete energy information. Under the assumption that all of the
errors in the system are normally distributed, the Mill’s ratio estimated from this probit equation can then be added to the substantive structural equations model to control for the bias caused by
non-random sampling. When applied to our data this showed that
there was no substantial bias. However, small changes in model
specification led to strong rejections of the no bias hypothesis.
A simple Ramsey test for the joint normality assumption can be
carried out by adding the square and cubed Mill’s ratio, and this
test strongly rejected the joint normality assumption.
We therefore adopted the weighted estimation approach, and
we estimated the weights so that the weighted distribution of
the number of vehicles (categorized by 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 or
more vehicles per household) in our sample of 2079 households
with complete energy information matched the distribution in the
entire sample of 2583 California households in the NHTS. The resulting weights range from 0.8 for the 0 vehicle households to
6.4 for the 5 or more vehicle households. Note that we did not
use any additional exogenous socioeconomic information about the
households to improve the weights since we directly control for
these exogenous factors in our structural equations models Adding


the weighted estimation methods, but it is important to adjust the
weights when using the estimates for population projections and
simulations.
Our structural model is:

_yi = Ayi + Bxi + εi,_

_Cov(εi) = Ω._

The weighted estimator we use is defined by:

min _w_ _i_ _(I −_ _A)_ _yi −_ _Bxi�′Ω_ −1�(I − _A)_ _yi −_ _Bxi_ _._

Where the weights, w _i_, are the inverse probability of selection. The
covariance of the weighted estimator above is given by:


_V = Ψ_ [−][1]ΛΨ [−][1],

#### � Ψ = −E ∂ 2 w i Li(θ, xi),
 ∂θ∂θ [′]
 �� �� Λ = E ∂ w i Li(θ, xi) ∂ w i Li(θ, xn)
 ∂θ ∂θ [′]


#### .


Once the weights are estimated, then most standard software for
structural equations models can perform the weighted estimation.
Unfortunately these softwares typically use Ψ [−][1] to estimate the
covariance of the estimator, and this is clearly biased. We therefore use a “wild” bootstrap (Horowitz, 2002) to generate standard
errors for our weighted estimates. This bootstrap works by taking
the vector of estimated residuals, ei, for each observation and multiplying by:


#### (1 − 5)

with Probability = _[(][1][ +]_
2 _(2_


5)

####,
5)


#### (1 + 5)

with Probability = 1 − _[(][1][ +]_
2 _(2_


5)

#### .
5)


This implies that across the bootstrap repetitions the residuals
will have mean equal to ei and covariance equal to eie[′]i [, which]
is the same approximation used to derive White heteroskedasticconsistent standard errors. This bootstrap procedure has the advantage that it will yield consistent standard errors even if the errors
in the model are heteroskedastic. We used 200 bootstrap iterations, although we checked our final results using 1000 bootstrap
iterations, and the results were very stable. We found that the
incorrect standard errors (Ψ [−][1]) were downward biased by from
10–1000%, and the weighted estimates are statistically and operationally significantly different from unweighted estimates in many
specifications.
One drawback of using weighted estimations is that they are
not equivalent to maximum likelihood, so standard likelihood ratio tests of overidentifying restrictions cannot be used. We implemented a bootstrap test for overidentifying restrictions (including
the restrictions on the residual correlation matrix) by bootstrapping the difference between the restricted and unrestricted reduced forms for the various models we examined. The reduced
form is given by:

_yi = Cxi + μi_

and the overidentifying (or structural) restrictions are given by:

_C = (I −_ _A)[−][1]_ _B,_

_Cov(μi) = (I −_ _A)[−][1][′]_ _Ω(I −_ _A)[−][1]._

Our test statistic is given by:

where C R are the restricted reduced form estimates, C _U are the_
unrestricted reduced form estimates, and Σ is the bootstrap variance estimate of (C R − _C_ _U_ _). If the restrictions are correct then this_
statistic follows a Chi-squared distribution with degrees of freedom
equal to the number of restrictions. This test appears to work well
since it ruled out many possible model specifications.
Finally, we also implemented a simple Hausman (1978) test for
the null hypothesis that the weights are actually exogenous. This
test compares the weighted estimates with standard maximum
likelihood estimates ignoring the weights. When applied to our
preferred model this test also does not reject the null hypothesis
that the weights are exogenous, but, as with the “structural” Heckman test, this result is very sensitive to slight changes in model
specification. We therefore decided to be conservative and use the
weighted estimates for our empirical results. Although inefficient,
they are consistent under the widest array of assumptions about
the underlying data generation process.

**4. Estimation results**

The best model uses housing density at the Census block level,
although the other six land use variables also produce acceptable
models and similar results. The structural equation model was estimated using weighted three stage least squares with bootstrapped


in Table 3. Note that the estimates in Table 3 are computed under the assumption that the structural errors are uncorrelated. The
overidentifying restrictions for this model cannot be rejected at
any usual level of confidence. Table 4 gives the restricted reduced
form estimates corresponding to the structural model in Table 3.
The reduced form gives the total impact of the exogenous variables on endogenous variables. Note that the exclusion restrictions
imposed on the structural model in Table 3 imply different exclusion restrictions on the restricted reduced form in Table 4 due to
the nonlinear relationship between the two models.
The squared multiple correlations for the structural equations
are 0.11 for housing density, 0.37 for annual mileage, and 0.95 for
annual fuel usage. For the reduced-form equations, the squared
multiple correlations are 0.11 for housing density (same as the
structural R[2] because there are no endogenous variable effects on
housing density), 0.37 for annual mileage, and 0.42 for fuel usage.

less dense area. This is the net effect of vehicle ownership level
and trip patterns. The household in the denser area will consume
64.7 fewer gallons of fuel, and this effect of residential density on
fuel usage is decomposed into two paths of influence. The mileage
difference of 1171 miles leads to a difference of 44.7 gallons (using 0.0382 gallons per mile, the estimated direct effect of mileage
on fuel consumption, implying a fuel economy of 26.2 miles per
gallon). However, there is an additional direct effect of density on
fuel consumption of 20 gallons per 1000 housing units per square
mile. This is due to the relationship between residential density
and fleet fuel economy, a result of vehicle type choice.

_4.1.2. Exogenous variable effects_
_4.1.2.1. Number of drivers_ As expected, the number of household
drivers has a strong influence on household annual mileage and
fuel consumption. However, the number of drivers also affects the
choice of residential density. Thus, the total effect on mileage is
due to both a direct effect and an effect channeled through residential density. In turn, the effect on fuel consumption is a sum
of a direct effect, an effect channeled through mileage, and an
effect channeled through residential density. The total effects on
each of the three endogenous variables are nonlinear, as captured
by up to four variables: a continuous “number of drivers” variable, and dummy variables for one-driver, two-driver and three-ormore-driver households.
Drivers per household has a negative diminishing marginal effect on choice of residential density All else held constant the


a residential area that is less dense by 840 dwelling units per
square mile, when compared with a household with no drivers;
a household with two drivers will locate in a residential area that
is less dense by about 450 dwelling units per square mile, when
compared with a household with one driver; and the difference
in density between two- and three-driver households declines to
about 200 dwelling units per square mile.
The influence of drivers per household on annual vehicle usage
and fuel consumption does not exhibit such diminishing marginal
effects, and the main nonlinearities involve the effects of more
than two drivers. Based on the reduced form results in Table 4,
adding the first driver in the household increases annual mileage
by 10,100, and adding an additional driver leads to an additional
8700 miles per year. From two to three drivers per household the
added mileage per year is 15,100 miles, and from three to four it is
13,800. The effects of the number of drivers on fuel usage follow
the same trend, but the rates of increase per driver are slightly
greater. This is due to an additional positive direct effect of the
number of drivers on fuel usage, indicating a lowering of fleet fuel
economy as a function of the number of drivers.

_4.1.2.2. Number of workers_ There is a positive linear effect of the
number of workers on residential density. Households with more
workers tend to live in higher density areas, ceteris paribus. As in
the previous case of household drivers, the total effects of number
of workers on annual mileage and fuel usage are both nonlinear,
each being captured by three variables: a continuous variable and

worker households. However, in contrast to number of drivers, the
greatest marginal effect for number of workers is the difference in
mileage and fuel consumption attributed to the difference between
two to three workers, which is significantly greater than the differences between one and two workers, and somewhat greater than
the difference between zero and one worker. The model implies
that increases in total household mileage are generally shorter
for the second worker in the household and longer for the third
worker, in comparison to the first worker. Fuel consumption per
worker generally tracks annual mileage, with the exception that
fuel consumption is more linear than mileage in the range of zero
to two workers, implying that first workers generally use more fuel
efficient vehicles.

_4.1.2.3. Income_ The model predicts that fuel usage increases linearly with income, and this is caused by all three factors. Higher
income translates into: (1) choice of lower density residential location, (2) greater total driving distances, independent of the greater
distances caused by lower densities, and (3) lower overall fuel
economy of the household fleet.

_4.1.2.4. Number of children_ Fuel usage increases with number of
children due to two factors. Larger families tend to choose lower
residential density, which in turn increases total mileage. In addition, fuel economy decreases as a function of the number of
children, due to increased likelihood of a least one van or SUV in
the household fleet.

_4.1.2.5. Education_ Only two education dummy variables were
found to be significant. Households headed by a respondent with
a college degree tend to have a vehicle fleet with greater overall lower fuel economy than their less educated counterparts. This
effect is accentuated if the household is headed by a respondent
with a postgraduate degree.

_4.1.2.6. Life cycle effects_ Retired two-person households tend to live
in lower-density residential areas. However, the positive influence
of lower residential density on fuel consumption is partially offset by a vehicle fleet with higher fuel economy, probably due to a
lower likelihood of vans, pickup trucks and SUVs.
Households with older children choose to live in lower density areas. In California, many children over sixteen years of age
have driving licenses, so the effects of this variable on vehicle usage and fuel consumption should be combined with the household
drivers variables. If an additional household driver is a child 16–21
years of age, the model predicts that the additional vehicle usage
and fuel consumption will be less than if the driver is not such a
child.
Finally, non-retired single-person households also tend to live
in higher density areas. This translates into lower annual mileage
and fuel consumption strictly through the direct effect of land use
density.

_4.1.2.7. Race and ethnicity_ Four race and ethnicity variables were
determined to have significant effects on choice of residential density and mobility. Households which are solely Black, solely Asian,
solely Hispanic, or mixed White and Hispanic, all tend to reside
in higher-density areas, compared to other households, predominately solely White households. This leads to lower vehicle usage
and fuel consumption for all of these groups. In addition, there
are possible direct travel and fuel economy effects for Asian and
Hispanic households, but these effects are not estimated with precision. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of
these and other demographic influences on residential transporta


**5. Conclusions and directions for further research**

We specified a simultaneous equation model that accounts for
self selection effects in estimating the influence of residential density on household vehicle annual mileage and fuel consumption.
This model was estimated using a method that corrects for missing
data that is non-random and related to the endogenous variables.
Once we included a complete set of sociodemographic control variables, we could not reject the hypothesis that there are not significant self-selection effects (similar to Bhat and Guo, 2007). We find
that density directly influences vehicle usage, and both density and
usage influence fuel consumption. Comparing two households that
are similar in all respects except residential density, a lower density of 1000 (roughly 40% of the mean value) housing units per
square mile implies a positive difference of almost 1200 miles per
year (4.8%) and about 65 more gallons of fuel per household (5.5%).
This total effect of residential density on fuel usage is decomposed
into to two paths of influence. Increased mileage leads to a difference of 45 gallons, but there is an additional direct effect of
density through lower fleet fuel economy of 20 gallons per year,
a result of vehicle type choice.
Unfortunately for those wishing to use land use planning to
control residential vehicle use, it is very difficult to increase the
density of an established urban area by 40%. Downs (2004, Chapter 12) shows that increasing the density of an existing metropolitan area by 40% requires extreme densities of new and infill development. Bryan et al. (2007) have recently developed a consistent
historical database of U.S. city and regional densities. These data
show that only 30 out of 456 cities increased population density
more than 40% between 1950 and 1990, and the median city in
this sample decreased population density by 36%. The cities that
did increase population density by more than 40% are similar to
Santa Ana, California. They experienced large increases in lowincome immigrants into very tight housing markets. The increase
in densities in these cities was largely accommodated by cramming
more people into the existing housing stock. Of course, increasing
dwelling unit density is even harder than increasing population
density.
As expected, the most important exogenous influences are
number of household drivers and number of workers, but education and income also are significant. Isolating the effects of
number of workers on fuel consumption allows the development
of models aimed at forecasting the effects of employment levels on residential transportation energy consumption. There are
also demographic, race, and ethnicity effects, as retired households
are more likely to live in less dense residential areas, and singles
and non-White households are more likely to live in denser areas.
This research can be usefully extended in a number of directions. Adjunct geographic location information can be merged into
the NHTS dataset to provide more information about the households’ neighborhood characteristics. For those households in major
metropolitan areas it might be possible to obtain information on
accessibility to public transportation. An expanded model can then
be developed to jointly determine public transit accessibility along
with residential density and transportation energy use.
Detailed geographic information can also be utilized to empirically examine the claim that balancing the number of residences
and jobs within a community will reduce residential transportation
fuel use. Tract-level Census data could be used to develop measures of “jobs-housing imbalance” for each of the NHTS California
sample members and then test whether these measures have any
significant impact on vehicle use and fuel use.
The present method for handling the endogenous sample selection caused by missing energy information also invites improve

yield the same quantitative results. The structural method should
yield more efficient estimates if the equations explaining the missing data process are correctly specified. The problem is likely due
to the joint normality assumption required by standard structural
methods. Bhat and Eluru (2008) have developed a promising new
methodology using copulas can be used to relax this assumption.
Finally, the present research concentrates on California, using
only that portion of the NHTS national sample. This work can be
expanded to the national level, both as a check on the stability
of the models and to empirically examine the claim that California
driving behavior has unique characteristics that cannot be captured
by standard socioeconomic measures.
